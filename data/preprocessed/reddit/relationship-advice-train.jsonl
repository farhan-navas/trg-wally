From my earliest childhood memories, to well into my 40s.\n\nEleven years ago I cut off my entire family due to my brother's actions. I was already scarce for family events. But one situation was the tipping point. So, i cut everyone off.\n\nI didn't want to make my parents choose when making plans for holidays or dinners. So, I made the choice for them. I didn't see or talk to them for years. My daughter, who was in middle school at the time, would still see them. That was my only interaction. Picking her up. \n\nAbout 5 years ago I started to slowly speak with my parents more. My relationship will never be the same. They are not the type to talk about what happened. And since I have always been independent, they probably just chalked it up to that. We have a more surface level relationship. And honestly, that is fine with me.\n\nMy brother wasn't the \"golden child\" where he could do no wrong in their eyes. He was the problem child. And I was the well behaved older sibling that had to suck it up. And to be honest, we are very similar. And one time I even tried to have a heart to heart with him years prior telling him I understand him and I want to help him. We just handled our lives, choices, and everything differently."}, {"role": "user", "content": "That sounds very much like my situation. My brother has always been ‚Äúpoor, little brother who has this trouble or that trouble‚Äù. I, on the other hand, have always been the big sister who just figures it out and no one ever blinked twice when I had a problem but rush to help him when he has. I would joke that when we were children my brother would scrape his knee and my mother would be fretting over him and wouldn‚Äôt notice for a moment if I was next to him bleeding to death."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Then going NC with your parents will give you the peace and time you need. It doesn't have to be permanent. However long you need or want.\n\nYour brother most likely won't change without getting therapy and possibly medication. So, if you ever decide to have your parents in your life, you can do it on yoir terms. And if they wish to be in your life they will accept those terms.\n\nIn my case, I never expressed \"these are my terms for my relationship with you\". I just did what was best for me. And they didn't say anything about it. Typical boomer parent/Gen X only and oldest daughter way. ü§∑\n\nAs I said, I had always been independent. Whether it was truly my personality from the get go, or if it was a coping mechanism, I don't know. Maybe a bit of both.\n\nYou will have moments you feel bad, sad, angry. But it subsides and you create a life for your self with people that want to be in your life.\n\nEdited for spelling."}]}

The issue might be on both of you for not talking it right away, as both of you started spiralling in your own heads.  From his point of you, your resenting his answer either means that you are jealous of his past, or that you don't trust him not to fancy her NOW. There is obviously no reason to be sad that your SO fancied someone in the past. And while this girl is flirtatious, he is in a relationship with you. So you need to be honest to yourself first, and to reciprocate the honesty he showed to you: why did his answer hurt your feelings?   Tbh i don't think there is a huge breach here, as long as both of you find the maturity to talk it through, you will be fine.  Sorry about the lame English, i'm not a native"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Heya, Ty for the response. And don‚Äôt worry your English is perfectly fine :) I do trust my boyfriend and he has hung out with her in the past while I‚Äôve been away (we are in a LDR). I guess I just wasn‚Äôt ever expecting him to say that he would‚Äôve dated her, and it caught me off guard. We‚Äôve both had previous relationships and this is also something I have no issue with (in fact I have met his previous gf). I can‚Äôt really explain why it upset me, other than I never anticipated it, she‚Äôs not someone that fits his ‚Äútype‚Äù at all, and it was a total surprise. That‚Äôs all I can say really."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Past relationships are over for a reason. This is potentially one that got away and it now raises the question, what if she prepositions him *now?* How will he react?\n\nPeople will attack you for not trusting him, but his reaction is that of an untrustworthy person. He swore at you. He yelled at you. He made you apologize to him and you did in hopes to deescalate. But it didn't work, did it? And what exactly was your crime again? Having the wind knocked out of you for a moment?\n\nThat is all bad behavior on his part, and I'm sorry, but it is a much bigger concern than Flirty McGee.\n\nHonestly, IME, trust is a momentum that must be maintained. It is not inertia. It is OK to question blindly trusting someone when they hurt us. His reaction was not a safe one, and blaming his childhood was rich. What if you have childhood trauma? Will he excuse himself while further invalidating you? Will he continue to threaten to not share things with you because you dare to feel some type a way and try to process those feelings?\n\nI'm going to tell you right now that the last one is most worrying to me. My husband uses that excuse to hide things from me and lie to me. He won't accept that when he first betrayed me with lies was the reason why I have trouble trusting him. Instead, he rather blame me for his lying. It's a mindfuck and I hate my life. Don't accept this treatment for fear of being marked as jealous or being shamed for not blindly trusting someone after they've hurt you.\n\nAnyway, it's ok to question. That doesn't make you a jealous person. It's perfectly reasonable to do when new information is obtained. What makes a person jealous comes from how they handle trusting/not trusting someone."}]}
