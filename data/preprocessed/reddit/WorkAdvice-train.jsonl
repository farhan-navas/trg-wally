They are technically designated men‚Äôs/woman‚Äôs rooms, but when one is occupied and you need to go, most people just use whichever is not occupied. \n\nThere is an older woman at work who cornered me in the parking lot the other day about my bathroom habits, basically telling me that she ‚Äúhad three babies‚Äù and pees a LOT and thinks that I spend too much time in the bathroom and that she‚Äôs going to start knocking when she has to go and I‚Äôm in there, blah blah blah. I do have stomach issues so when I‚Äôm in there I do usually need around 10ish minutes, so initially I thought the conversation was weird but I was like‚Ä¶ok I guess?? I don‚Äôt really know how to change my bathroom habits bc it‚Äôs not something I can control lol and there is also another bathroom she can always use if it‚Äôs a genuine emergency and she just needs to pee quick. She also made a big deal about wanting to do this ‚Äúprivately‚Äù and ‚Äúnot wanting to embarrass me‚Äù and just kept saying that over and over again in our conversation. \n\nI found out the next day that immediately following our conversation she went inside and was talking to multiple people about the conversation she had with me (so much for not wanting to embarrass me and trying to keep it private???) and had been making comments about ‚Äúhow much easier it is to get into the bathroom now‚Äù even though I literally haven‚Äôt changed my bathroom habits AT ALL since we spoke? And it seems like my bathroom trips have become a frequent subject of her general office talk. The same person who told me all of this (a close trusted friend) told me that she has notifications set up on her teams to monitor my activity and tell her when I am and am not active/in the bathroom. Mind you, our jobs NEVER intersect, we have absolutely no reason to ever message or even work with each other and she has zero authority over me, so she has absolutely no reason to monitor my teams activity to tell her when I‚Äôm active or not active so she can see when and how long I‚Äôm in the bathroom for. \n\nFor additional context, I‚Äôve been at this company for almost four years and no one has ever said anything to me about the time I spend in the bathroom, and this woman has been here for six months and suddenly it‚Äôs an issue? I‚Äôm honestly just insanely mortified and violated and just like sick over this. I want to talk to HR but I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm overreacting, even though it absolutely infuriates me to find out that this is something that this woman is actively monitoring and frequently brings up to other employees. I want to scream I‚Äôm so mad, but am I insane for feeling that way? I‚Äôm like, maybe I do take too long in the bathroom? But I literally can‚Äôt help it!! And there‚Äôs also another bathroom she could use!! So I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do! She makes me so uncomfortable I just never want to speak to her again, and I want to go to her boss but based on what my friend is telling me it seems like her boss might kind of in on it too and that it‚Äôs become just this weird joke of sorts that I just haven‚Äôt been aware of for months. Ugh I just want her to know that I know and I want her to be as uncomfortable as I am. Would I be overreacting by saying something?\n\nEdit: an additional thing I‚Äôm worried about is outing my friend for telling me and ruining her relationship with this woman bc they have to work very closely with each other. Not to get into specifics, but even if I don‚Äôt explicitly say it was my friend who told me, it would be very obvious and there wouldn‚Äôt really be any question as to how or why I know all of this now. And since the only thing she really did to me was say something to me in the parking lot and then knock on the bathroom door the day after our conversation, all of the things I want to complain about (like monitoring my teams which I just think is so inappropriate) are things that I wouldn‚Äôt know unless my friend had told me.
