However im the husband here. \n\nMy kid is one of a kind level of difficult, and yes friends with kids around us says so too. \n\nMe and my wife fought so much ever since my kid came into our lives, my capacity of engagement drops to the point where i rather not talk. We do not even have a maid. I take care of chores, she settle the LO.\n\n 1st question is, are you headstrong as well? Do you hear yourself talk and try to speak in a nicer tone? \n\nMost of our issues stems from being short fused, our snappy tones and the choice of words we use. \n\nDo not harp on minuscule things on parenting, it will eventually tire both you and your husband out. Coming thus far, a child is a child, as long as they are healthy they‚Äôre alright. \n\nI do not have friends, i do not spend time outside and i dedicate my free time being present, cause that‚Äôs the least i could for my wife and kid, but somehow my wife always feels that it isnt enough. \n\n\nWe do not have grandparents that could help us in taking care of our kid as well. \n\nI do understand that mothers usually bear more mental load as they care more about the gentle parenting side of things, but realistically there is only so much we can do. \n\nTry to go into a deeper convo about the issues with your husband to understand what he thinks and feel. Most times i‚Äôve seen are wives who are mad about every minuscule things that the husband do or say. Eventually this behaviour will tire husbands out. Be the wife that‚Äôs chill. \n\nBad news is, going out on a date with your husband will never feel the same anymore, and its ok. It is normal. Love isnt always butterflies, we just have to make things work.\n\nThe happy lovey dovey married couple you see outside? Either one of them doesnt have to work, do not have to fret about money, or they have grandparents who offer help to take the kids off  their hands so they have free time. \n\nThose who are married and can still have huge gathering every other week? Either their kids are easy, or THEY themselves are easy and chill with their kids. Bottom line, every household situation is different, DO NOT compare your family to others."}, {"role": "user", "content": "To add on, \n\nI have seen a few couples getting divorced because of these problems after having a kid, all just because the mums are very headstrong on a certain way to bring their kids up.
