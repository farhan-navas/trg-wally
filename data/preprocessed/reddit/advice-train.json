And yeah, there’ve been fights who doesn’t have those? But tonight hit different. Like, what even is this relationship” kind of different.\n\nSo here’s what happened: I got home from work, just dead tired. Tossed on some sweatpants, reheated leftovers, and hopped on my PlayStation to unwind for a bit. Nothing major just a couple rounds with the boys. She comes in, sees me playing, and immediately starts going off about how I care more about the game than her.\n\nMind you, I’ve only been on for like 25 minutes. I told her, Babe, give me 10 more and I’m all yours.\n\nApparently, wrong answer.\n\nShe snatches the controller out of my hand, yanks the console off the shelf (cords still plugged in), and storms into the bathroom. I’m literally mid-sentence like, What are you doing??\n\nThen I hear it.\n\nSplash.\n\nNo hesitation. My PS5 is now soaking in bubble bath and Epsom salts.\n\nAt first I just stood there. Like is this actually happening?\n\nShe’s screaming about how I never listen, how I don’t show affection, how this is why her mom was right. I’m still stuck on the fact that my digital library and saved games are now marinating next to a lavender candle.\n\nHonestly I didn’t even yell back. I just walked out. I’m in my car right now, still processing. Not even mad  just tired. Like really, really tired.\n\nI’ve been trying to be patient with her anxiety, with her trust issues, with the fact that she goes nuclear sometimes over the tiniest things. But tonight? It felt like something broke. Not the PlayStation well, that too  but something in me.\n\nAnyway. Just needed to vent. Not sure if this is fixable or if I’m just finally seeing things clearly.\n\nAnyone else been through something like this?"

It does sound like she isn’t well equipped to prevent lash outs, and she is responsible for regulating those, you shouldn’t be the one responsible for her behaviour. That reaction is very disrespectful and disturbing. But the reoccurrences she hasn’t been able to deal with must have been present in the relationship for a while. People do break down when they’re overwhelmed by something.\n\nI think OP should balance out his subjective experience with some objectivity, for the sake of his growth and ability to manage relationships.\\\nEven if he chooses a breakup, I think it’s important to acknowledge his shortcomings as well. If he was to get in another future relationship, I think it’s fair to want to look for someone more equipped to communicate and address gaps earlier on, but he has to show up the same way. Perhaps he could also look at whether his views of how relationships dynamics cross his boundaries, and what isn’t healthy to keep going through. Has OP been uncomfortable to consult himself on whether this crosses a boundary for him? Has OP been able to address this with her and himself? Has OP been able to genuinely understand her? Not sure, just asking.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso, OP, sorry for your PS, that’s some expensive equipment there, and as a fellow gamer, i know how precious the saves are.\n\nI empathise with you OP, this sounds tiring and stressful, try and be the bigger person and genuinely speak to her calmly. If she can’t, then it’s ok to step out of something that doesn’t work. In my experience, trying to be the bigger person (rising above the situation, choosing to avoid escalating the conflict or engaging in negative behaviours, refusing to engage in a \"tit-for-tat\" mentality, and instead choosing to de-escalate the situation) has built trust within myself that I have a good grip on life and I got my back."

He's like a little brother to me. \n\nHe's been with his girl for 4 years give or take, and we get to talking the other day about how she's going on some \"vacation\" with 3 guy coworkers... So already an immediate red flag there but he just keeps talking. \n\nHe brings up that he personally knows one of them and how this guy had apparently confessed his feelings/continuously flirts with her and I had a plan in mind... \n\nAfter a few drinks, I got his name from my friend and found him on Snapchat....\n\nBasically I catfished the guy as my friend's girl asking if anything happened... Long and short was no..... But... Idk... \n\nApparently a lot of alcohol was had (which she constantly shames my friend for, if he even has a beer which is WILD to me, but that's not the point), a lot of innuendos were said, a lot of touching and shit from both sides... But then there was 1 more message; she got so drunk that she started twerking/grinding on all 3 of these guys....\n\nI don't know what to do. To me, that's still cheating. \n\nShe hasn't told my friend. I know because I asked if he'd heard from her, which then resulted in him telling me he hasn't heard from her in 2 days, which isn't like her at all. \n\nMy wife thinks I should come clean about the whole thing and send my friend the screenshots I took, but I know it would crush him... He's been cheated on, like ACTUALLY cheated on in the past, and I know this would send him to a very dark place...\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated...\n\nEdit: Yes, I know what I did was fucked up, hence the title. I had a few to many drinks and my wife and I are always protective over him. He's had a rough past, which is why he's now in the military and thriving. Trust me, I've caught enough shit from my wife (for good reason) for doing what I did but I don't regret it. He's a very \"traditional\" guy (ask the dad for his blessing kinda thing). As he has told me, cheating is a very thin line for him, for good reason. It can range from physical to emotional since he's very monogamous, and I think that's where I'm caught up in the do I tell him or not. I know it would be a \"pussy move\" but I think I'd rather make a burner email and send the screenshots that way."

But there’s also aspects of this concept that don’t hold up. \n\nI wouldn’t vomit and have a headache normally, but alcohol causes that. So not all drunk actions are sober thoughts manifest. I certainly don’t want either of those things to happen either, so not all drunk actions are sober desires.\n\nHowever, by drinking alcohol I might cause these things to happen even though I don’t want them to. Therefore I should carefully consider how much to drink or not drink in order to limit these consequences. As such, I am responsible for what happens as a result of my choice to drink. If what happens - or might happen - could be an undesirable consequence, then I should restrain my drinking in a responsible enough manner to avoid these repercussions.\n\nThere’s also aspects difference between someone having “a few too many” and rattling off some prejudice or wild conspiracy they normally wouldn’t vs. someone being “blackout drunk” and behaving erratically and unhinged.\n\nThere are actual physiological changes to brain waves that happen from alcohol consumption. This isn’t just like opening a lid on a jar; sometimes it’s like smashing a jar on the ground. Now there’s broken glass. Either way things escape the jar, but one way causes cuts and bleeding that normally wouldn’t happen.\n\nIn other words, someone has a drink and becomes less subtle and more unfiltered. Someone else has several drinks and becomes physically incapable of rational thought or action. They didn’t have a sober thought about peeing their pants; they did, however, make the choices that got them too intoxicated to control their bladder. They might even say nonsense that randomly pops into their less than functional brain; it might not be an authentic thought, but they are still responsible for what they say and do. \n\nAll that said, if this story is real then everything the girlfriend did crosses lots of major boundaries. I just read your comment and used to think the same way about the other thing, so I wanted to share how my thoughts have changed."

Also nothing wrong with the occasional use of an aid like the blue pill. \n\nBut my guess is that the nerves will fade with more practice so if you’d rather avoid using anything to supplement your shared experience then I suggest either throwing on the occasional condom while you’re masturbating. I’ve had condoms on for that before just simply to avoid the clean up. It’ll help create a more subconscious sense of normalcy when it really matters. \n\nMy other suggestion is to talk to your partner about ways that she can help stimulate you while you’re trying to put the condom on. I’ve had partners in the past put the condom on for me and that was definitely hot enough to keep my FULL attention. I’ve had partners stimulate me while I put a condom on. There’s tons of ways that she could be helpful in that specific moment (even verbal stimulation by saying things that you both know to really turn you on) if she’s willing to help and it already sounds like she is. \n\nBest of luck!"

First time using reddit, but I'm really anxious about this, and I could really use some help. I (17F) have been babysitting for this couple (\\~30M & \\~30F) since I was 15. They have three kids all under 10 who I absolutely adore, but I don't know if I can even babysit them anymore because of this situation. I feel like I need to give some context before we get into the meat of this story.\n\nThese people are new to our neighborhood, and my mom encouraged me and my sibling to introduce ourselves and offer to babysit for them. My sibling ended up working elsewhere, but I hit it off with them and their kids. The parents (Lets call them Amy and Bob) were also super friendly, and I didn't feel uncomfortable, at first. After about a year of watching their kids, I became somewhat of a full time Nanny the summer I was 16. Amy worked full time, and Bob was injured in the line of duty, so they needed an extra hand. I worked somewhere between 4 days a week for about 5-6 hours each day (and I made bank thankfully). Because of Bob's injury, he was home about 1/3 of the time because of his pain and inability to actually care for the kids (which is where I came in). Because he was home a lot, I had a friendlier relationship with him. With Amy we are friendly but it is more professional. This is about the time things started being weird.\n\nWhen I say Bob was friendly, I mean sometimes it felt like he was tethering the line. At first he was just smiley, cracking jokes with me, and seemed genuinely interested in what was going on with my life. But then he started making some comments. It was never about my body or anything, but if I mentioned I was going out with friends, going on a trip, or had plans, he made these comments like \"Don't get into too much trouble\" and stuff like that. I thought it was a little weird, and I mostly thought he meant 'don't do anything illegal' or 'don't drink' which, yeah, still a little weird but I just thought it was a generation difference. But then the comments turned towards more \"Don't have too much fun,\" and many of his comments started having sexual undertones, implying I was going to meet up with someone to have sex, or I was going to meet someone on my vacations. I'm pretty sure he once actually called me \"a freak\" in the sexual sense. I would always laugh off the comments because yeah, they made me uncomfortable. But I'm still a teenager, and I didn't (and still don't) know how to tell a 30 year old man to stop. This is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nA little before this, probably closer to when I was 15, both Amy & Bob followed me on their respective Instagram's (I know *now* that this is enterally unprofessional and I should have not accepted, but I was 15 and this was my first job ever, so give me some grace )*.* Amy posted mostly about her family, while Bob did as well but he also posted about playing video games, gym stuff, and martial arts. I never really interacted with their Instagram's they were just there. Then Bob started sending me reals. And I was stupid enough to send some back. That was it for a while, just funny videos about memes or the occasional news story. There was a LOT. But once again, some of the videos got weird. Sexual. None of them had sex of course, but there were sexual implications about couples having fun, or sex jokes and things like that. I don't mind a sex joke once in a while, but only if its with my friends within my age group. This once again was weird and made me uncomfortable but I didn't know what to say. THEN (of course there's more) he starts texting me on Instagram. And like all other times, it gets weird. It was usually at night, and he mentioned being drunk a lot of the times. He was asking me personal questions, telling me way to much about his life ( I think its important to state that he was groomed as a teen by an older women but just, doesn't realize it? When he mentioned it he seemed to think fondly of it, so maybe its an indication this behavior). He told me I was very mature for my age and nurturing, which was a BIG red flag for me, so I started making excuses.\n\nI told him I'm trying to get off Instagram so much so I delete it a lot (which is true, I did start doing that partially because of this but also because I doom scroll way to much) and I put a one hour timer a day for it recently. When he added me on snap (I felt compelled to add him back when he talked about it in person), I said I don't really do streaks and I'm barely on it (this became true after I added him as well). I think I saw in the back of my mind all of the red flags, and I was defiantly weary, but I tried to just put a distance. I know it seems like there where a lot of instances where I could have shut this behavior down, but once again, I am a 17 year old girl, and this is a 30 year old man whos been in the military. No matter how friendly he is, this behavior makes me nervous, and I don't actually know what will happen if I say anything. Its also important to note that he offered to train me in martial arts when I expressed interest. It never worked out because of my schedule, and I'm honestly glad.\n\nSo now we get to like, two nights ago. I'm on Instagram and I'm using my one hour. He texts me, and I know he saw that I'm active, so I ask him what's up. Bad choice I know, but I also know I can just use the excuse that my phone locked me out if I want to exit the conversation and he asks. So I say what's up, and he asks me to respond to a poll about muscle mass. I think its a little weird, but he's a gym rat so not totally weird, and it seemed innocent enough. So I agree, and instead of a poll he sends a picture, and I'm tired so my dumbass opens it and low and behold, its a boner picture. Of course I close it, and I sit there in shock after closing Instagram for a few seconds. After a while he sends a message saying something like \"I'm sorry if that was too much.\" I simply responded \"It is\" and I've had my phone on DND since.\n\nIf I'm being honest, I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I want to tell Amy but I don't know. I don't think she knows, as she's super busy with work a lot and is very no nonsense. I don't think Bob is a danger to the kids (he has two girls and one boy), but once again, you never know. What if I ruin Amy's life? What if I ruin her family? What if me telling her gets her or the kids hurt? Don't even get me started on my parents. Do I tell them? I love them and they'd be 100% on my side, but I don't know to what extent they'd go. Would they confront Bob? Would they go to the police? I really don't want to go to the police, but what if another girl is in my position and accepts the advances? I'm just really confused, and I'm willing to take any advice. If your still reading this, thanks for taking the time to look at my situation :)\n\nEdit: I've looked at a lot of your comments and thank you all so much for your advice. I'm still not sure what to do, but I have started taking screenshots of some of his messages. I'm a little nervous looking back, because I really did have some nice conversations, but at the points where I'm uncomfortable I'm scared it seems like I'm egging him on. I'm still going to collect evidence. I still don't know if I should say anything, but everyone's advice is really helping me form out a plan if I choose to pursue action. Again, thank you for helping me!"

The positive interactions were all specifically designed to peel back the normal and natural protections you have and leave you conflicted and confused.  He is more than 30 years old, he knew what he was doing and to whom he was doing it.  I have no doubts whatsoever that this is also not his first time doing this.  You are not alone and you are not the first one he has done this to.  Also, *you* don’t do anything wrong.  You are not the one that would ruin Amy’s life-HE IS.  You are not the one that would ruin her family-HE IS.  You are not the one that would hurt Amy or her kids-HE IS, and very likely you would be protecting her and the kids from this predator!  \n\nYou do need to talk to your parents, and you do need to take this to the police.  He needs to be investigated and his secret needs to come out so Amy can decide what to do and how to protect herself and her kids, and future young women can be protected from him.  Please, I know it is scary and I know it feels unreal and unbelievable, but he is depending on you feeling scared and not being willing to tell anyone.  Nothing that has happened or will happen is your fault!  Nothing!  This grown man made the decision to take a relationship into an inappropriate place and then keep going with it.  He is not going to stop until someone stops him.  People like him need the police to get involved and the courts to label him so that communities can know about him and protect themselves from him because he will never be safe to be around.  As far as him telling you that he was groomed by someone when he was young, that makes it doubly abhorrent, he is consciously making the decision to do this when he was a victim too.  It makes me scared for his son as well as his daughters!  \n\nI am sorry that you are having to deal with this.  Please have a conversation with your parents, if you are worried about how they may react, talk to a teacher or guidance counselor at school so they can help you and help your parents to get through the initial shock and figure out how to proceed.  I know parents can sometimes freak out and your concerns about “what extent they’d go” is coming through loud and clear.  Having another adult there to help you navigate this conversation can make a big difference and help your parents to maintain control and not do anything that anyone might later regret.  Confronting Bob is not the appropriate thing to do, and having a trained adult there to help your parents get through their initial feelings may make it a lot easier for you.  \n\nAgain, you are not alone, you did absolutely nothing wrong, you have no blame for what has happened or what may happen in the future, you are brave and strong for standing up and realizing that something is wrong here and preventing this predator from being able to continue to victimize other young people.  You are not responsible for what he has done, you are not responsible for how any other person may react to the truth when they learn it, these are all adults that are responsible for their own actions and their own choices.  I am proud of you, you are a wise and smart and strong young woman."

Yesterday I accidentally killed one that I’ve had a bond with since last year. I don’t know how to cope with this feeling of guilt and grief… I’m embarrassed and ashamed this happened. It’s been my worst fear so I’ve always been careful. But I got excited about feeding a squirrel and I turned around fast without thinking and I ran over the chipmunk with my wheelchair. I’m ALWAYS cautious and click my chair before moving but I didn’t because I was so excited about feeding the squirrel and I turned fast without thinking of my surroundings. all happened so fast… The chipmunk was coming up to me for his daily peanuts and… I killed him. I’m an absolute mess. I can never forgive myself. The chipmunk trusted me, and because of me he is gone. I was just hanging out with him for hours the day before and now he’s dead because of me. I’m in so much pain emotionally and spiritually. I don’t ever want to be born again because life is brutal and I just can’t handle these feelings of loss and guilt. Even though it was an accident, it doesn’t change the fact that I killed him. He is dead because of me and my heart is completely shattered. I took away his life, he will not be running around in the grass and enjoying the summer because of me. I cannot stop crying. Even though he was a wild chipmunk, my bond with him was as if he was my pet. I loved him with my whole heart. I feel so guilty and depressed that this happened. I don’t know how I can cope. How do I live with myself… I feel like I’m in a nightmare. Ive been hesitant to share this because I’m very embarrassed and ashamed this happened but it’s eating me alive and I don’t know what to do… how do I live with what I’ve done"

You don't need to blame yourself.\n\n  \nI similarly killed my pet kitten, and I had bad PTSD about it for years. It took me two weeks to be able to sleep in a bed again, as it happened in my bed (I fell asleep holding it, taking care of a few week old kitten is brutal on your sleep schedule) I mostly just laid on the floor for weeks and cried.\n\n  \nI couldn't sleep for weeks, I couldn't look at a cat without wanting to throw up for years, and eventually I got married and when I laid next to my wife and if she touched me in my sleep, I would wake up crying in a panic attack trying to make sure she was still alive. Eventually, even that went away, and now I've even brought my other cat from my parents house to keep her with me again. \n\n  \nSo you'll get over it, and there's nothing you really need to do to get there except wait and be sad.

We’re 22, we’ve been together since we were 15 years old. \n\nThroughout the last year I’ve felt our relationship was off or going downhill, because he completely stopped wanting to be intimate with me, and our interactions started to mostly feel more like best friends than a romantic relationship. Which at the time, I thought was just a rough patch/side effect that comes with being together for so long, but in retrospect I should have at least questioned lmao. But THIS was the last reason i would have suspected. there really wasn’t any signs until more recently.\n\nHe told me he started having these thoughts and feelings over the last couple months, and when we broke up he assured me that he did have romantic feelings. But at the same time, the last couple months he had still been talking about our future, bringing me to every family function, spending the night at my house, everything seemed completely normal.\n\nThis is so incredibly hard for me. I love this man so deeply, i got so connected to and comfortable with his family, not only were we together so long but on top of that he’s my first love, my first everything, we spent our childhood together, and alot of the time because of my struggles with my family and my own struggles, I felt he was the only person Ive ever met that 100% understood and loved me. As much as I love him and want to be supportive and understanding, I feel a bit betrayed by this? Then I feel wrong for feeling that way. It’s a never ending back and forth in my head.\n\nIt also comes with all the confusion and insecurity. Questioning what was real and what wasn’t, feeling like maybe I wasted so many years of my youth, grieving both a 7 year relationship and my first love/best friend, and just all the insecurity that comes with realizing you spent 7 years with a gay man lmao, even if HE didn’t know it. I know that I didn’t necessarily WASTE those years because I truly love him, felt loved back and was taught so many relationship and general life lessons, but it’s hard to completely not feel that way either. \n\ni catch myself thinking that I wish he would’ve just cheated on me or something cause it would be easier to process or get over. I know i’m very young, and that i’ll meet so many more people and do so many more things, etc. But right now it really does not feel like it, and really does not feel like I will ever have that again. I guess i’m just asking for advice on how to cope with this and move along with my life? I know moving on is my only option here, i just don’t know HOW. Right now I feel very lost."

I was 24 when we broke up and we went through so much shit when we were younger all for it to amount to nothing. Or so I thought. \n\nBut it helped me realize all the things I took for granted, all the things I realized I needed and deserved in my next relationship.

Ever since I have made my own money, I have provided for myself. I saved up $8k to buy my own car when I turned 18, then got a loan for $6k on top of it. neither of my parents helped me finance, co signed, or anything. I did it alone. My sibling, on the other hand, got scared of driving because of one day when my father was teaching us how to drive. My sibling was behind the wheel and in reverse, kept going and we ended up backed closely to a tree so my dad yelled to stop. Ever since, they have blocked out the idea of getting a license or even trying to drive. This was 3 years ago.\nThis brings me to now, I work 32-36 hours a week at a part time job. I have been a CSR for 2 years. My sibling originally started working 15 hours a week 2 years ago, but has since been cut to 5 hours per week. They consistently ask me to look at jobs with them because they want to quit where \nThey are now. I do bring them to work because we have similar schedules on this day. They have made me late for work several times because their time management is shit. I feel like since it is a burden on me and my reputation as an employee to be late due to someone else, I shouldn't have the stress of taking them to a different job, more days in the week. This is where I feel unjustified, although I haven't said anything. \n\nI feel as if I shouldn't be responsible for them getting to work if the job changes. I did not birth them, and I bought my car myself. I would feel differently if my parents supplied the car that I use, but they did not contribute to it or help me in any way to get it. I am also looking for another job, of which will be full time. I work more than my mother does, so I feel like I shouldn't have to worry about the schedule I work because they're not my child.

But the mother needs to shape up and finally be responsible for her child instead of ‘throwing her to the wolves’. \n\nBut that doesn’t mean, her sibling is weighing her down, not when they don’t mean to, they don’t mean to be who they are, and maybe they don’t even know everything about autism and how it affects adults. That’s not their fault for not fully grasping.\n\n*Autistic people isn’t every other grown up.*\n\nSorry you took it upon yourself to write something that didn’t go in your favor!"

That’s accommodating. \n\nShe needs her own space and will communicate to her mother but also has the space to learn about the condition as her sibling grows. \n\nThat’s beautiful on her. Versus you who really does seem bitter. I gave my two cents, from my own point of view, and did OP ever say I said anything out of order? No. \n\nI am autistic, and instead of you who spread negativity, I shed light on people on the spectrum, and support people who aren’t autistic but also let people know, yeah we struggle but we are human as well. \n\nSorry you feel the need to want to spread so much negativity and misguidance when it comes to autism on a post, that isn’t even about *you*, lol!\n\nIt looks like you never got the support or help you needed when you needed it, because you seem very childish. On the spectrum, you should know to be an adult, right? You should know to be not so immature, right? Wrong. Autistic people have issues. You claim you’re an adult on the spectrum, then act like it. \n\nThat’s basically how you’re acting like OP’s sibling should be.\n\nI’m not entertaining this conversation anymore, you’ve proven you’re not capable of handling serious conversations like this. Have yourself a nice life!"

One of my female colleagues (36F) didn’t come in because she was unwell, and out of the entire team including females she's closer with, my manager specifically asked me (33M) to call her, check on how she’s doing, and ask if she needed anything. I am not her boss, manager, or her senior. \n\nI don’t mind supporting a colleague, but I found it a little odd that I was singled out for this task, especially since we’re not particularly close. In fact, I’ve made an effort to keep my interactions with her strictly professional.\n\nFor some context: She lost her husband about 8 months ago, and the past 5 months, she started reaching out to me for both personal and work-related advice. I’ve always kept it professional, but she’d occasionally ask questions that felt a bit personal or political, like whether she should share personal information with another coworker, where she should go for vacations etc. It made me uncomfortable, and I would direct her to our senior for advice since I felt it wasn’t my place.\n\nI ended up calling her on her personal number and made sure to mention that the manager asked me to check in. But now, I’m wondering if I should let my senior (who’s been with the company for years) know what happened, especially since my manager is a new hire (only 3 months in). I don’t want to stir anything up, but I feel like it might be wise to keep my senior in the loop, just in case anything ends up being misinterpreted.\n\nThat said, I also don’t want my manager to feel like I’m undermining him or that I’m complaining about him behind his back.\n\nWhat do you think? Should I keep this to myself, or is it worth informing my senior just to cover myself?\n\nI am confused."

It's weird. \n\n\nIf any of my coworkers bothered me while I was blowing chunks I'd be unimpressed.\n\n\nAnd it's one sick day. You call in for a sick day and then everyone needs to leave you tf alone.\n\n\nThat being said OP could have just said 'I'm not close to [worker], I think [other worker] is a better fit'. They missed the boat\n\n\nGoing to a manager once removed for advice about how to approach a new direct report leader isn't petty. It may have consequences but it isn't *petty*. \n\n\nIf that was the thing chosen to do I'd go to the direct report first, not the manager once removed and say that you're worried whether calling someone not in a leadership role on their sick day could be taken badly (because it 100% can) especially if you're not close to the person. Cheerfully, because you're looking out for them.\n\n\nPersonally though, I'd let it go and if a similar request came up I'd say I did it last time, it's [other worker]'s turn."

The manager arrived a bit late and informed us again, then unexpectedly asked me to call her and check if she needed anything. I felt really uncomfortable with the request, but I went ahead with it because I’ve had a good working relationship with him and didn’t want to seem uncooperative. \n\nI realize this should come from someone in a leadership role, and I was partially at fault for stepping into a situation that wasn’t really mine to handle.\n\nMoving forward, I will be cautious and say no to such kind of requests. Thank you."
