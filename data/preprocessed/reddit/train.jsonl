About 70% of us/them, probably would struggle the same way with what REALLY to do. \n\nYou may want to consider watching her and finding out on your own if things are still happening or not. I guess this really all depends on your level of self confidence and what you think you know about what happened. First off your bro is a keeper for telling you. Thank him profusely. Also, ask him if there was more he didn’t tell you. What kind of fling would weigh on my decision. The fact she felt guilty on her own says a lot. But how much you can forgive is only a thing you can define. We all have different levels that we can handle and how well you can let go matters. \n\nThen decide what to do. i might consider looking back to see if there were signs. I might also consider if she’s more into your relationship now, but most importantly what would affect my choices would be if i could live with what i knew. I probably would try to find more dirt.In all honesty id probably look through messages, or my phone bill to find numbers etc, I’d be skeptical and I’d try to find a way to make her confess. If she’s gotten rid of everything without you knowing, good sign it’s over. If she’s more into you, bring it up. Say what gives you? A few months ago you seemed distant, now you’re back. \n\nYou have to be more vigilant and ask what can you do better. This isn’t an excuse for you to step out, but if you find evidence you need to confront. Or she will do something again. If your doing, is tolerable in your head and not a deal breaker, if you don’t confront and you don’t find evidence , then work on building your relationship better, hold her accountable for her part and thank yourself she stupidly did something and course corrected before she went too far."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mark that to date the only report of her feeling guilty is from the guy who told him about the affair.

Not that it would be your fault—she’s the one who did the thing AND told someone. But it would be a likely consequence.\n\nSetting that aside, I’d be prepared for her to turn it on you. Say that you have been checked out and this guy actually paid attention to her. I’d be prepared to book some couples counseling. Maybe she won’t. Maybe she will just apologize profusely. \n\nBut will an apology be enough for you? And if she does turn it on you, will there be validity to that or just her pulling a DARVO on you? \n\nI personally would be inclined to let it lie.

Alone. Quietly. And wondering if pretending everything is fine is the best way to protect what you’ve built. I want to tell you something clearly, with zero judgment: you’re not weak for wanting to preserve your family. And you’re not overreacting for wanting the truth.\n\nBut here’s the deal: if you bury this, it will not disappear. It will root itself in your bones, in your tone of voice, in the way you second-guess her affection or feel the silence between you stretch longer than it used to. You don’t want to become the man who slowly disconnects because he couldn’t bring himself to say the one hard thing. And you don’t want your marriage to become a lie you both perform to protect the image of love, instead of the reality of it.\n\nThis doesn’t have to be a blowup. It doesn’t have to be war. But it does have to be real. Because your nervous system already knows. Your gut already knows. And the question isn’t “should I confront this?” The question is: what version of me do I become if I don’t?\n\nYou say she felt guilty. That she ended it. That she told someone close. That tells me this wasn’t some cold-blooded betrayal... it was a rupture. And if she’s truly remorseful, there might be space to rebuild something even stronger. But only if the fire is faced. Not hidden. Not denied.\n\nWhen you speak to her, speak from the man you are now, not the hurt husband, not the suspicious detective, but the sovereign man who has nothing to prove and nothing to hide. You can say: “There’s something I know. I haven’t brought it up until now because I wanted to feel steady when I did. I love you. I respect what we’ve built. But if something broke between us, I need us to face it together, not pretend it didn’t happen.”\n\nThat opens the door, not to punish her, but to invite her into truth. And from there, you’ll know if she’s really with you. Not just physically. But emotionally. Spiritually. Intimately. Because here’s what no one tells you: trust isn’t built by being perfect. It’s built by being real. And if you have any shot at making this marriage deeper, not just longer, it starts with the courage to bring this into the light.\n\nWhatever happens next, you walk through it with your head high. Because you didn’t betray her. You didn’t lie. And you didn’t hide. You led. And that’s the kind of man your kids, your future, and even your wife need you to be now."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Wow.  Some of the best advice I have ever seen on Reddit."}]}

We both said it doesn't matter.\n\nToday, she asked me why 'I am so okay' with a male masseuse, at a high end spa, giving her a massage? Like I should have been protective or something. \n\nShe is adamant that a man should not be okay with this. \n\nMy POV, I am absolutely fine with this, like zero issues, it's just a massage in a reputable place. Intrusive or trust related thoughts do not enter my mind. \n\nI told her this question is batsh\\*t crazy (because I trust and love her and it's a high end place - it shouldn't even be a a question), she disagrees, so I said let's ask reddit.\n\nSo Men and Women of Reddit, what do you think?

I feel like I'm in some weird soap opera and have no clue how to end this.\n\nI'm struggling with figuring out how to start this, so I guess I'll just start with context. Obligatory apology for mobile and long post, I'll try to keep it semi brief but there's a lot. I, F28, have been friends with \"Blake\" 28M for about 10 years now. We met when I was traveling for a new job out of state, and I kid you not immediately became best friends in the week that I was there. Same interests, great energy and conversation, we just clicked. \n\nWe were friends for nearly 2 years before trying the dating thing. It lasted *3 months* (important), during which Blake did not treat me well due to unresolved issues from prior relationships. Before I could end it, he decided to end it himself as he had feelings for someone else. Fine with me, we were *clearly* better as friends. I took some space because he hadn't been treating me well, he got into therapy and apologized for being sh*tty, and was willing to put in the work to regain my trust for our friendship. Which he did, consistently, over the 8 years since.\n\nFast forward to now -- I'm now happily married to my wonderful husband Kam (28M, together for 6 years, married for ~2 years). Blake and I are still best friends; he and his ex after our brief dating stint broke up, and he is now with a wonderful woman \"Kaylie\" (21F) for almost 2 years now (started dating a few months before my wedding, this is important). Kaylie and I are also good friends, she's the sweetest person. Blake also lives in the same city as me now after his mother passed, having moved down here for a better support network; his girlfriend moved in about 9 months ago.\n\nIn the past 6 months or so, things have been strained with Blake. My husband is very introverted, and Blake started voicing frustration about his inability to be closer friends with Kam and feeling like he bothers Kam. He and I also started having weird tiffs (kind of subtle negs/belittling comments/etc). Then my husband and I came over to a game night for Blake's birthday 3 months ago, during which Blake picked fights with me about very weird things (for example my career path and how I'm going about it wrong, making comments like \"I guess if you want to stunt yourself in life, you can do it that way,\" etc). Both my Kam and I were caught very off guard, and after several attempts to shut it down, made excuses and headed home. \n\nLater, Blake proceeded to send me a text asking if I was okay bc the vibes felt off. To which I was like \"uh no kidding\", and explained my issue. He decided to reply with...an email (who uses email anymore???). 8 long paragraphs about how he felt he and his experience/knowledge was dismissed in our discussion, how he felt ganged up on when Kam would defend my side, and how he felt like he can't be himself around me and Kam anymore. He also made comments voicing that he didn't feel like he could trust me bc I tell Kam everything (not true, I always ask before sharing unless it's a danger or moral issue) and that he thinks I'm unhealthily codependent on Kam because whenever Blake and I hang out 1x1 I'm always calling to let Kam know how late I'll be out or check if I'm cool to pick up takeout (we're married with joint finances, sue me?).\n\nI replied trying to clarify my end as well as understand where the everloving hell this all was coming from, but no matter how many times I tried, we kept going in circles. The emailing back and forth, during which he demanded we not meet up till this was resolved, lasted till about 2 weeks ago, when I said I needed time to think about how to reply next. About a month ago I got into therapy bc it was seriously messing with my head and making me feel like I was a problem and like I couldn't talk to anyone about this bc we share much of our support system.\n\nI finally broke down to my sister when she came over to see why I hadn't been answering her (or really anyone, yay anxiety) lately. She is also friends with Blake through me. I let her read the emails, and she got pretty ticked on my behalf, and then proceeded to drop a helluva bombshell on me and Kam: *Blake is APPARENTLY \"still in love with me\" and hates Kam's guts.*\n\nApparently, when she drove to pick up Blake out of state for our wedding (he was a groomsman) he \"confided\" in her and her husband that he didn't agree with the wedding and wished I would break up with Kam and give him another chance. That we're soulmates and Kam isn't the one for me. Blake has heard me talk since day one about how happy Kam makes me and how safe and loved I feel with him. My sister shut it down, but, EVEN BETTER, Blake proceeded to do the same thing when she drove him *back home* after our wedding! He ended off saying he just needed some time, so my sister kept her mouth shut bc she knew that he's my best friend and hoped she could trust him to resolve it over time since he lived far away. \n\nBlake then moved near me about a year ago, and Kaylie moved in the August after. My husband's and my wedding anniversary is in October, and apparently Blake *called my sister's husband* to, AGAIN, confide that he's still in love with me and wishes I would divorce Kam bc he would be a better husband to me. While LIVING with Kaylie, who he's told me is his soulmate. This was about when all the stress started, so she never found a good moment to bring it up.\n\nAs if to ice the cake, Kaylie and I have been keeping up via text thru all this (again, we're friends). During the past few weeks, I learned some odd things:\n\n- Kaylie got new piercings, reportedly encouraged by Blake to do so bc \"she'd look so cute\": a double nose piercing and septum, which *possibly coincidentally* Blake took me to get as a post-wedding gift 2 years ago. \n\n- Blake apparently \"has beef with\" the month of August and so has decided their anniversary will be in *October*. The reason he gave was because \"it's spooky month\", but Kam and I started dating AND got married that month. I also, at my sister's prompt, went back and checked when Blake and I broke up -- August 2017. Again, *possibly coincidental*, but feels very odd as I don't know why else he would have an issue with that month.\n\nIt's also worth noting Blake had another relationship fall apart because the girl was outright convinced Blake was cheating on her with me to the point of blasting me for weeks as some homewrecker. Kam and I always chalked it up to her insecurity, but now I'm wondering if she was just watching Blake carry on some weird, one-sided emotional affair. I love my husband more than words can say, and he makes me happier than anyone I've ever met -- he's my ultimate best friend. Learning all this has made me feel so gross and like a horrible wife, though Kam has been wonderfully supportive and doesn't blame me at all.\n\nAll this to say, I'm ending our friendship, but have no clue how. I feel like I have to tell Kaylie as this has all happened during their relationship and living together and the woman deserves the world, but also recognize I have no real proof beyond spoken accounts besides the weird emails -- it sounds like some wild conspiracy theory or soap opera. My therapist is on vacation so I'm on my own after learning all this. I'm also realizing just how manipulative Blake has been for YEARS given this context, and already feel shaky about confronting him given my serious confrontation anxiety, which he knows about and could easily try to exploit. I'm realizing more and more that he has massive control issues that I dismissed as anxiety for years. The fact that he lives so close now fills me with dread rather than joy.\n\nI want to come out of this with no regrets, knowing I stood up for myself, and that I put a decisive end to this. I want Blake to know his actions and creepy ulterior motives are the reason our decade long friendship is dead. I've never ended a friendship myself (also a bit of an introvert), and this is basically friend-breakup on steroids. How do I break this lunacy to Kaylie in a way that sounds remotely believeable given the front Blake has built? I also would love some advice on how to go about telling Blake I know everything and we're absolutely done."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Pretend it's October and ghost the shit out of him."}, {"role": "user", "content": "No need to ghost!

Songbird's best bet for PEACE for herself & Kam is to just end it with finality WITH BLAKE, disengage from both couples (social media blocks), and move on to her & Kam's best lives."}]}

I love my husband more than words can say, and he makes me happier than anyone I've ever met -- he's my ultimate best friend. Learning all this has made me feel so gross and like a horrible wife, though Kam has been wonderfully supportive and doesn't blame me at all.\n\nAll this to say, I'm ending our friendship, but have no clue how. I feel like I have to tell Kaylie as this has all happened during their relationship and living together and the woman deserves the world, but also recognize I have no real proof beyond spoken accounts besides the weird emails -- it sounds like some wild conspiracy theory or soap opera. My therapist is on vacation so I'm on my own after learning all this. I'm also realizing just how manipulative Blake has been for YEARS given this context, and already feel shaky about confronting him given my serious confrontation anxiety, which he knows about and could easily try to exploit. I'm realizing more and more that he has massive control issues that I dismissed as anxiety for years. The fact that he lives so close now fills me with dread rather than joy.\n\nI want to come out of this with no regrets, knowing I stood up for myself, and that I put a decisive end to this. I want Blake to know his actions and creepy ulterior motives are the reason our decade long friendship is dead. I've never ended a friendship myself (also a bit of an introvert), and this is basically friend-breakup on steroids. How do I break this lunacy to Kaylie in a way that sounds remotely believeable given the front Blake has built? I also would love some advice on how to go about telling Blake I know everything and we're absolutely done."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When I read this and this is a whole different side of it, but datable friends are not really doable in a marriage.

Her arms are so empty. Her heart is so broken & her spirit is crushed. Only she can decide when it’s time to pick up the pieces. But she will never be the same again. She’s a mommy with no baby. It hurts. I was lucky. My husband not only planned the funeral, got all the baby’s stuff out of the house, he had the landlord switch us to a different house. I had the pleasure of cleaning it- disgusting. But kept me busy. Then the depression hit. For a long time. Then one day it hit me. My daughter wouldn’t want me doing this to myself. I wanted to make her proud. So I when I got pregnant a yr later, I used the loss of my first daughter to make sure I never took my child for granted. That I made every moment count. She’s 30 now, I still try to remember that moment when they place them in your arms & it takes your breath away. I still try my best to be the best mom I can. For both of them. But trying to find a positive in it, it was hard but it helped me. I don’t know if it will work for your wife or not but it’s only been a yr. For a mom, that’s not that long. Try to help her find something that means something- plant a garden in your son’s honor, volunteer. Going back to work. Medication may help.

Then I went to insta and they have a chat there as well, she send him a reel that said “imagine me looking up at you while your hair is grabbing my ponytail” to which he replied “that send a shock through my body😨”.

So let’s just go with the ‘innocent until proven guilty’ theory and for arguments sake say that your bf is NOT cheating but maybe this co-worker is coming on to him, and this can be explained away and with proof.  If you walk away without giving your bf an opportunity to explain the situation he might resent that fact.  And ultimately resent you for the snooping (phone) and breakdown of trust and communication. \n\nHave you two ever faced this sort of challenge before?  Has there been infidelity in your relationship?  Do you know this co-worker?   I ask these questions because I too am a firm believer in ‘go with your gut’ and your gut told you to check his phone.  And although what you found on his phone was indeed nauseating, it isn’t exactly concrete evidence of cheating.  Gross misconduct, absolutely, but not full blown cheating (imo).  And if you make a serious accusation and decide for the both of you that the relationship is over then you just need to be prepared that if you are wrong that there maybe be no turning back.  That’s my only word of caution.  However, you may not be able to stomach what he has to say if you confront him…. that’s a real consideration.  \n\nNgl, the messages between your bf and the co-worker don’t sound great.  And my mind would go where yours, and everyone else’s, did.  But sometimes things aren’t what they appear to be.  And because of fear, vulnerability, humiliation and a while bunch of other stuff, we sometimes make decisions that might not best serve us.  The outcome may be exactly the same but the way in which we get there can be so vastly different."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why would she care if he resents her if she breaks up with him and leaves? Thats not her problem anymore."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The debate I was having was just that although the evidence against the bf is damning it may not prove infidelity.  There could possibly be an innocent explanation for the message exchange.  And that if she were to make the accusation, and walk away from the relationship without letting the bf defend or explain himself, he may resent her for lack of respect and trust.  It’s a cautionary warning.\n\nOf course the flip side of that is, and to your point, that if anyone finds themselves in a position such as this, they need to make decisions that best suit them.  If they deduce that their partners actions are unforgivable and are confident in a decision to leave a relationship, then have at it; leave without regrets or regard for resentment.  You’re right…not her problem anymore!"}]}
