I don't know how to ask for more\n\nI (30M) have been seeing this girl (25F) for a few months. she sometimes gives me extra food that she made and says \"it's too much\" so she \"needs help getting rid of it.\" but let me just say, it's the BEST food i've ever had. Her friends also always talk about how good her food is so i know i'm not biased. she hasn't had extra food to hand out in awhile. I really want to ask her for more food but I can't figure out a way to ask without sounding like a misogynist who believes women belong in the kitchen. She has opened up to me before and expressed her frustration with cooking because it always felt like a chore for her when she had to cook for her younger siblings every day till she graduated from high school. she's had a hard life and grew up in foster care so i don't want to overstep and remind her of trauma. how does one ask? or should i just forget about it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "“I really loved that dish you brought the other day can you teach me how to make it?”"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I think if not asked very carefully and considerately this is a bit tone deaf when someone just said they had to do way too much domestic work as a child. On top of the cooking you are adding additional unpaid labor to her to-do list when you ask her to teach. Being parentified as a girl living in a patriarchal society is pretty traumatic and a lot of people replying to this thread clearly haven’t experienced it. :/ I think if op asks her to teach him to cook he should be providing something VERY good in exchange for it precisely because she doesn’t like doing it and has said it carries negative weight for her. Like others said, he could pay for the ingredients and do the grocery shopping + dishes. Op should also make it clear he wants to learn to do it so that he can take the load off and do it FOR her as WELL as enjoy that type of food himself. \n\nAnother thing to consider: maybe part of why it tastes so good to OP is because he feels nurtured when he eats food she made. He should ask himself if he could find other ways to feel nurtured by her which don’t involve her doing cooking for him.\n\nAt the end of the day you also need to respect if she draws a boundary and says no. End of discussion. There’s other great food out there and we are never entitled to anything from our partner.

I thought that because she was a mother of 4 (with two fathers) she was mature and stable. What it really was, is that she had an additional 15 years of experience on me. She was used to manipulating and enduring hard relationships she created, so the maturity I expected going in was actually bitterness instead. I got to be on the receiving end of that and I got through it pretty well all things considered. (She tried to convince me the be father #3 but I refused).  Regardless I didn’t deserve being put through the wringer at 25, trauma is real. I’ll take a more reasonable crash-out from someone my own age to someone older that is more skilled at detaching than crashing. \n\nTLDR- I dated 15 years older and got a crash-out 15 years beyond my comprehension.

I’ve known all of them for over a decade and we’ve never really discussed our dating lives with each other. I gather that’s normal for guys but idk. This to say, I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this. \n\nI tried going on Tinder. Not because I’m looking for anything, I really don’t want to jump right back into dating, but just to try and talk to someone to take my mind off it. I’m not the most attractive guy in the world, but I’d like to think I’m not hideous (¿). Likes are few and far between. When I do match with someone I try to send a fun message but no one ever messages back. \n\nI just feel really alone and lost. I’m 28 so I’m not young and I don’t exactly have a friend group to go out with to meet people. I know it’s not reasonable to think but I can’t help but feeling I’ll be alone for the rest of my life and that really scares me. \n\nI feel like I’ve had my head down my whole life either doing what I love or in recent years, work, but now I’ve picked it up and I’m looking around and realizing there’s no one there. \n\nNeeded to vent into the ether.
