Confront or bury?\n\nThis all happened a month or so ago, my wife's best friends husband let me know after a few beers. The wife had confided in her friend that basically she had a silly fling, cancelled it all and felt terribly guilty and remorseful. We otherwise have a happy healthy relationship, maybe after 10 years and 2 kids she needed some excitement?\n\nAnyway my question. Do I risk souring our dynamic by asking her about it? Or do I bury it and continue our normal lives\n\nMy issue with the later is every now and then I get a unfounded paranoia but I'm confident there is nothing going on. Will that feeling go or do I have to ask her? I don't want the guilt to hangover the relationship that one of us broke that trust and will be always living up to that.\n\nTLDR wife of 10 years cheated, ignore it or confront."

Accidental or motivated?\n\nI have been with my husband for four years, three weeks ago while we were looking at houses I brought up my cold feet towards having kids. I was met with silence and he left the room. This continued for a few days, he‚Äôd shut down anything I said about it. \n\nThen I was hit with all of it: I didn‚Äôt respect him, I‚Äôd be an amazing mother, im the problem with society, I‚Äôm the love of his life and I‚Äôm robbing the future because im coddled too much, I manipulated him by picking baby names. It was a lot and I didn‚Äôt know how to respond. So I just said that I‚Äôd think about it. Nothing more was said, this was three weeks ago but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs relevant\n\nYesterday we went to his friend‚Äôs house party. I remember having a fair bit to drink and falling asleep on the couch. He carried me to bed, I remember him telling me he loves me, and I remember sleeping with him. Prior to this night we‚Äôve always used condoms, but it was very apparent that he hadn‚Äôt used one when I woke up in the morning. \n\nHim and his friend were in the lounge room, my phone was flat, I wandered around for a while and then I started crying. \n\nI really can‚Äôt describe the atmosphere but it was like reality was bent. My husband was yelling at his friend to order me food while trying to comfort me, and somehow I was letting myself be comforted while I broke down in front of his friend while the Big Bang theory was playing on the TV. Then when the food came that I didn‚Äôt want or ask for he was frantically trying to shove chips in my mouth that I wasn‚Äôt eating and I just had a bunch of potato sitting in my mouth while I cried. Like all that was needed in this situation was a rapid chip force feeding. It was insanity. \n\nAt no point did EITHER of them ask what was wrong. They both defaulted to telling me that nothing was wrong. Then somehow I started to believe it. We didn‚Äôt leave until that afternoon, I didn‚Äôt get the morning after pill until today and I was told it was an accident.\n\nI fear I may be completely overreacting but it felt so easy to believe in the moment that he‚Äôd done something terrible especially with that conversation so fresh."

                "content": "My (28F) best friend (27M) has been lying to me for 7 years. I feel like I'm in some weird soap opera and have no clue how to end this.\n\nI'm struggling with figuring out how to start this, so I guess I'll just start with context. Obligatory apology for mobile and long post, I'll try to keep it semi brief but there's a lot. I, F28, have been friends with \"Blake\" 28M for about 10 years now. We met when I was traveling for a new job out of state, and I kid you not immediately became best friends in the week that I was there. Same interests, great energy and conversation, we just clicked. \n\nWe were friends for nearly 2 years before trying the dating thing. It lasted *3 months* (important), during which Blake did not treat me well due to unresolved issues from prior relationships. Before I could end it, he decided to end it himself as he had feelings for someone else. Fine with me, we were *clearly* better as friends. I took some space because he hadn't been treating me well, he got into therapy and apologized for being sh*tty, and was willing to put in the work to regain my trust for our friendship. Which he did, consistently, over the 8 years since.\n\nFast forward to now -- I'm now happily married to my wonderful husband Kam (28M, together for 6 years, married for ~2 years). Blake and I are still best friends; he and his ex after our brief dating stint broke up, and he is now with a wonderful woman \"Kaylie\" (21F) for almost 2 years now (started dating a few months before my wedding, this is important). Kaylie and I are also good friends, she's the sweetest person. Blake also lives in the same city as me now after his mother passed, having moved down here for a better support network; his girlfriend moved in about 9 months ago.\n\nIn the past 6 months or so, things have been strained with Blake. My husband is very introverted, and Blake started voicing frustration about his inability to be closer friends with Kam and feeling like he bothers Kam. He and I also started having weird tiffs (kind of subtle negs/belittling comments/etc). Then my husband and I came over to a game night for Blake's birthday 3 months ago, during which Blake picked fights with me about very weird things (for example my career path and how I'm going about it wrong, making comments like \"I guess if you want to stunt yourself in life, you can do it that way,\" etc). Both my Kam and I were caught very off guard, and after several attempts to shut it down, made excuses and headed home. \n\nLater, Blake proceeded to send me a text asking if I was okay bc the vibes felt off. To which I was like \"uh no kidding\", and explained my issue. He decided to reply with...an email (who uses email anymore???). 8 long paragraphs about how he felt he and his experience/knowledge was dismissed in our discussion, how he felt ganged up on when Kam would defend my side, and how he felt like he can't be himself around me and Kam anymore. He also made comments voicing that he didn't feel like he could trust me bc I tell Kam everything (not true, I always ask before sharing unless it's a danger or moral issue) and that he thinks I'm unhealthily codependent on Kam because whenever Blake and I hang out 1x1 I'm always calling to let Kam know how late I'll be out or check if I'm cool to pick up takeout (we're married with joint finances, sue me?).\n\nI replied trying to clarify my end as well as understand where the everloving hell this all was coming from, but no matter how many times I tried, we kept going in circles. The emailing back and forth, during which he demanded we not meet up till this was resolved, lasted till about 2 weeks ago, when I said I needed time to think about how to reply next. About a month ago I got into therapy bc it was seriously messing with my head and making me feel like I was a problem and like I couldn't talk to anyone about this bc we share much of our support system.\n\nI finally broke down to my sister when she came over to see why I hadn't been answering her (or really anyone, yay anxiety) lately. She is also friends with Blake through me. I let her read the emails, and she got pretty ticked on my behalf, and then proceeded to drop a helluva bombshell on me and Kam: *Blake is APPARENTLY \"still in love with me\" and hates Kam's guts.*\n\nApparently, when she drove to pick up Blake out of state for our wedding (he was a groomsman) he \"confided\" in her and her husband that he didn't agree with the wedding and wished I would break up with Kam and give him another chance. That we're soulmates and Kam isn't the one for me. Blake has heard me talk since day one about how happy Kam makes me and how safe and loved I feel with him. My sister shut it down, but, EVEN BETTER, Blake proceeded to do the same thing when she drove him *back home* after our wedding! He ended off saying he just needed some time, so my sister kept her mouth shut bc she knew that he's my best friend and hoped she could trust him to resolve it over time since he lived far away. \n\nBlake then moved near me about a year ago, and Kaylie moved in the August after. My husband's and my wedding anniversary is in October, and apparently Blake *called my sister's husband* to, AGAIN, confide that he's still in love with me and wishes I would divorce Kam bc he would be a better husband to me. While LIVING with Kaylie, who he's told me is his soulmate. This was about when all the stress started, so she never found a good moment to bring it up.\n\nAs if to ice the cake, Kaylie and I have been keeping up via text thru all this (again, we're friends). During the past few weeks, I learned some odd things:\n\n- Kaylie got new piercings, reportedly encouraged by Blake to do so bc \"she'd look so cute\": a double nose piercing and septum, which *possibly coincidentally* Blake took me to get as a post-wedding gift 2 years ago. \n\n- Blake apparently \"has beef with\" the month of August and so has decided their anniversary will be in *October*. The reason he gave was because \"it's spooky month\", but Kam and I started dating AND got married that month. I also, at my sister's prompt, went back and checked when Blake and I broke up -- August 2017. Again, *possibly coincidental*, but feels very odd as I don't know why else he would have an issue with that month.\n\nIt's also worth noting Blake had another relationship fall apart because the girl was outright convinced Blake was cheating on her with me to the point of blasting me for weeks as some homewrecker. Kam and I always chalked it up to her insecurity, but now I'm wondering if she was just watching Blake carry on some weird, one-sided emotional affair. I love my husband more than words can say, and he makes me happier than anyone I've ever met -- he's my ultimate best friend. Learning all this has made me feel so gross and like a horrible wife, though Kam has been wonderfully supportive and doesn't blame me at all.\n\nAll this to say, I'm ending our friendship, but have no clue how. I feel like I have to tell Kaylie as this has all happened during their relationship and living together and the woman deserves the world, but also recognize I have no real proof beyond spoken accounts besides the weird emails -- it sounds like some wild conspiracy theory or soap opera. My therapist is on vacation so I'm on my own after learning all this. I'm also realizing just how manipulative Blake has been for YEARS given this context, and already feel shaky about confronting him given my serious confrontation anxiety, which he knows about and could easily try to exploit. I'm realizing more and more that he has massive control issues that I dismissed as anxiety for years. The fact that he lives so close now fills me with dread rather than joy.\n\nI want to come out of this with no regrets, knowing I stood up for myself, and that I put a decisive end to this. I want Blake to know his actions and creepy ulterior motives are the reason our decade long friendship is dead. I've never ended a friendship myself (also a bit of an introvert), and this is basically friend-breakup on steroids. How do I break this lunacy to Kaylie in a way that sounds remotely believeable given the front Blake has built? I also would love some advice on how to go about telling Blake I know everything and we're absolutely done."

I say I'd like to take a trip for the weekend. He specifically asks if I want a bunch of people involved or if I want it to be just the two of us. I tell him, just the two of us. My birthday though, almost always falls on Mother's Day weekend and for the past couple of years we've gone out of town and missed the holiday for my mom. So I say, maybe we can go to celebrate my birthday either the weekend before or after so we can spend Mother's Day with mom. \n\nCool, no problem. I text my mom a couple days later who says she has to work and can't do anything anyways. So I let him know the weekend is free for whatever he wants to plan. \n\nSo today, he asks if I'd like to know where we're going for my bday. The conversation goes:\n\nHusband: Do you want to know where we're going for your birthday?\n\nMe: Yes, I can start planning my outfits\n\nHusband: We're going to Alabama!\n\nMe: Really? Alabama? What's in Alabama?\n\nHusband: It's right on the border of GA/TN near Chattanooga \n\n(My aunt and uncle live near Chattanooga)\n\nMe: We're not going to visit aunt and uncle are we? \n\nHusband: No\n\nMe: Did you tell them we're coming? \n\nHim: Yea\n\nMe: Awww man I just wanted it to be the two of us\n\nHim: Well then you're really not going to like what I'm about to say. Your mom, little sister, older sister and nephew are also coming. \n\nMe: (A little speechless because I think he must be kidding but disappointment growing in my voice) But I thought we were going away, just the two of us. \n\nThis then becomes an exchange of him telling me I'm ungrateful, how hard he worked to plan all this and that he thought I'd want to spend mothers day and my birthday all together as a family and me trying to explain my reaction based on prior conversations, my expectations being based on what we talked about previously  and truly being impressed that he could get my family together for this. \n\nWe hung up suddenly because he had to go. I felt bad, I could hear the hurt in his voice because he thought he was giving me what I wanted, but I just don't understand how when I thought I made it pretty clear. \n\nSo back to the questions up top. Would you be surprised at my reaction given the conversations prior? Am I ungrateful? Am I justified in being disappointed? How would you all have gone about plans with the conversations that were had?"

I‚Äôm unsure if I should proceed with the relationship under the ‚Äúrules‚Äù he‚Äôs been enforcing or if i can keep tolerating his weird opinions.\n\nOne of the biggest issues is that he asked me to cut off my boy best friend of over four years. (The only reason he asked me to do that though is because he found an album on my phone where I had saved a bunch of photos, videos, and messages from our chats, nothing inappropriate, just A LOT of memories, he got the wrong idea and felt uncomfortable, so he told me I had to at least stop talking to him.)\n\nAnother thing that really gets to me is that he doesn‚Äôt let me wear short skirts anymore, even if I wear safety shorts underneath. He said he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want me to look like a whore.‚Äù We also had a big argument over what swimsuit I should wear this summer. He‚Äôs obviouslu against bikinis, and even some swimdresses if they show cleavage or are too short. According to him, it‚Äôs not safe for me to get too much male attention, especially if I‚Äôm out alone. That idea has only come up more recently,I was ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to wear skirts for the first nine months of our relationship, but then he changed his mind after I broke his trust on multiple occasions, and if I hadn‚Äôt, then he wouldn‚Äôt have had to take that back or make such strict rules.\n\nHe also demands that I‚Äôm home before 8:30 p.m.\n I live in a city and have a one-hour ride home (using public transport). Most of the time i come back from a day with my friends sooner than he tells me to , and he said he felt disrespected that i always do the same mistake and that it was way too risky for me to travel that late by myself (we both have a bad experience with \"weird\" people in my city)\n\nHe checks my phone sometimes. he doesn‚Äôt read anything, but he did once ask me to show him the TikToks my friend was sending, because I sent him a video about some gym guy humbling another. It was a harmless (?) meme, but he still felt uncomfortable that she sent me a video of a shirtless guy and thought that maybe she sends me stuff like that often.\n\nHe also told me I can‚Äôt have any group of friends if there are males involved, and that I shouldn‚Äôt have any close friendly communication with guys at all.\n\nOn top of that, he regularly calls women ‚Äúwhores‚Äù online for posting gym pictures and even leaves comments under their videos. He has some really misogynistic opinions, and while he‚Äôs always ready with arguments to support them, its still not something im comfortable with.\n\nI want to also however mention the good side as well, he has told me that once we move in together, he‚Äôll take care of everything ‚Äî all expenses, supporting me through school, helping me, and making sure I have everything I need. And right now, he is very supportive in many ways. Our communication is usually really good, and I do enjoy being with him. But these rules and the controlling behavior are really putting me off, and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs something I can accept for the rest of my life.\n\nSShould i break up with him?"

It sounds like you care a lot about him, but these ‚Äúrules‚Äù are crossing into controlling territory‚Äîand that‚Äôs a red flag. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd think about:/n/n1. **Respect and Trust**/n/n   * Healthy relationships are built on mutual trust, not bans and policing./n   * If he truly trusted you, he wouldn‚Äôt demand you cut off lifelong friendships or constantly check up on you./n/n2. **Your Autonomy**/n/n   * You have the right to decide who you spend time with, what you wear, and when you come home./n   * If you feel your freedom slipping away, it‚Äôs a sign you‚Äôre losing yourself in this relationship./n/n3. **Double Standards and Misogyny**/n/n   * Calling other women ‚Äúwhores‚Äù and shaming you for the way you dress shows a lack of respect for women in general‚Äîincluding you./n   * That mindset doesn‚Äôt just disappear once you move in together; it often gets worse behind closed doors./n/n4. **His ‚ÄúProtection‚Äù vs. Control**/n/n   * It‚Äôs valid to worry about safety in your city‚Äîbut forbidding everything isn‚Äôt protection, it‚Äôs control./n   * If he truly cared, he‚Äôd help you find safe ways to get home (ride-share apps, travelling in groups) instead of setting curfews./n/n5. **Weighing the ‚ÄúGood‚Äù**/n/n   * Financial support and kindness are wonderful‚Äîbut they shouldn‚Äôt come at the cost of your independence and self-respect./n   * Ask yourself: Will you feel valued or suffocated in the long term?/n/n---/n/n**What you can do next**/n/n* **Have a heart-to-heart**: Tell him calmly how these rules make you feel. Real change only comes if he‚Äôs willing to listen and adjust./n* **Set clear boundaries**: If he can‚Äôt respect your friendships, your choices, or your body autonomy, that boundary might need to be ‚ÄúI‚Äôll walk away.‚Äù/n* **Lean on your support network**: Talk to friends or family you trust about what‚Äôs happening‚Äîthey can remind you what a healthy relationship looks like./n* **Consider your future**: A partner should lift you up, not tie you down. If you can‚Äôt imagine feeling free and respected, it might be time to break up./n/nAt the end of the day, you deserve someone who trusts you completely, respects your choices, and treats you as an equal. If he can‚Äôt meet you there, it‚Äôs not you‚Äîit‚Äôs the relationship. üíõ/n"
