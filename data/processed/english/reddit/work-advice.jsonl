When i came home last tuesday my mother surprised me with a vacation to some kind of holiday park, my grandparents are coming too. I got really excited since we don’t have a lot of money, and don’t go on holiday often. Now, my boss expects everyone who can’t come in to tell him 3 weeks in advance, except when you’re sick. I already found this a bit weird because at most stores you only need to tell them 2 weeks in advance, but that’s besides the point— Now like i said, my mother surprised me with it, and told me only one week in advance.\n\nI immediately sent my boss a text message saying that i couldn’t come in that day and explained the situation. He left me on delivered for a couple of days but came up to me today, because he had only then read my message.\n\nHe told me that he was annoyed with me since i told him on such short notice, now i would understand this if this was an actual well paying job, where i work all day, but no, i work 2 hours a day (can’t work longer on school days according to the law here) and make 5 euros an hour…. I told him i barely know anyone here and that the people i do know can’t cover my shift because they got school, and he told me that if that was the case i should just come into work that day, and miss my vacation.\n\nI kind of get his point, but im not the one who planned this, it was my mother, so how is it my fault? I can’t tell my mother what to do can i?\n\nI am seriously confused on what to do now, because i don’t want to miss our vacation tang my mother spent a lot of money on, but I don’t want to get fired either."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That sounds really stressful—you’ve been put in a no-win situation by your boss’s rigid policy and your mum’s surprise plan. Let’s break down some practical steps you can take:\n\n**1. Have a calm, face-to-face chat with your boss**\n\n- **Acknowledge his policy** (“I understand you need three weeks’ notice…”)\n\n- **Explain the exceptional circumstance** (“This was a one-off surprise from my mum; I found out only a week ago.”)\n\n- **Offer to help find coverage** (“I’ve asked my classmates and neighbours but they’re at school—would it help if I tried posting on our staff chat or offered to swap shifts later?”)\n\nEven if it feels awkward, most managers will soften if they see you taking responsibility and being solution-oriented.\n\n**2. Enlist your mum or another adult for backup**\n\nAt 16, your mum can step in to reassure your boss that:\n\n- This really was a genuine family emergency/surprise\n\n- You’ll make up any lost hours (e.g. extra weekend shifts after you return)\n\nSometimes hearing it from a parent makes it more “official.”\n\n**3. Propose a compromise**\n\nIf your boss still won’t budge, maybe you can:\n\n- **Work part of your shift** (e.g. cover one hour instead of two)\n\n- **Swap with a co-worker** for a future day you’re both free\n\n- **Do a small task remotely** (if any light prep work exists—stock-taking, simple data entry)\n\nShowing good faith can sometimes earn you a one-time exception.\n\n**4. Know your rights (but keep it simple)**\n\n- In many countries, a boss can’t legally fire a part-time teen without valid cause—but policies vary.\n\n- At worst, you’d lose a job that pays €5/hr—you can get another grocery or café job in a pinch.\n\n- If he threatens to fire you, you might let him (and then enjoy the holiday, worry less about a €5/hr gig you can replace later).\n\n**5. Decide what matters most**\n\n- **Family time now** vs. **a low-wage part-time job**\n\n- If this vacation happens once every few years, it may be worth risking a firing; you’ll bounce back, and your mum will appreciate your support.\n\n- If you really love the job, try harder on steps 1–3; but if he stays inflexible, choose the holiday—you don’t want to look back wishing you’d been with your family.\n\n**Final thought**\n\nAt 16, these jobs are stepping stones. Your boss’s 3-week rule is unusually strict, especially for a teen making €5/hr. Be honest, show good faith, and if he still refuses, enjoy your vacation guilt-free—you can always find another part-time shift when you get back.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you and your grandparents have a fantastic holiday! 😊"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Do you think I can get any help from the police?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The police won’t be able to enforce your boss’s time-off policy—this is a workplace/contract issue, not a criminal matter. Instead, you have a few more realistic avenues:\n\n1.  Talk to a parent or guardian about contacting your local **labour inspection** (sometimes called the Labour Board or Employment Standards Office).\n\n    - They can advise whether your employer’s “3 weeks’ notice” rule is allowable under youth-employment laws.\n\n    - If it isn’t, they can open a formal complaint, which often prompts the employer to negotiate.\n\n2.  Ask your mum to have a quick informal chat with your boss.\n\n    - As a minor, a parent’s involvement can carry more weight and may defuse the situation.\n\n3.  Seek advice from a **student-work or youth employment counsel** at your school or local community centre.\n\n    - They often offer free guidance on part-time work rights and can sometimes mediate.\n\n4.  If your boss does threaten to fire you unfairly, you could:\n\n    - Point them to the labour office and explain you’ll be filing a complaint.\n\n    - That threat alone often motivates employers to settle “amicably” rather than face an investigation.\n\nIn short, the police aren’t the right avenue—but your mum plus your country’s youth-labor authorities are. Good luck, and enjoy that well-deserved family break!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "nah an adult who is the jobprovider for a underage should know better and thread carefully. if not its a clear sign they put their wallet before worker rights and childhood labor rights.

At 16, most countries do allow part-time work, and working just two hours a day is well within the norm for teen jobs. If no official child-employment permits or hours are being exceeded, then strictly speaking no labour laws are being broken.\n\nThat said, even a mild dispute over a rigid “three-week notice” rule can feel stressful, especially when it risks a rare family vacation. My earlier suggestion to involve youth-employment authorities or ACAS was based on situations I’ve seen where over-zealous bosses treat teen workers like full-time adults—sorry if that came across as drawing on personal experience rather than sticking to general guidance!\n\nSo, balancing things practically:\n\n1.  **Treat it as a one-off exception**\n\n    - Acknowledge it’s not illegal—just unusual—and focus on a friendly appeal rather than a formal complaint.\n\n2.  **Lean on your mum’s support**\n\n    - As a minor, having a parent vouch for you can smooth things over without invoking outside authorities.\n\n3.  **Offer good-faith gestures**\n\n    - Propose swapping or covering extra hours after you return, or posting in your staff group for a shift swap.\n\n4.  **Decide what matters most**\n\n    - If it really is “not that serious,” and no laws are at stake, you can prioritise the holiday and chalk up this boss’s rule to a learning experience.\n\nIn short: you probably don’t need the police or labour board. A calm, solution-oriented chat—backed by your mum and a willingness to help make up the time—is likely all it takes. Enjoy your well-earned break! 😊"}, {"role": "user", "content": "imagine an adult telling a teenager that he doesnt have contingency cos he didn’t get 3week notice for a 2 hour gap.\n\nyou know who else uses this kind of argumentation in buisness? people who run scams.\n\n> Businesses still have to be run in an orderly fashion\n\nabsolutely that is why i originally asked if this was a school extracurricular activity. Surely 2 hours a day is not an integral part to running a buisness in an orderly fashion.\n\nAnd ok - ill play your game - lets say i’m projecting. If I am - and think on it, I am easily triggered by internships for multinationals (they tend to jump from intern to intern without ever intending to hire them and just use the cheaper labour and ease of legal issues.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You’re absolutely right—at the end of the day, it’s your boss’s business and his rules. If you don’t like them, you can always find another job. That said, here are a few tempered thoughts that acknowledge both sides:\n\n1.  **Policy Is Policy**\n\n    - Whether it’s a two-hour shift or ten, the principle is the same: if you break the notice rule, you risk termination.\n\n    - Making a one-off exception does open the door for everyone to expect the same leniency next time, and a manager may feel compelled to enforce consistency.\n\n2.  **Understanding the Stakes**\n\n    - You’re 16 and working a few hours a day—this grocery gig likely won’t make or break your future.\n\n    - It’s reasonable for OP to recognize that, by missing the notice period, he technically breached policy and therefore took on that risk.\n\n3.  **Why This Isn’t an Internship Issue**\n\n    - Unlike exploitative internship schemes that cycle through free labour, this is simply a teen’s part-time job at €5/hr.\n\n    - The dynamics—and stakes—are different. There’s no promise of career advancement here, just a straightforward employer-employee arrangement.\n\n4.  **Practical Takeaways**\n\n    - **Decide what you value**: a rare family holiday or a few extra euros this summer? You can’t have both if the boss won’t budge.\n\n    - **Own the mistake**: If you choose to stay, apologize for missing the notice, reinforce your commitment, and offer to swap or cover extra shifts later.\n\n    - **Move on if you must**: If he fires you, chalk it up as “his rules, his business,” and look for a manager who values flexibility for a teen worker.\n\nIn short: broken rules carry consequences, and it’s fully understandable for OP to be at risk of termination here. If a boss is unwilling to make even a small one-time exception, it might simply be time to find a workplace whose policies and people align better with real-world surprises—like a last-minute family holiday."}]}

I work in health care at an urgent care/doctors office while I’m in school. A few weeks ago while opening, I found religious pamphlets around the waiting room and bathroom that were different flavours but the same message: “You are a horrible person without god. You need to repent for your sins. If you don’t, you will die a fiery death in hell.”. Now that’s a synopsis, these readings went way more in depth and even had calls to actions and guilt trips, the whole nine yards. I confiscated them before patients got there, but I don’t know if they were there the evening before or who put them there.\n\nLast night, I found a book called “praying women” and on the cover in sharpie was “for the patients of {my practice}”. Left in the waiting room on the urgent care side. I found it by the end of the night and took it so that it wouldn’t be there for patients to read today.\n\nNow I have worked for another religious practice before and the religious harassment I faced (as I did not practice their religion, but another) was unreal. I would hate for a patient to come in and see this and think our staff or organization is trying to push this agenda when they are just trying to receive care. It would become a place where some people, especially those who have faced that type of harassment before, would then feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.\n\nMy predicament is do I tell my supervisors? Because it’s not like I know who the patient(s) is/are leaving them. And I guess there’s technically no rule against leaving things like that. And twice is a coincidence, if it happened a third time, then it would be a pattern. But I only work part-time, it could be happening other times.

They are technically designated men’s/woman’s rooms, but when one is occupied and you need to go, most people just use whichever is not occupied.\n\nThere is an older woman at work who cornered me in the parking lot the other day about my bathroom habits, basically telling me that she “had three babies” and pees a LOT and thinks that I spend too much time in the bathroom and that she’s going to start knocking when she has to go and I’m in there, blah blah blah. I do have stomach issues so when I’m in there I do usually need around 10ish minutes, so initially I thought the conversation was weird but I was like…ok I guess?? I don’t really know how to change my bathroom habits bc it’s not something I can control lol and there is also another bathroom she can always use if it’s a genuine emergency and she just needs to pee quick. She also made a big deal about wanting to do this “privately” and “not wanting to embarrass me” and just kept saying that over and over again in our conversation.\n\nI found out the next day that immediately following our conversation she went inside and was talking to multiple people about the conversation she had with me (so much for not wanting to embarrass me and trying to keep it private???) and had been making comments about “how much easier it is to get into the bathroom now” even though I literally haven’t changed my bathroom habits AT ALL since we spoke? And it seems like my bathroom trips have become a frequent subject of her general office talk. The same person who told me all of this (a close trusted friend) told me that she has notifications set up on her teams to monitor my activity and tell her when I am and am not active/in the bathroom. Mind you, our jobs NEVER intersect, we have absolutely no reason to ever message or even work with each other and she has zero authority over me, so she has absolutely no reason to monitor my teams activity to tell her when I’m active or not active so she can see when and how long I’m in the bathroom for.\n\nFor additional context, I’ve been at this company for almost four years and no one has ever said anything to me about the time I spend in the bathroom, and this woman has been here for six months and suddenly it’s an issue? I’m honestly just insanely mortified and violated and just like sick over this. I want to talk to HR but I can’t tell if I’m overreacting, even though it absolutely infuriates me to find out that this is something that this woman is actively monitoring and frequently brings up to other employees. I want to scream I’m so mad, but am I insane for feeling that way? I’m like, maybe I do take too long in the bathroom? But I literally can’t help it!! And there’s also another bathroom she could use!! So I genuinely don’t know what to do! She makes me so uncomfortable I just never want to speak to her again, and I want to go to her boss but based on what my friend is telling me it seems like her boss might kind of in on it too and that it’s become just this weird joke of sorts that I just haven’t been aware of for months. Ugh I just want her to know that I know and I want her to be as uncomfortable as I am. Would I be overreacting by saying something?\n\nEdit: an additional thing I’m worried about is outing my friend for telling me and ruining her relationship with this woman bc they have to work very closely with each other. Not to get into specifics, but even if I don’t explicitly say it was my friend who told me, it would be very obvious and there wouldn’t really be any question as to how or why I know all of this now. And since the only thing she really did to me was say something to me in the parking lot and then knock on the bathroom door the day after our conversation, all of the things I want to complain about (like monitoring my teams which I just think is so inappropriate) are things that I wouldn’t know unless my friend had told me.

I run in lock the door and start pooping. Not 2 mins pass and there is a knock on the door. However I have it locked. Still, I say… occupied because I know there is a spare key for the just in case the door is accidentally locked moments. The person walks away. I guess they didn’t hear me because the next thing I know I hear the key slide in and the handle turn I shout OCCUPIED. One of the two women in the department quickly closes the door and shouts… what are you doing in the women’s restroom you creep. She then runs off and tells my Process leader while another operator was in the room. It spreads to 4-5 other people and the process leader now tells me he has to report it. They say this will likely get me fired as it created a hostile work environment. I have a meeting with the higher ups in the morning I’m sure. My company is huge on respecting gender identity as it is part of a global network under the same name. I’m thinking about telling the HR lady that I am gender fluid but that I want to keep it a secret to keep my job. Idk this situation is so weird and complicated. What should I do.

Here’s a consolidated way to think about a 6-week notice clause versus the more typical 2-week standard:\n\n1.  **It Depends on What You Agreed To**\n\n    - **Written agreement wins:** If your offer letter, contract or employee handbook explicitly says “6 weeks’ notice for any schedule change,” that’s what you’ve legally signed up for.\n\n    - **No paperwork = more flexibility:** If the 6-week rule was only mentioned verbally, you have stronger grounds to negotiate.\n\n2.  **Statutory vs. Contractual Minimums**\n\n    - Many labour laws set a **minimum** notice (often the length of your pay period or 1–4 weeks) but allow employers and employees to agree to longer terms.\n\n    - If the statutory floor is lower than 6 weeks and your contract is silent, the higher statutory minimum applies—not a 6-week rule.\n\n3.  **Industry & Role Norms**\n\n    - **Resignations vs. schedule changes:** It’s common for departures (resignations) to carry longer notice—sometimes 4–12 weeks for senior roles—but far less so for part-time shift swaps or vacation requests.\n\n    - **Shift-based sectors** (retail, hospitality, healthcare) may ask for extra lead time (2–4 weeks) to reorganize rosters; 6 weeks is on the long end even there.\n\n4.  **Clarify What “Notice” Covers**\n\n    - Ask HR to define “schedule changes”:\n\n      - Permanent adjustment to your contracted hours?\n\n      - Planned vacation?\n\n      - One-off shift swaps?\n\n    - Most employers are willing to grant **exceptions** (e.g. emergencies, medical leave) with shorter notice.\n\n5.  **Most Jobs Use a 2-Week Standard**\n\n    - For a vast majority of roles—especially part-time or hourly work—a **2-week notice** for vacations or leaving is the norm.\n\n    - Longer clauses tend to apply only to managerial/executive departures or highly specialized roles.\n\n6.  **Negotiation Tips**\n\n    - **Propose tiers:**\n\n      - Planned vacations: 4 weeks’ notice\n\n      - Shift swaps or one-off days off: 1–2 weeks’ notice (or manager approval)\n\n    - Frame it as helping them maintain coverage while giving you reasonable flexibility.\n\n7.  **If It Remains a Deal-Breaker**\n\n    - Before signing, see if you can get a **written exception policy** for “reasonable” shorter-notice cases.\n\n    - If they insist on 6 weeks with no carve-outs and you can’t accommodate it, you may need to reconsider whether this role fits your needs.\n\n**Bottom line:** Longer notice periods often apply to resignations or senior roles, but for most part-time or non-managerial positions a **2-week notice** is far more common. A 6-week clause isn’t unheard of if contractually agreed, but it’s above the industry norm—so check what’s in writing, clarify the exact scope, and negotiate a tiered compromise if needed."}, {"role": "user", "content": "It’s a nurses aide job at a rehab center.

When you accept\n\n    - Frame your acceptance around enthusiasm and fit, not around “backup” reasons.\n\n    - e.g. “I’m thrilled to join your team and contribute to \\[unit/project\\]; thank you for the opportunity.”\n\n    - If you get a better offer later, you can handle that as a resignation—standard professional practice.\n\n6.  If a hometown offer arrives after you’ve accepted\n\n    - Be honest but respectful: thank them, explain you received an unexpected local opportunity that better aligns with your personal situation (commute, long-term goals, etc.), and offer to help with a smooth handover.\n\n**Key principle:** you don’t owe the first employer details about other interviews—just keep your options open, ask for reasonable time to decide, and negotiate around what matters most to you. Good luck! 😊"}]}

I hate making people mad/upset, so it’s a tough decision for me. I already accepted this job (job A), done fingerprinting, got a TB test, did a physical, but I recently “passed” an interview for a different job (job B), with much better pay and benefits. Although I haven’t technically received a job offer yet from job B, I want to plan ahead in case I have to take back my job offer from job A (obviously I would not decline the job offer at job A until I know for sure that I got job B). I also would be starting job A in about a week, so hopefully I hear back from job B by then. Sorry if this is confusing lol, I’m just stressed. Any advice will help!!!!\n\nEdited to add: obviously I know this would not be a good look which is why I’m asking for advice.\n\nEdited to also add: yes I meant decline/turn down a job offer, not rescind. That’s my bad."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It’s totally normal to feel torn—accepting one offer and then getting a better one can be stressful. Here’s a step-by-step way to handle it gracefully:\n\n**1. Wait for the official offer**\n\n- **Don’t make any moves until job B sends you a written offer.**\n\n- Once you have that in hand, you’ll know exactly what you’re comparing (salary, benefits, start date, etc.).\n\n**2. Review your commitment**\n\n- You’ve already completed onboarding for job A (fingerprinting, TB test, physical), so be mindful of any financial or contractual obligations—some employers may ask you to reimburse testing fees.\n\n- Check if you signed any agreements (non-compete, training repayment clauses, etc.).\n\n**3. Make your decision privately**\n\n- If job B’s offer is substantially better and aligns with your long-term goals, it’s okay to pivot.\n\n- Remind yourself: employers know people’s plans change, and most will respect your honesty if you handle it professionally.\n\n**4. Notify job A as soon as possible**\n\n- **Timing:** The sooner you let them know, the more time they have to fill your spot.\n\n- **Mode:** A brief, polite phone call followed by a concise email is best.\n\n- **Key elements to include:**\n\n  1.  **Gratitude:** “Thank you so much for the opportunity and for guiding me through the onboarding process.”\n\n  2.  **Regret:** “After much thought, I’ve decided to pursue another opportunity that is a closer fit for my career goals.”\n\n  3.  **Apology:** “I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.”\n\n  4.  **Transition offer:** “I’m happy to help in any way before my start date—please let me know.”\n\n**Sample email snippet:**\n\nDear \\[Hiring Manager Name\\],\n\nThank you again for offering me the \\[Job A Title\\] position and for all the support during onboarding. After careful consideration, I’ve accepted another role that aligns more closely with my long-term goals. I apologize for any inconvenience and would be glad to assist however I can as you search for my replacement.\n\nI truly appreciate your understanding.\n\nSincerely,  \n\\[Your Name\\]\n\n**5. Brace for mixed feelings—and be kind to yourself**\n\n- You may feel guilty; that’s normal. But making choices that further your career is part of professional growth.\n\n- Employers understand that circumstances change—handling it respectfully minimizes hard feelings.\n\n**6. Maintain the relationship**\n\n- Connect on LinkedIn or send a brief thank-you note later—keeping the door open is always smart.\n\n- You never know when your paths might cross again.\n\n**Bottom line:** It’s okay to turn down job A after accepting if you do it swiftly, honestly, and with gratitude. That approach keeps your reputation intact and minimizes hurt feelings—yep, even in a week’s time. Good luck! 😊"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I believe 2 week notice is for severance pay and polite notice to give the company to replace you.
