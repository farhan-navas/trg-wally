Family unit, bought house, car, have a relatively stable job, no major health issues. What more could someone want right?\n\nTurns out, even when you have everything you used to dream of, somehow your mind and heart can feel dissatisfied.\n\nRelationship with hubby has deteriorated after having my kid. Most of the time, it feels like we are roommates. Also, his capacity for engagement seems to have gone from bad to worse. Like he wasn‚Äôt the best conversationalist before this, but now it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs barely any effort apart from the daily routine conversations. He‚Äôs a hands on dad I guess, but I‚Äôm still the one who carries most of the mental load.\n\nHaving a helper seems like it could relieve my workload, but in reality I am just burdened by daily problems that she gives- always complaining about some leg ache, back ache, family problems. Sulking to do any extra work. It‚Äôs a nuisance. I really really wish I could somehow make do without one, but it seems impossible for now.\n\nI feel like I have no friends. Everyone is busy with their own lives and meetups are once every few months. Even calling to chat or replies to messages seem to take a a lot of effort. Whereas I see many others out there having huge gatherings every week. Why is it only me who lost everyone?\n\nThere are several other things that bother me, but it seems like I should just accept it.\n\nThe only time I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm drowning in the depths is when I‚Äôm with my kid who‚Äôs literally the light of my life. And perhaps when I‚Äôm at work cos I‚Äôm too busy and distracted to feel anything.\n\nI don‚Äôt know who to talk to about this so I‚Äôm posting here.\n\nEDIT: did not expect so many responses. Thank you to everyone, really appreciate the different perspectives. I‚Äôll respond individually as much as I can üôèüèº"

However im the husband here.\n\nMy kid is one of a kind level of difficult, and yes friends with kids around us says so too.\n\nMe and my wife fought so much ever since my kid came into our lives, my capacity of engagement drops to the point where i rather not talk. We do not even have a maid. I take care of chores, she settle the LO.\n\n1st question is, are you headstrong as well? Do you hear yourself talk and try to speak in a nicer tone?\n\nMost of our issues stems from being short fused, our snappy tones and the choice of words we use.\n\nDo not harp on minuscule things on parenting, it will eventually tire both you and your husband out. Coming thus far, a child is a child, as long as they are healthy they‚Äôre alright.\n\nI do not have friends, i do not spend time outside and i dedicate my free time being present, cause that‚Äôs the least i could for my wife and kid, but somehow my wife always feels that it isnt enough.\n\nWe do not have grandparents that could help us in taking care of our kid as well.\n\nI do understand that mothers usually bear more mental load as they care more about the gentle parenting side of things, but realistically there is only so much we can do.\n\nTry to go into a deeper convo about the issues with your husband to understand what he thinks and feel. Most times i‚Äôve seen are wives who are mad about every minuscule things that the husband do or say. Eventually this behaviour will tire husbands out. Be the wife that‚Äôs chill.\n\nBad news is, going out on a date with your husband will never feel the same anymore, and its ok. It is normal. Love isnt always butterflies, we just have to make things work.\n\nThe happy lovey dovey married couple you see outside? Either one of them doesnt have to work, do not have to fret about money, or they have grandparents who offer help to take the kids off their hands so they have free time.\n\nThose who are married and can still have huge gathering every other week? Either their kids are easy, or THEY themselves are easy and chill with their kids. Bottom line, every household situation is different, DO NOT compare your family to others."

You may also have after-school duties (e.g.¬†patrol canteen during lunchtime) in addition to CCA and even remedial/supplementary classes.\n\nSo while BY RIGHT, one should be able to knock off right after the end-of-day bell rings, it‚Äôs usually not the case.\n\nNot to forget you‚Äôll probably have marking to do/lesson prep (unless you‚Äôre not intending to do these like some teachers‚Ä¶).\n\nAnd then if some incident happened in your class, you‚Äôll need to follow up. Major ones, definitely need to call parents; super major ones, will need to write incident report as well.\n\nSchools don‚Äôt go by hours. So they don‚Äôt stipulate that you work, for example, 42 hours a week (it‚Äôs impossible anyway).\n\nIt‚Äôs common for teachers to bring work home + work at night + work on at least 0.5 days of the weekend. Not saying it‚Äôs impossible to not do so but you really need to draw the boundary and stick to it (and it‚Äôs difficult because teachers just have TOO MUCH to do).\n\nOn top of all those, teachers also plan and execute events (National Day, TDD, international friendship day etc.) and have to be part of different committees to carry out other roles (a lot of times barely related to teaching and learning).\n\nEdited to add on: this is for a primary school context.

Suddenly, the barriers I had put up in my mind were being torn down.

I started to do real good work, and people began to be impressed and start respecting me. It spurred me on to go on and on.

Even if you had provided your consent to your company to access your health data, your company will need to ensure that their processing is reasonable in the circumstances. It may be hard for your company to justify how their access to your health results is reasonable in the circumstances.\n\n> **Section 18 of the PDPA**: ‚ÄúAn organisation may collect, use or disclose personal data about an individual only for purposes ‚Äî (a) that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances; and (b) that the individual has been informed of under section 20, if applicable.‚Äù\n\nAdditionally, under the PDPA, an organisation must not, as a condition of providing a product or service, require an individual to consent to the processing of personal data about the individual beyond what is reasonable to provide the product or service to that individual. This means that if the healthcare company made it mandatory for you to consent to disclose your personal data to your company **before** you can qualify for the checkup, that consent may potentially not be valid because such disclosure is not reasonable.\n\n> **Section 14(2) of the PDPA**: ‚ÄúAn organisation must not ‚Äî (a) as a condition of providing a product or service, require an individual to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data about the individual beyond what is reasonable to provide the product or service to that individual‚Äù"
