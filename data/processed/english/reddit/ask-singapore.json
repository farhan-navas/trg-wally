Family unit, bought house, car, have a relatively stable job, no major health issues. What more could someone want right?\n\nTurns out, even when you have everything you used to dream of, somehow your mind and heart can feel dissatisfied.\n\nRelationship with hubby has deteriorated after having my kid. Most of the time, it feels like we are roommates. Also, his capacity for engagement seems to have gone from bad to worse. Like he wasn’t the best conversationalist before this, but now it’s like there’s barely any effort apart from the daily routine conversations. He’s a hands on dad I guess, but I’m still the one who carries most of the mental load.\n\nHaving a helper seems like it could relieve my workload, but in reality I am just burdened by daily problems that she gives- always complaining about some leg ache, back ache, family problems. Sulking to do any extra work. It’s a nuisance. I really really wish I could somehow make do without one, but it seems impossible for now.\n\nI feel like I have no friends. Everyone is busy with their own lives and meetups are once every few months. Even calling to chat or replies to messages seem to take a a lot of effort. Whereas I see many others out there having huge gatherings every week. Why is it only me who lost everyone?\n\nThere are several other things that bother me, but it seems like I should just accept it.\n\nThe only time I don’t feel like I’m drowning in the depths is when I’m with my kid who’s literally the light of my life. And perhaps when I’m at work cos I’m too busy and distracted to feel anything.\n\nI don’t know who to talk to about this so I’m posting here.\n\nEDIT: did not expect so many responses. Thank you to everyone, really appreciate the different perspectives. I’ll respond individually as much as I can 🙏🏼"

However im the husband here.\n\nMy kid is one of a kind level of difficult, and yes friends with kids around us says so too.\n\nMe and my wife fought so much ever since my kid came into our lives, my capacity of engagement drops to the point where i rather not talk. We do not even have a maid. I take care of chores, she settle the LO.\n\n1st question is, are you headstrong as well? Do you hear yourself talk and try to speak in a nicer tone?\n\nMost of our issues stems from being short fused, our snappy tones and the choice of words we use.\n\nDo not harp on minuscule things on parenting, it will eventually tire both you and your husband out. Coming thus far, a child is a child, as long as they are healthy they’re alright.\n\nI do not have friends, i do not spend time outside and i dedicate my free time being present, cause that’s the least i could for my wife and kid, but somehow my wife always feels that it isnt enough.\n\nWe do not have grandparents that could help us in taking care of our kid as well.\n\nI do understand that mothers usually bear more mental load as they care more about the gentle parenting side of things, but realistically there is only so much we can do.\n\nTry to go into a deeper convo about the issues with your husband to understand what he thinks and feel. Most times i’ve seen are wives who are mad about every minuscule things that the husband do or say. Eventually this behaviour will tire husbands out. Be the wife that’s chill.\n\nBad news is, going out on a date with your husband will never feel the same anymore, and its ok. It is normal. Love isnt always butterflies, we just have to make things work.\n\nThe happy lovey dovey married couple you see outside? Either one of them doesnt have to work, do not have to fret about money, or they have grandparents who offer help to take the kids off their hands so they have free time.\n\nThose who are married and can still have huge gathering every other week? Either their kids are easy, or THEY themselves are easy and chill with their kids. Bottom line, every household situation is different, DO NOT compare your family to others."

Treats me like an enemy when things get tough. It’s like when im physically present, she says im not really helping despite me settling chores and cleaning up everything else. I end work, fetch my kid, go for dinner, come back home, wash bottles, she put kids to bed, i do chores wash clothes keep clothes and she ends up falling asleep while i keep clothes hang clothes.

Waking up and going to work was a chore and had 0 work life balance. Work almost basically 5.5 days a week and working hours were 6.45am to almost 6pm, potentially ending later if there are more preparations needed or any extra curriculars to be planned. When I reach home, I’m so exhausted and can barely do anything else. Parents also love to contact after working hours and back then, my principal was adamant on us replying back to them or it seems like we do not care about the kids wellbeing. My health was on a decline, mentally and physically.\n\nI finally decided to leave the role and went to do a low paying office administration job. Struggled a little at first but I learned quick and went on to switch to HR Team at an MNC. Crazy enough, I love it so much, I love coming to office, I love working 8-5, I love my job and I love sitting at a desk with my ass glued to the chair typing away.

You would definitely have to be in school during official school hours (in fact earlier because of morning assembly and depending on your school, you might need to arrive even earlier for morning duty, like standing at the school gate etc.). Some teachers have their own kids so they request for late reporting, this is subject to P’s approval. You may also have after-school duties (e.g. patrol canteen during lunchtime) in addition to CCA and even remedial/supplementary classes.\n\nSo while BY RIGHT, one should be able to knock off right after the end-of-day bell rings, it’s usually not the case.\n\nNot to forget you’ll probably have marking to do/lesson prep (unless you’re not intending to do these like some teachers…).\n\nAnd then if some incident happened in your class, you’ll need to follow up. Major ones, definitely need to call parents; super major ones, will need to write incident report as well.\n\nSchools don’t go by hours. So they don’t stipulate that you work, for example, 42 hours a week (it’s impossible anyway).\n\nIt’s common for teachers to bring work home + work at night + work on at least 0.5 days of the weekend. Not saying it’s impossible to not do so but you really need to draw the boundary and stick to it (and it’s difficult because teachers just have TOO MUCH to do).\n\nOn top of all those, teachers also plan and execute events (National Day, TDD, international friendship day etc.) and have to be part of different committees to carry out other roles (a lot of times barely related to teaching and learning).\n\nEdited to add on: this is for a primary school context.

Does one have a good day’s rest or does one use that time to maybe prepare resources to cater better to their learner’s needs?

I thought coding was the ‘too much effort too little reward’ kind of work, overly complicated, and just not my thing. If I took a career test back then 100% it would show that tech was not for me. I always avoided it wherever i can, and didnt learn how to code at all.\n\nThen something happened and I had no choice but to fing another field, and tech was the ‘indemand’ one. So I thought I would swallow my pride and just learn coding a bit. Still hated it. But i wanted to at least get to a certain level of competence, so I practiced coding every single day, even as I hated it, for months.\n\nThat was until I started getting good at it. Suddenly, the barriers I had put up in my mind were being torn down. After practising so much, I realised, eh, actually its not as hard as I thought it would be. with practice, its actually not too bad. but i still didnt have passion for it, just found it more bearable.\n\nThe real passion started when I got confident enough to use my skills to deliver actual value. I started to do real good work, and people began to be impressed and start respecting me. It spurred me on to go on and on. Now, companies depend on me for critical production issues, and I get paid really well. The pay, respect, flexibility u get from the job helps you be really passionate and happy with what you do.\n\nso yeah i know long story but my point is that maybe to really like something you have spend quite a lot of time and effort into one sector first. you need to grind it out to a point where you start enjoying it."

This means that if the healthcare company made it mandatory for you to consent to disclose your personal data to your company **before** you can qualify for the checkup, that consent may potentially not be valid because such disclosure is not reasonable.\n\n> **Section 14(2) of the PDPA**: “An organisation must not — (a) as a condition of providing a product or service, require an individual to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data about the individual beyond what is reasonable to provide the product or service to that individual”"
