The loser is named the 'asshole', with the second-last player having varying titles including 'scum' or 'peasant'. The first- and second- placed players are usually known as the 'king' and 'queen' respectively (though other terms may also be used). At the start of the game, the 'asshole' must trade their two objectively highest-value cards over to the 'king' in exchange for their worst two, while the second-last-placed player gives their single best card in exchange for the 'queen's' worst one.While rules vary, in most rulesets, if the 'asshole' wins a round within the game, the ranking of all cards is reversed for the next round. This is known as a 'revolution'.In the West, a game with similar rules based on tai ti or some similar Chinese card game is known as \"President\" or \"Asshole\"; another similar game is known as \"Daifug\u014d\" in Japan.",

Alternatively, it may be made from two pieces of dough twisted and conjoined together at a point in the middle. As it puffs and splits open along this line or seam during the deep-frying process, it takes on a shape resembling a butterfly, and thus is commonly known as a butterfly fritter.

These were traditionally made out of two woven bamboo or rattan baskets, but can be made from any other suitable material such as a net stretched over a frame or plastic bottles. The trap must have holes small enough for water to flow through relatively unobstructed, yet through which fish of the desired size are unable to escape. When placed into a stream of running water, fish eventually swim into the conical entrance (sometimes attracted by bait) and are unable to find their way back out. The trap is set and then collected after a period of time.",

Some modern examples may use plastic feathers or a plastic base.It is similar in concept to keepie-uppies (using a shuttlecock instead of a football), and similarly can be played by passing the shuttlecock between multiple players while keeping it airborne.The game originated in the Han dynasty of ancient China, and is known as \u6bfd\u5b50, ji\u00e0n zi (\"little shuttlecock\") in Chinese.[1]",

The variation where a 'catcher' remains a 'catcher' after being 'caught' is specifically known as 'virus', instead of 'catching'.The game is often played by groups of children during recess or after school.It is known by 'tag', 'it', 'tick', and various other names in other English-speaking countries.",

The rice is fried in chicken fat, then cooked in the leftover stock from poaching the chicken, combined with spices like salt, garlic, and spring onion. This process imparts an incredibly rich flavour into the rice; it is said that in Singaporean chicken rice, the rice is arguably more important than the chicken itself.[1]Apart from the Hainanese \"white\" chicken, most stalls offer roast chicken and sometimes others variations like lemon chicken as alternative choices.The dish is usually served with the chicken sliced and either laid over a bowl's worth of the rice, or on a separate dish; the chicken pieces are drenched in a dressing of light soya sauce, chicken oil, and sesame oil. It is served with a bowl of the leftover stock, garnished with chopped spring onions.Singaporeans prefer to eat chicken rice with either a special chilli, sweet dark soya sauce, or ginger-garlic sauce. So crucial is the chilli that sometimes people judge chicken rice based on the taste of the chilli alone.It is arguably the most famous dish of Singapore. Similar 'chicken rice' dishes also exist across the Hainanese diaspora, especially in South-East Asia, such as in Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.",

Each player starts with one outstretched finger on each hand, and by striking any other hand with one of their hands, adds the striking hand's number of fingers to the stuck hand. A hand is eliminated when the number of fingers would equal or exceed 5. Various other rules are included, such as a \"clap\" or \"split\" where a player can \"revive\" their own previously-eliminated hand by clapping if their other hand has two or more fingers raised, thereby distributing the count across both hands in any way they desire.It is a mathematically solved game, meaning that any outcome can be achieved with perfect play.",

                "Definition": "a card game extremely popular in East Asia, played using a standard 52-card deck. In Singapore, the game typically may be played between 2-5 players, but the optimal number is four. The objective of the game is to be the first to get rid of all of one's cards, by depositing sequences of poker-like hands (such as ones, twos, five-card combinations, etc.) of increasing value in turn.The suits are ranked with Diamonds being the lowest, followed by Clubs, Hearts, then Spades. Within each suit, 2 is the highest card (hence the name of the game in English, \"Big Two\"), followed by the ace, then the cards in usual order. However, the ace and 2 may play the roles of the values 1 and 2 in certain situations, such as in a straight.To start, each player is dealt a hand made by dealing all the cards until the remainder is no longer divisible by the number of players. If there are any leftover cards, the players with the lowest-ranked cards (3 of diamonds, then 3 of clubs, etc.) take a corresponding card from the remainder, to give them an advantage in forming combinations.The player with the 3 of diamonds goes first, discarding the three of diamonds in some combination of 1, 2, or 5 cards. All players then have to make a play of higher value by discarding the same number of cards as the round started with in turn (with some rare exceptions, such as when a player has a \"dragon\" straight), or skip their turn if they are unable or unwilling to do so. Once play has gone a full round without anyone matching a player's play, they win that round and get to start a new round with any combination they please. The game may end when one player has discarded all their cards, or keep going until there is one loser left.While the game is popular throughout East and South-East Asia and within the diasporas of these regions, it originated somewhere in China, likely in Hong Kong.",

If the player whose hand is at the bottom of the stack wins a round of scissors-paper-stone, or there is only one other player left with a free hand but that player still has a hand in the stack, the bottommost player gets to remove their hand from the bottom (making the stack more technically a queue of hands) and keep playing.Once a player manages to free both hands while the others all have both hands in the stack, they can then begin counting down by saying 'Heart... A... ttack!', slapping a hand down upon the pile of hands on the last syllable.

Historically, the ball was then held in the hands and eaten before it melted. Due to reasons including hygiene concerns, it has largely been displaced in Singapore by ice kacang, which probably arose around the same time.[1] Still, it can still be found elsewhere in the region, such as in Malaysia (albeit served in bowls for hygiene).",
                "Example": "The vendor would shape the shavings into an ice ball using his bare hands, and make a depression in the ice ball with an index finger to make space for the fillings. \u2026\u00a0To save money, children would sometimes request the vendor to halve the ice ball for sharing. They would hold the ice ball in their hands and slurp it, leaving a sticky mess of melted ice and syrup and staining their clothes.",

Before tossing, it is topped with a variety of ingredients, each traditionally paired with an auspicious saying.

The fruits come in large bunches. The skin splits open along a longitudinal line when squeezed, while the centre of the fruit contains a single large black seed. This gives it the appearance of an eye, with the skin being the eyelids and the flesh and seed being the sclera and iris respectively. It is closely related to and resembles the longan, but its flesh is sweeter and firmer and its skin is warty instead of smooth.",

It is used in Singapore on a continuum with the acrolectal register of Singaporean English, across which the majority of speakers are able to code-switch.[1] Due to its lack of recognition on a national level, there is not much official government census data on the use of the language.

Singlish can express concepts, ideas and feelings that English cannot. Some things are not pretty; they can only be chio. Some things are not delicious\u2014they are just shiok. There are so many things that mean so much more in Singlish: they become richer, more complex, and closer to the truth. My voice is one of those things.

Some experienced diners may knock the marrow out without the aid of a straw.It originated in Indian Muslim cuisine \u2014 specifically invented in the 1950s or 1960s by either Baharudeen or Abdul Kadir, hawkers who wanted to find a use for the leftover mutton bones they had after making dishes such as sup kambing, which often still had a good amount of meat left on them.[1][2]",

Tossing the salad as high as possible while noisily shouting out auspicious greetings, and the big mess that often results, is considered a key part of the festivities.It consists of raw fish (in modern times, usually salmon), julienned vegetables such as carrot, turnip, and capsicum, and often the flesh of fruits such as pomelo or mandarin orange. Before tossing, it is topped with a variety of ingredients, each traditionally paired with an auspicious saying. This usually includes ground peanuts, sesame seeds, honey, sesame oil, pok chui crackers, plum sauce, and five spice powder.",
