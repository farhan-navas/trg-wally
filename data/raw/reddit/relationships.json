        "text": "Hello everyone - using a throwaway account to tell you about my situation.\n\nM33. I have been in a stable relationship with F32 for almost 10 years, 7 of which I have been living together and the last 3 of which I have been married.\n\nMy wife has never been the \u201cparty lead\u201d, she is introverted and rather closed off. However, with me she has always been outgoing and friendly, intelligent, we share the values of life. We have always been well and in good balance - after all, getting married means choosing yourselves, and we have done so.\n\nRecently, however, I had an epiphany: in the last 2-3 years I have almost no recollection of my wife being enthusiastic or laughing happily about anything. She is always anxious, depressed, sullen. She always comes home sad. She relies on me for everything. Every day there are problems and anxieties, and she tells me that I am the only positive thing in her life.\n\nShe has few friends, zero hobbies, she almost never wants to go out. Ever since I had this epiphany, I can't shake it off. I feel like for the past few years I have been on standby taking care of her, but since I realized this I can't do it anymore. I just can't do it anymore. Being alone is now almost a relief. I feel like there is no positivity in the house.\n\nWriting these things is very heavy, frankly I feel like crying. Writing them down makes them a little more real than in my head. I feel a lot of guilt in doing so.\n\nWe\u2019re also on the point of trying for a baby. I\u2019ve already told her I don\u2019t wanna live in a sad house. I wanna live with joy, especially with kids. Sharing this to collect your thoughts - has anybody been here before? What did you do?\n\nThanks\n\nTL,DR;\nSuddenly thinking my wife is not the person I wanna be together for the rest of my life. Guidande?",

The fact that OPs wife says that he's the only good thing in her life and it appears he wants to leave... Well I feel for her because my spouse has never tried to dump me when I'm at my worst. That doesn't mean OPs feelings aren't valid, my spouse struggled a lot when I was struggling, it's hard when your partner isn't at their best, it can be very lonely, but if OP is feeling this shitty I can only imagine how his wife feels.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPossible controversial opinion. I guess I could add that because of my mental health background I was able to reach out for help eventually vs someone not educated or perceptive might struggle and think that feeling horrible all the time is just normal.\u00a0",

It sounds like some where during \" living\" she started \"just existing\" \n\nFor me this happened when my husband and I bought our house, it meant making sacrifices to keep that house, it's meant working un fulfilling jobs and working endless hours to just pay a bill, it meant spending time together but none of it was quality time. I personally lost myself, I stopped having fun, I stopped going out because I was over worked and tired ALL the time. Then one day I said to my husband I could not remember the last time me and him laughed..a genuine laugh, one where we were hyper ventalating. I couldn't remember the last \"care free\" relaxing and fun day was. My life revolved around making sure the bills were paid and we were looked after. \n\nA few months ago I decided to go back to a career I loved, it meant working even more hours but they were hours I actually enjoyed. It also meant a little.extra money and that lifted some stress as well. I'm slowly finding myself again, and it has 100% improved my marriage\n\nYour wife sounds \"lost\" and sounds like she's just existing. Try talking to her and see if you can get any aspirations or goals or passions out of her. Stimulate her mentally and see if that can help her find her self again\n\nLove isn't lost, it's on a back burner tho, it can be saved!",

I went through a long stretch of really deep depression and sometimes I felt anger towards my partner because he seemed distant and sometimes held me at arms length. But now that I'm healthier, I am able to look at it through a different lens. I was a lot to deal with and he had no one to support him, or fill his cup. There was no room for him to have a bad day. I was not able to be supportive. So I feel for you. I do think it's worth talking to her about it, try to get to the root of what's going on, and get her help. But it's okay to feel tired. It's valid to feel sad and like the love has dimmed on your end because she's not filling your cup. If she's  completely depleted herself, she's probably not able to be good partner. Not on purpose, but when you're really down in the depths emotionally, you can't support yourself, let alone someone else. Do you have anyone to talk to? Being a constant caretaker takes a toll and not having the moments of joy and connection with your partner erodes your relationship. You need to make sure you're keeping yourself resourced as well, so maybe you should seek a counselor for her and for you. You're not a bad person for feeling this way. \n\nWhat do you think has changed for her in the last 3 years that has pushed her into the depression she's seemingly in now?",

You are seeking support and advice- and just because you are the 'strong' partner doesn't mean you are in the wrong. It isn't your wife's fault that she is depressed, but at a certain point something has to give. As the mentally unwell party, it is painful to hear that your depression is having a negative impact on your partner and your relationship. It can feel really unfair of them to add to your stress (speaking from experience) but it takes a lot of strength and courage from the 'well' partner to bring it up. No one wants to add to the burden. But ultimately, it did help push me to find a solution for myself because my partner basically told me that he loved me but couldn't live like that forever. Did it hurt? Yes. Did I initially feel a bit betrayed? Yes. But I'm actually really glad that he did because I didn't want to lose him or keep hurting him, and I also didn't want to live like that anymore. My job was the worst of it for me as well. For me, it was scary to leave even though I was miserable because the unknown is terrifying and the idea of being well wa so foreign, it didn't seem like it was possible. And even though I knew my job was killing me, I was also scared that if I left and I still felt that bad, where would that leave me? At least I could hold onto the hope that things could get better. But if I changed the last thing that I thought might be the problem, and it turned out that I was just broken, I thought I would have to just end everything instead. I'm really lucky that I have been able to find a stable and wonderful job that I love. But it did also take me time and effort to rewire my brain to stop being so negative. Is she willing to do the work emotionally to get better? Maybe simply quitting isn't the solution for her but finding a new job, and trying to discover some hobbies that she enjoys. My partner and I kind to get eachother experiences for birthdays, Christmas and anniversary- perhaps some sort of art or sport class might be good for her to try? Or for you to do together? Do you do things together for fun? Go on vacations or weekend trips ever? Date nights?\n\nWhat really helped my partner and I was after having about a week of long, difficult conversations about our relationship, what was working, what wasn't working, what we wanted, and a lot of unresolved issues that had piled up over the years, we went to a spa for a weekend- it was a splurge but worth it. It was sort of like a reset for our relationship. What we didn't realize was that we hadn't done anything like that in a long time. We were in a routine and a rut, and we had not been tending to our connection. And it is really important so do those things. But I recommend having the hard chats first. We dragged out all the skeletons, had a good cry, talked about the good things and why we wanted to keep trying and to be together.",

It isn\u2019t easy living in a home where you feel the weight of so much is on your shoulders. But please please please - please don\u2019t leave your wife. She sounds wonderful, but that there is something in her life that is significantly weighing her down. Please considering the following:\n\n\\- What did your living arrangements look like before you go married? Is she struggling to live with another person? Does she feel at home in her space? Did you two move away from an area that she was comfortable living in? Does she have her own space in your home?\n\n\\- Does she exercise? Coming from personal experience - If she is struggling with body image or not simply moving enough (less endorphins), that is like taking a non-stop express train to Depressionville. Take her on a little walk and pick her a flower :)\n\n\\- What does she do for work? For me personally, my work environment has drained the life, happiness, and soul out of me in the past. Does she feel like she has purpose in her work? \n\n\\- Are you two intimate? Frequently? If so, are you prioritizing her? Or are you just concerned with how you feel (respectfully)? \n\n\\- What is her love language? Spoil her with it! If it\u2019s physical touch, hug her likes she\u2018s a forking Costco-sized Squishmallow. \n\n\\- Have you continued dating? Do you set time aside each week where it\u2019s just the two of you spending time growing your relationship? Do you do any romantic gestures towards her (get her her favorite flowers, etc.)? \n\n\\- What hobbies was she interested in? What things does she like? It means so much when a partner can take interest in your interests. What does she do for HER? \n\n  \nShe may be struggling with any or all of these things but want to keep her struggles to herself as to not push you away. From what you described, it sounds like she\u2019s just a shell of what she was - she has no community, no personal interests, etc. It\u2019s hard to be there for others when you can\u2019t even be there for yourself. As hard as it is for you, you are the best and most consistent thing in her life. BUT - you are her husband, and you signed up for this, to stick by her side no matter what. She is your plant - water her, support her, help her grow. Look up the story of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and the concept of \"get her pink back\".",

I can actually relate to your situation, but from the other side. There was a time when I was the one relying too much on my boyfriend, expecting him to fill all the gaps where I wasn\u2019t loving myself. It took us almost breaking up for me to realize what I was doing. He felt drained, like he was carrying the weight of my happiness, and it got to the point where he started losing feelings. Hearing that from him was a huge wake up call.\n\nSo, I took a step back and did a lot of self-reflection. I started pushing myself to find hobbies, make friends, and build a life that wasn\u2019t just centered around him. It wasn\u2019t easy at first, those new friends didn\u2019t feel like \u201creal\u201d friends, and I still had to work on feeling okay on my own. But over time, it helped. The spark came back between us. Things aren\u2019t perfect, but they\u2019re better.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re feeling really burnt out right now, and I get it. It\u2019s exhausting to feel like you\u2019re the only one holding up the relationship. If you\u2019re carrying the emotional weight alone, it\u2019s not sustainable. I\u2019d suggest having a calm, honest conversation with her not out of frustration, but out of genuine concern for both of you. Let her know where you\u2019re at emotionally and how this dynamic is affecting you.\n\nSometimes, taking some space can be a good thing for her to rediscover who she is outside the relationship and for you to see if those feelings can reignite. You might feel like you\u2019ve lost the love you once had, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gone for good. Relationships take work, but it\u2019s got to be mutual.",

She needs someone to talk to about her worries problems anxieties etc. It's okay to vent to your partner sometimes but daily and constant negativity would be hard for anyone to take everyday. \n\nSecond, you need to communicate. Explain to your wife how heavy this is for you. She's relying on you for emotional regulation. Tell her that you need a break from this. You need emotional support too. She needs to see someone and figure out why she emotionally shut down. You're not her therapist.\n\nThird, I get why you're ready to throw in the towel because you're mentally exhausted, but at least address the issue openly, and give her an opportunity to fix it. It sounds like you've been picking up the slack and doing all the work without complaining for years and she has no clue you feel this way. \n\nThe title of your post says that you don't love your wife anymore. If that's the case, even if she does fix what's bothering you, it wouldn't matter, right? I think you need to decide that before you provide false hope, too.",

        "text": "Hey everyone\n\nI\u2019m looking to get a few things off my chest and get an outsiders perspective . This girl I was dating and had a genuine connection with really surprised me with something that I can\u2019t get out of my head. Originally the story starts when I saw a dating app on her phone after she told me it was deleted, things proceeded to a little bit of an awkward time, but I was not angry or yelling,  I was just questioning it, of course. This is also two days before my birthday when we were on a trip. the next day we returned to our cities and later that night, we decided to meet for a drink to celebrate my birthday.\n\nHere comes the big part. Almost immediately after singing happy birthday, she looked at me and told me that she was pregnant. She was quite drunk\u2026 so for the next few hours, we were taking care of her and went home. Eventually, she asked me to stay the night, which I would have anyway, anyways, considering the news. I remember saying I need to go to the bathroom and come back, and what followed was a couple punches to the face, slamming the door on my hands/face and many insults. At this point, I waited with one of her roommate for her to fall asleep and I ended up staying beside her.\n\nFast-forward to the next day, when I was asking if she will get another test done, then things like that, she had no recollection of what she told me. Only after a little bit, she included and said \u201c did I tell you I was pregnant?\u201d. She ended up taking a test and showing me it was negative, but I just can\u2019t understand this at all.\n\nLastly, for context, this is one week before I was moving to a different city. We were about to do long distance relationship as that was the last week together. fast-forward to now, we just broke up a few days before she was supposed to come see me and I booked all the flights and everything. \n\nTL;DR. She ended it now and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t want to come, but I guess my question is, why did it have to get to that point and has anyone else had an experience like that? I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t break up after that.\n\nI will appreciate any advice or comments!",

If you move choose the path that you know meets your long term goals, end relationships that won\u2019t move with you.",

        "post-author": "Time_Cheetah685",
        "text": "Over the past several years, since about 2019, my sister has been having strange behavior that could be symptoms of something like bipolar disorder or BPD.\n\nSome background, she had been living with my parents since Covid, who had been coddling her pretty hard. They gave her a job at their company, bought her a car, let her live there rent free. The way they coddled her was a bad idea and I told them that, she would have random screaming outbursts at my parents and would face no consequences for them, she even yelled at their employees at work and faced no punishment, she's basically been living like a bratty teen.\n\nLast summer she decided to move to my city to do a masters program, even though she hadn't finished her last masters program, my parents paid for this new program, and continued to let her work remotely for their company. I told them that while she needed to disentangle herself from them that this was a bad idea, I live in a very expensive trendy city in another country with my partner and we moved here for my partner's job, but we plan to leave in a year or 2.\n\nCurrently she's living in a crappy illegal studio in a bad part of town, she has no source of income beyond my parents company, but my parent's company hasn't been doing well since the recent economic downturn, and they may need to retire sooner than expected.\n\nYesterday I met up with her and she was behaving kinda manically, she said she feels like she's \"finally home\" in this city, that she feels a deep connection with the culture here, and that she's going to buy an apartment here. She's lived here for less than a year and doesn't speak the language, she doesn't have a work visa (she's still on a student visa) or the means to acquire one, and as far as I'm aware doesn't have much savings. Both me and my partner found her behavior concerning.\n\nHowever this problem is further confounded by my parents, when she brought up the apartment thing, they tried to convince me and my partner to buy an apartment with her. I told them that 1. We aren't looking to buy. 2. Any property we (me and my partner) buy would be for us to raise a family in. 3. My sister has no money and they can't afford to just buy her an apartment in an expensive city.\n\nI have told my parents that I think she has mental problems and needs to see a mental health professional, they agree but then they keep enabling her and don't encourage her to see one. I'm worried that one day my parents are going to die and she's going to end up homeless or be my responsibility. \n\nPotential symptoms she's had include: \n\n* Being paranoid that people are \"after\" our family and \"targeting us\".\n* getting extremely angry like switch has flipped, during these angry fits screaming and breaking things. One time she almost (intentionally maybe?) crashed the car while we were in it while she was in one of these fits.\n* Saying things that are simply not true, like that our father wasn't present during our childhood, our dad was a stay at home dad when we were little and was our main caretaker until highschool.\n* Poor impulse control, she has a big spending problem, like buying 200 dollars worth of cheap clothes on a whim type deal.\n* Grandiose thinking, this is a big one. She told us that she wants to turn my grandma's old house into a music studio? She's not a musician or a producer, I told her that she should first learn music production then and she flips out and tells me that I'm stifling her dreams. She has also frequently said things like \"I need to get rich so that I can save the world\". She often develops random non-nonsensical business ideas, one time she bought hundreds of keychains convinced that she was start a business selling them, these weren't collector items or anything, she didn't make them, they were just random cute keychains she bought, this seems to be tied to the poor impulse control.\n* She goes through almost delusional obsessions with certain lifestyles. Right now that obsession is focused on the city I live in and living a \"city girl life\". For awhile when she was living with my parents she was like this about cottagecore stuff and was convinced that she was going to buy a farm and live \"off the grid\".\n\nTLDR: My sister may have a mental illness and my parents behavior may be enabling it. Recently my sister has moved to my city/country on a whim and this has sort of made her my responsibility. \n\n  \n\n\n",

        "text": "F/18. my boyfriend M/20 follows over 8000 girls in tiktok. We have dated over a year and he keeps following new ones all the time. I have brought it up once before, like half a year ago. Back then it was 10000 girls! He said he didn\u2019t understand why it mattered, and he wouldn\u2019t care if I did the same. He basically shut down and didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Later he privated his following list. And unfollowed a bunch I guess. But I have noticed that he following goes up a bunch in just a few days at a time. And I know it\u2019s more girls. \n\nI notice this must sound super insecure and obsessive. But I just don\u2019t understand why he does this. It wasn\u2019t explicit models or anything. Just a bunch of regular, non influencer pretty girls. \nIt makes me feel unwanted and sad. I know I should bring it up to him again, but I don\u2019t know if I will get a response\n\nTL;DR: do you have any advice about how to bring up the problem that my boyfriend follows a bunch of random girls on TikTok?",

        "text": "Hi all, \n\nLong story short, my gf and I have been dating for two and a half years. She is 30 and im 26. We have never had a \u201cgood time\u201d in our relationship. In the beginning stages, I was still living with my homophobic family and in nursing school, I let her know it would not be easy and school is a priority, she agreed. However our relationship became so strained she asked me to move in, once I decided to tell my parents and move in, she said she would be scared to cheat on me and wanted to be honest. So we broke up This has happened three times, each time we got back together, i would get incredibly anxious she would do it again I would start fights and need to figure out if she would leave me again. each time we broke up, she would date someone new in a week. I have a huge abandonment wound from this and each time she asked for me back, I would hound her with questions, ask every other second if she loved me, and would accuse her of leaving me again. It caused so many fights. \n\nMost recently we have been together and it\u2019s been nothing but fights since December. I feel awful she broke last month and said she feels like a shell of a human, I told her we can still work past this. My brother just recently got diagnosed with cancer, so naturally I feel emotionally vulnerable, yet she has still stayed. It completely wiped away the past of her leaving me when I needed her most. But is now saying I drain her energy, she has no good memories to hold onto, and she wants to break up but has not officially decided yet and waiting to see if the feeling goes away. \n\nI feel the root of the problem was needing to know she would not abandon me again like previous times and she does truly care. I now know she does, how can I reverse it and not drain her energy. I love her more than anything and the pain of the past definitely took a toll on us. \n\nTLDR: my gf says I drain her energy but we just had a break through that broke the toxic cycle. How can we repair ? ",

        "post-author": "Any_Profile_4045",
        "text": "There are a lot of things which I don't like in my relationship and at this point, I feel like mostly I am tense, I as if got stuck in all these problems. Obviously, I want to feel relaxed (for now I am rather all tense), I want to have a nice relationship, but I don't know how to achieve that.\n\nI think I should describe what I don't like about my relationship:\n\n1. Our communication, ability to resolve conflicts most of the time sucks. Mostly I am the one who brings up issues and unfortunately, but for my boyfriend talking about issue is like doing a boring task which he does not want to do (he still does though, but sometimes it makes him annoyed and it annoys me that he is annoyed). But often instead of sticking to discussing an issue, we start discussing everything which is not productive at all. And often I feel like my boyfriend sees me as a person who wants to limit him (because, for example, I could be asking him not to talk while playing because it would disturb me). Also often I feel like my feelings are being dismissed because my boyfriend could start telling me that I am too fragile or sensitive only because he would not care about some sort of issue if he was in my position (and I've asked him many times not to do so and explained that it does not even help resolve any issues, only hurts my feelings). And I know that often my boyfriend feels like I am being pushy when I bring up issues because I might be repeating myself over and over which I do, because I am not sure that he understood me.\n\nOverall, it hardly ever feels like I am being understood, hardly ever we quickly resolve any conflicts even if it is something supposedly simple.\n\n2. We have a lot of differences which lead to frustration.  \nFor example, my boyfriend does not like being disturbed at all and his mood can change within seconds, so he might be in a good mood but when I approach him and disturb him all of a sudden he is all annoyed and it annoys me that he gets annoyed so easily. Because sure, I also don't like being disturbed or I might not be in a mood to interact with anybody, but unless I am extremely stressed, it would not annoy me, most of the time I only would get annoyed if I am being disturbed many times despite of me asking not to disturb me.\n\nAlso, most of the time, if something or someone annoyed me, I don't act annoyed towards anybody else. But if my boyfriend was playing and it made him annoyed, he often has annoyed tone with me as well which I don't like and it annoys me because I had nothing to do with his annoyance, yet he has annoyed tone towards me and might even get more easily annoyed with me.\n\nOr another difference is that I am definitely more proactive towards resolving issues while he is not. So if I see that there is an issue (can be issue in our relationship, can be something got broken and needs to be fixed, can be me struggling with something etc), I try to resolve it. While he might be too lazy to resolve anything.  \nIt even creates parent-child dynamic in our relationship because instead of him fixing his issue with forgetting to do some tasks, I end up being the one who has to remind him about those tasks. I was suggesting him to write down tasks, so he would not forget, but he told me that he would forget to look at that list...\n\nI am a quiet person who likes quietness. But my boyfriend almost every day has a need to make random noises, which can disturb me if I am doing something or I simply might find it annoying. Sure, if I am busy and ask him to stop because of that - he does, but if my only reasoning is that I don't like it and I want quietness for now (often I just wear earphones to block the sound but even then, I might still hear him) - then it can sometimes lead to a slight conflict before he maybe stops (like I get it, it is like I am limiting him).\n\n3. I can't rely on him with cooking when I feel bad.  \nWe both cook separately only for ourselves (most of the time) and if it happens that I feel bad, I can't ask him to cook for me. Once I asked him to simply mix spices, so it would make my cooking just a little bit easier, I was giving him clear instructions, but somehow he managed to add too much spices and those spices ended up being on the countertop which he did not notice and therefore he did not wipe that countertop after himself. So instead of getting an actual help, I had to wipe the countertop instead of mixing spices... Since then I haven't asked him to even a bit help me with cooking. I know that he is worried about failing that cooking and I am worried about the same, also it seems easier to cook myself than to ask him even if I feel very bad. I want to be able to rely on him though\n\nThe biggest issue is of course our issues with conflict resolution, but even those little difference contribute to me being dissatisfied with my relationship, often feeling as if my boyfriend is a kid.\n\nI think it could be beneficial if I little by little stopped acting like mom towards him, if I stopped being so controlling. But I would appreciate any other advices on how I could improve my relationship\n\nTL;DR: I don't like the way my relationship is right now and I would appreciate any advices on how I could improve the situation",

        "text": "I\u2019m 25F and I\u2019ve been engaged to my 25M fianc\u00e9 for the past 6 months. We were in a relationship in our early 20s, broke up, and then got reconnected through our families a few years later. We decided to give it another chance and eventually got engaged. While there\u2019s been an emotional connection, there\u2019s also been a recurring imbalance in how we show up for each other.\n\nOver the past year, I\u2019ve been managing fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, and recently got diagnosed with depression. Despite my health, I\u2019ve continued working full time and have done well in my career. He has been struggling after losing his job a few months ago. That said, the emotional distance and avoidance were present even before his job loss.\n\nThroughout our relationship, I\u2019ve made multiple efforts\u2014clearly expressing my needs, asking for couple therapy, and even traveling to see him despite serious health issues. He hasn\u2019t once visited me in the last 6 months.\n\nWhen I shared my depression diagnosis and said I\u2019d appreciate him checking in around my doctor appointments, he said I was \u201cacting like a kid.\u201d I stepped back briefly to process things, and in that time, his parents called me to say they wanted to end the engagement. He didn\u2019t contact me directly\u2014not even to check on my health.\n\nWhen I later called him out on how emotionally unavailable he\u2019d been, he lashed out, called me \u201cstupid,\u201d said I made everything about myself, and that I was emotionally too much. He also said he wanted a \u201csoft and peaceful\u201d partner and that I made him feel unsettled.\n\nI\u2019m not perfect\u2014I\u2019m emotional and I express what I feel. But I\u2019ve tried hard to make this relationship work. I know he\u2019s going through a hard time, and I don\u2019t want to disregard that. Still, the way he\u2019s handled my vulnerability and health challenges has left me wondering whether I feel emotionally safe in this relationship at all.\n\nI still care about him deeply. I wanted a life with him. But now I\u2019m stuck wondering:\n\t\u2022\tAm I being unreasonable in what I asked for?\n\t\u2022\tShould I wait and see if he comes back with genuine willingness to work on this?\n\t\u2022\tOr is this emotional pattern unlikely to ever change, no matter what I do?\n\nWould really appreciate any honest, kind, or even tough-love advice\u2014especially if you\u2019ve been through something like this.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nTL;DR:\n25F engaged for 6 months to 25M. Struggling with health and emotional needs while he\u2019s been distant and dismissive\u2014this has been a pattern even before he lost his job. After I shared my depression diagnosis, they want to break off the engagement, not him. He later lashed out, saying I\u2019m \u201ctoo emotional\u201d and not peaceful enough. I\u2019m starting to feel emotionally unsafe and unsure if this will ever work.",

He does not want to do that for you - this is a one way street. He's a soft little boy with mammy issues. You're supposed to be his bang maid and not complain. His family created a weak person and they are backing up the petulance. He judges you for having an illness rather than supporting you and admiring your resilience. This is the kind of person, man, who would leave you if you got cancer. He's useless. He thinks engagement is a gift to you. He will not be a good husband. Being alone is better than begging for affection from a selfish child.",
