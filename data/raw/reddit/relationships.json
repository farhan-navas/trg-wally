        "text": "Hey everyone, Im trying to get some outside perspective and maybe some similar stories to guide me on what the best course of action for me to take here is. \n\nI (31M) have been working at this company for the past 2.5 years, and for about 1.5 of those years I have been in very good friends with a coworker (29F). By very good friends I mean that we would chat each other constantly throughout the day, get lunch together and just generally share everything that was going on in our lives with each other. We are both single, and about a year ago I started having feelings for this woman. This I think was unavoidable. If you knew this woman you would understand. She is nerdy in an unapologetic way, so passionate about so many different subjects, you could spend hours just listening to her talk. She also has this quality where her passion is just contagious, and inspires you to be better at the things you are passionate about. She is also so witty and funny, capable of making you laugh without even trying. And if you by any chance make her laugh, you are in for such a treat, because her laugh just brightens up the room. \n\nAnyway, this created a problem for me, because I do like my job, it is high paying and stimulating, and I think I am fairly decent at it. Intra office romances are inherently a bad idea, especially if you are in the same department, literally only a couple of office chairs away from her, there are so many things that can go wrong, and then you not only lose your partner, but also make your work life incredibly awkward. so I tried to ignore my feelings and just be good friends. \n\nThere were times when I got excited and kind of hopeful that maybe she had the same feelings for me. She would call me outside of work, to just talk about random stuff. She would invite me for dinner at her place sometimes, or to go snowboarding. I would ask her out as well, but my success rate in this department was abysmally low, she would almost always say that she is sorry but that she is busy. So for the most part it was a purely office-bound relationship.\n\nNow, this went on for a long time like this. Until last week. When she told me that she had been seeing a guy for the past 2 months but broke it off, because she didn't feel it was right. This shook me to the core, firstly because we are fairly close and this was the first time I was hearing that she was actively dating, and second because it shattered the illusion that she could have potentially been into me. Nevertheless, this prompted me to confess to her what I had been feeling all along, because I now knew that if I didn't do this, I would regret it for the rest of my life, regardless of how bad of an idea I think dating your coworker is. \n\nI confessed, she rejected me, saying that she has a hardline rule of not dating coworkers. She was very nice about it and wrote me full texts afterwards explaining how much she appreciated the vulnerability and strength of character, and that she firmly wants to stay friends. \n\nThis is where I need advice. I want to stay friends too. Working my job is so much better because I have a best friend there to joke around with. And I am not a moody teenager who thinks that this is the end of my life. There will be other girls out there for me, even though right now it feels like there is no one else like her on this planet, I know this is not true. What can I do so that friendship remains, even though I still have feelings for her? \n\nTLDR I confessed to my office crush, and she rejected me, but says she still wants to be friends. What should I do?",

He has an English degree, reads a lot of literature, and is very creative in terms of storytelling and I truly believe he can write a good novel. \n\nThe problem is, he\u2019s overlooking good career opportunities in lieu of pursuing writing full time  when he\u2019s only maybe halfway through the first phase of writing his book. Right now he\u2019s a tech field agent and makes decent money (like 50k annually) but he also says often that he hates his job. His job offers a paid training program where he could learn more advanced technology stuff (I don\u2019t understand tech so I can\u2019t explain it better), but he says he doesn\u2019t want to do it because writing is his dream, not doing I.T. \n\nHe says that all the time he would spend on learning the new systems, which takes about a year, is time he could spend writing his novel. He says \u201clet\u2019s just wait until I write and publish this book, maybe it will do really well and I can finally quit my job and write full time!\u201d But I don\u2019t know if he knows that writing a book can take years to publish, and even then making decent money right off the bat is nearly impossible. \n\nWe don\u2019t want kids, but we do want to buy a house in the next few years and enjoy a comfortable life. Right now we live in low income apartments and we do alright, but can\u2019t afford all the things we wish we could. I just can\u2019t help but feel like he\u2019s setting himself and our future back by not taking the opportunity to make a better living in the mean time. I absolutely want to support his dreams and I want him to write, but also if he has the capability to move up in a field that pays well, I have a hard time seeing why he wouldn\u2019t want to do that now and put writing to the side a bit until we\u2019re financially more comfortable. \n\nHow do I talk to him about this without crushing his dreams? Or am I being an asshole for thinking he should consider a job he doesn\u2019t love over his passion? \n\nTLDR; boyfriend wants to make writing his career instead of taking a stable tech job, and I\u2019m conflicted about it ",

Building a career as a self-published author (which is sounds like he's looking to do, since he's treating publication as a given, not a possibility) is a marathon, not a sprint, and he's going to have to be SEVERAL books in before he knows if it's viable, not just one. That said, it's also not pie-in-the-sky unrealistic... at least not unless he's looking to publish lit fic with a traditional publishing house. That's kind of important info as far as feasibility. \n\nI wouldn't look at is as an either/or, and I'd encourage him not to do so, either. It's about determining the best split of time and energy that serves your needs and priorities right now. If the specific tech training course at his job is intense enough that he wouldn't be able to pursue his long-term goals, then it sounds like it's not a good idea. But there could be other, less intensive ways to upskill. Not wanting to take a specific opportunity isn't the same thing as quitting your job with nothing but a pen and a dream. \n\nHis 50k job plus your (similar?) income doesn't sound like it's your ideal, but it's also something you can both work on increasing over time. Him having creative goals doesn't change that, and, honestly, if he does find success his creative goals will just be supplementary income for a long time... not a big sudden jump. \n\nIf you want to make sure he's staying realistic about what a long, difficult road he's signing up for, you can direct him toward other author and writing communities.

Your job pays more with seniority, sure, but 50k is pretty much the floor for tech, too. The idea that he wouldn't be able to increase that substantially if he's not joining this specific training program now is not realistic. \n\nI don't think you should just shove your feelings down and shut up, but I also don't think the answer to your worries and uncertainties are to make your partner maximize possible future income at the cost of his goals. If you're actively uncomfortable financially right now, then you could maybe pick up a side-gig or something like that so that you're both contributing more equally. And then, yes, maybe have an outcome based conversation (here's what our financial goals are together and the timeline we both want to meet them) that doesn't specify what actions have to look like to get there.  \n\nIt might also help you (and maybe him, too) to do research about what the publishing process looks like, including market research, business logistics, and all that good stuff. If he's thinking he's going to be able to quit his job on one book, then he probably hasn't done much research on what this path will actually look like.

As a musician, I didn't really think about money at all, I worked temp jobs, and in between played music and did gigs, waiting for the next improvement or breakthrough.  My point is you can be totally supportive but ask him to be realistic, which is doing him a favor.\n\nTo solve the problem of being a bad partner with no ability to provide, I thought the responsible thing was to stay single.  That way, I was not screwing anyone but myself if it didn't work out.  So, I did have some success, which I treasure, but paid a price most wouldn't, and regretted sometimes, but not now.\n\nThere is the slow-burn writer, and the one that tries to make it big with one book.  Seems to me he could just write an hour every morning, write a page a day, and at the end of the year have a novel.  He would live a normal work life, and do classes to improve his job, but he would have to work extra hard and get up early to do his writing.  The discipline to do this every day is the kind of thing a serious person would need to do anyway.  If you need to quit everything just to write, are you really serious, or is this some type of escaping fantasy?  Do you really have the ability to write every day if you don't have a boss expecting something delivered at a specific time?\n\nYou might tell him he has a 1 year deadline at which point he needs to publish his book, and then he drops it for 2 years and improves his job skills.  Then he can get his book out, and get to work improving his job skills, and gets some perspective on how well his book can sell to get some perspective.\n\nWhat you don't want is for him to write a book, never finish, then start writing another one.  Five years later he's still writing but hasn't published anything.  You see, it's one thing to write a book, and another thing entirely to publish it for the world to see.  Plus, he may decide he doesn't even like being a writer.  There would be a lot more artists if it wasn't such a lonely endeavor.\n\nSome people might think if someone seriously wants to become a writer, then they quit their job, live in poverty until their savings have run out, and then publish what they have.  The success story is that the book is a best seller, and they are then beloved by adults and children alike who pre-pay for the next book.  Other people think that if he is serious, this can also mean he can do his writing while working his job, showing uncommon persistence and consistency despite what else is going on in his or her life.  Except it would take longer, and then only after he proved on paper he can financially make it as a business can he go full-time.\n\nNo one knows what the right decision really is.  However, I think creating deadlines for publishing can keep things tied to reality.  It took Malcom Lowry 11 years to write Under the Volcano (1947).  Can you handle it?",

He can still work his butt off on his writing. He can self-publish story collections or novels on Amazon to get an idea of how financially viable being an author will be. I have a friend who is now a full time, financially independent author that started out that way. Or he can be writing short stories and getting them published in literature magazines, working toward getting a story collection published as a book. But part time, until he's proven he can be financially successful at it. A lot of successful, well published authors still have day jobs. That's just the nature of the field.\n\nWriting and art are passion fields you do on the side until you are *already* making as much or more from them as you are at your full time job. Until you've finished your writing project and had a publisher sell it successfully you're an aspiring author, not a career author. At 30 he should have quite a few completed and published works in his name he's made good money with, not just a single novel he hasn't finished. If he hasn't made it by now, it's unlikely he'll get a big break all of a sudden if he switches from part time to full time writer.\n\nHe's the writing equivalent of a guy who thinks his weekend garage band will make it any day now so his girlfriend should let him quit his job and financially support the both of them indefinitely. The starving artist bit may sound noble, but not when you have a household to help support, or are in the process of making that happen. Responsibilities come first. Passion and dreams come second.

She is short tempered and gets mad whenever I have to do ANYTHING  that doesn't include her. This includes going out with family and friends. Every single time i go out with them, she constantly texts me and gets upset that I'm not with her. She's always scolding me about how I prioritize my family and friends over her, when I'm not trying to imply that.\n\nJust yesterday, I missed my niece's high school graduation because I was too scared to tell my girlfriend that we should postpone our date night. I feel like such a piece of shit because my niece always went to my graduations, and I couldn't even go out of fear that my girlfriend would get extremely mad. I'm just realizing now that she has full control of my actions, and I can only feel that resentment is going to start building up. \n\nHow should I address this to her? If I tell her that I missed my niece's graduation because of her, she will most likely get mad that I'm putting the blame on her.\n\nTldr My girlfriend has full control my actions.

This means taking extra time before responding to texts, and don\u2019t answer the phone. \n\nBecome less available for dates. \n\nHave conversations about the things you do that she doesn\u2019t like. Convince her you\u2019re not the right guy for her. \n\nIn time, (for him it took a few weeks) she will break up with you because it\u2019s not working out. \n\nThis will be your goal. Politely agree. Break contact completely. Block on all avenues. Heal, learn, find a better person who is not like her.",

It could be worth checking out Dr Ramini on YouTube, who has lots of videos about this kind of relationship dynamic and see if any of it feels familiar. I would also recommend reaching out to friends and family if you can for some support - not being allowed to see loved ones will make you isolated and this sort of situation needs external support.",

        "post-author": "WrestleTownAA",
        "text": "So back in elementary school, I was part of one of those rare classes where everyone was genuinely friends with everyone. It was such a good time. That\u2019s where I met Sarah, my very first crush. She was the queen of the class. Everyone liked her, but the whole class, kind of shipped her with this guy James. He was the golden boy, smart, good looking, confident, basically the most popular guy around. I was actually close friends with him too.\n\nEventually, I moved to a different school and lost touch with all of them. Years passed.\n\nOne day, I randomly ran into Sarah. We reconnected through social media, and it was like no time had passed. She told me that she and James had actually dated for a couple of years but broke up because he had loyalty issues. A little while later, Sarah and I started dating. We were close, and we even ended up choosing the same college for the first two years. Funny enough, James and a few of those childhood friends were there too.\n\nJames and I shared a few classes. There was always a bit of awkwardness, but we were cordial. After college, we all went our separate ways.\n\nNow, it's been over 8 years since Sarah and I started dating, and honestly, they've been the best 8 years of my life. We\u2019re in a long-distance relationship right now, but it\u2019s solid. She\u2019s been my biggest support system, and we plan on getting married in the next two years. I live abroad for now, but I\u2019m planning to move back soon.\n\nHere\u2019s where things get messy.\n\nThat old childhood group of 12 to 15 people is still super close. Like movie level childhood friend group close. They meet regularly, hang out with their partners, and James is still the center of attention.\n\nSarah, on the other hand, drifted away from them long before we reconnected. The reason she drifted was because, in her own words, the group never really matured beyond their school days. Most of them stuck to the same circles and never really explored friendships beyond that group. She wanted something different, something more meaningful and growth oriented. That had nothing to do with me, even though I sometimes irrationally worry it did. She\u2019s reassured me time and time again that she stepped away long before I came back into her life.\n\nShe has her own circles now and is genuinely happy in them. But she\u2019s still close with two or three people from the old group, and they hang out sometimes.\n\nThe issue is that these few people constantly bring up James to her. All the time. Even after eight years of us being together and them knowing full well how serious our relationship is.\n\nOne girl keeps mentioning how she has a crush on James and how he still hasn\u2019t moved on, like she\u2019s trying to spark some kind of drama. Another keeps telling Sarah that every time the group meets, she and James are the talk of the group and that everyone thinks they should get back together (indirectly tho). At a recent wedding, multiple people told her that James couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her. One of them even tried to convince her to go talk to him.\n\nEven the guy who was getting married, someone Sarah is really close with and trusts, joked that the wedding was basically a James and Sarah reunion. She\u2019s told them repeatedly over the years to stop this.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting.\n\nThere are so many instances I could list, but these are just the recent ones. And honestly, it really gets to me. Not because I don\u2019t trust Sarah. I do, completely. She\u2019s been nothing but loyal, loving, and supportive.\n\nIt hurts because I see her struggle with something I can't fix. She literally called me crying from her car after that wedding. She\u2019s frustrated too, but also conflicted, because these people have been in her life for a long time.\n\nTo make it worse, I sometimes feel like she left that childhood group because of me. She insists she drifted from them before we got together and that I had nothing to do with it. And she always reassures me that I\u2019m the love of her life, that she can\u2019t even imagine being with anyone else.\n\nShe constantly goes out of her way to show me how much she values me. She appreciates my emotional growth, my ambitions, and always supports me no matter what. She tells me often how proud she is of who I\u2019ve become and how she never imagined she\u2019d find someone like me.\n\nI\u2019ve worked hard on myself these past few years, personally, professionally, and physically. And I know with complete confidence that I\u2019m doing better in every aspect than the guys from that group, including James. Whether it\u2019s how I carry myself, my mindset, my work life, or even my appearance and social confidence, I\u2019ve grown a lot, and I say that without ego.\n\nStill, these situations mess with my head. I even ran into one of the guys from that group at a caf\u00e9 a while back. He was super nice in person, introduced me to his wife, asked about Sarah. He even regularly comments on my Instagram stories and posts when I share moments with Sarah, always being super polite and complimentary.\n\nBut then I found out he had been talking in the group chat later about how perfect James and Sarah would have been together. It\u2019s just so two faced. Like what\u2019s the point of being all friendly to my face and then going behind my back to root for her ex?\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019d never ask Sarah to cut off those two or three people because they are good friends to her in other ways. But this whole James situation just doesn\u2019t stop. I feel helpless. I can\u2019t talk to any of my guy friends about it, and I don\u2019t have many female friends I\u2019d be comfortable opening up to. So I\u2019m here.\n\nAm I overreacting? Is there something I or Sarah could be doing differently? She\u2019s done nothing wrong, and I trust her completely, but this situation really messes with me.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.\n\nTLDR:  \nI (M/25) have been in a serious 8-year relationship with my girlfriend (F/25), who used to be part of a very close childhood friend group that still regularly hangs out. Her ex, James, is still the center of that group, and despite our long-term relationship, a few of her old friends constantly bring him up and try to push the idea of them getting back together. Sarah has distanced herself from that group for years and is loving and loyal, but this repeated drama from a few persistent friends is hurting both of us. I trust her completely, but I\u2019m emotionally drained and unsure how to handle it.",

It's disrespectful to her first and foremost, but also to you and the relationship.\u00a0\n\n\nThen encourage her to set boundaries with them if she wants to continue to be around them.\n\n\nBut that's all you can do for her part of it. For your part, please keep stopping those negative thoughts and remind yourself that if she wanted to be with him she would. She continues to choose you and you need to honor that by continuing to work on your good self-esteem, because a lot of us struggle with it from time to time.

        "post-author": "TyMcCoy218",
        "text": "  I (32M) have been dating a lady we will call Alexus (35F) for about 2 months. Around November of last year, I started planning a solo trip for my next birthday. I ended a relationship last year and I realized that the past 2+ years had been pretty traumatic - losing 3 close family members, including my dad. Because I have been in nursing school *and* working full time, I feel like I have been going nonstop. So I decided to plan this trip as a way to be kind to myself, take a break from the obligations I have for others, and prioritize my own feelings and  to focus solely on the things that I want to explore. \n\nIn April, I met Alexus. Things have been going very well between us. We are both self sufficient adults who have traveled abroad for leisure multiple times. We are kind to each other and communicate well 95% of the time. However, we just can not seem to reach an agreement regarding the trip I planned. \n\nAlexus feels as though she is being excluded. She says that things have been going well between us and she would have expected me to invite her. She also says that because it is my birthday, it stings a bit more. She says that it feels like I am only considering my own feelings and that it isn't a good foundation for a relationship. \n\nThe other important part is that she does have some trauma related to past relationships when it comes to a partner traveling solo and cheating/lying, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, I recognize and even understand her disappointment. But, I do think it is well within my right to proceed with the plans I have had for several months - mostly because inviting Alexus would completely negate the purpose of the trip. She suggested - and I considered - inviting her on this trip and planning something smaller for my own getaway. But, that is the perfect illustration of why I need to take this trip to begin with. I ALWAYS end up sacrificing the things that I want in order to appease family, friends, and/or significant others. \n\nDoes this seem like an appropriate request from Alexus? And if not, how can I make it clear that this solo trip is about doing something for me and not excluding her? I am very interested in continuing to date her. I also want to be sure that I am considerate of  her trauma with the way I articulate my feelings. \n\nTL;DR: I have plans to travel abroad solo for my birthday. I have been dating a girl for \\~2 months. She feels it is unfair that I haven't/wouldn't alter the trip to include her in my plans.\n\nThanks All.\n\nEDIT: Just for additional context, I did change the destination of my trip AFTER we met. I\u2019m not sure if this changes anything.",

Please don't deprive yourself of it.\n\n\nFor context, I took the first trip after leaving a 7 year relationship that left me emotionally so empty and drained. My cPTSD also left me feeling like I need to take care of everyone and just be aware of everyone's feelings all the time. Travelling by myself was so soothing and wonderful and strange. I'm now in a relationship with someone but I think I will keep up a tradition of solo travel once a year. My bf was a bit sad that he couldn't join me on my trip but then he remembered how much good this travel does me and that we can take a different trip together at a different time.\n\n\nSorry for the rambling. I think relationships should enable us to more easily do the things that are good for us, that soothe and heal us and make us feel connected to life and joy, make us feel \"expansive\". It's ok for her to have feelings, but it's not ok for her to ask you to make yourself small. I personally don't want to be in a relationship anymore where I cannot \"exclude\" my partner from things. It sounds so harsh but I want some small parts of my life for myself. And I think that's healthy.",

But it never happened. \n\nAround six months in, his parents moved back into the apartment with him and noone knows we\u2019re together and obviously the circumstances are kinda weird so I moved back home. \n\nI didn\u2019t realize how little we text and call each other. My boyfriend\u2019s taking summer courses while working right now so naturally he\u2019s really busy so I don\u2019t want to take away from his work or school. \n\nBut I take a step back and look at our messages and it\u2019s literally just me telling him about my day and his little dry responses and that\u2019s it. \n\nI see him once a week for maybe 3 hours max now. Sometimes we play games together. I\u2019m not sure if this is the type of relationship I can handle. \n\nCouple years ago I got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and kind of brushed it off and didn\u2019t tell anyone, not even my boyfriend. \n\nNow that I\u2019m in an actual relationship though, all those sessions about my unhealthy attachment issues finally make sense. \n\nI go crazy knowing he\u2019s not coming home to me yk and not talking to him about my day and hearing his struggles at work or whatever is lowkey affecting me a lot more than I thought. \n\nLike I\u2019d somehow convinced myself that he doesn\u2019t want me anymore so that I can move on. And we havent even broken up or anything \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d \n\nI\u2019m just convinced that he shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship with someone who needs attention like me, and that he should just focus on school and work. \n\nI don\u2019t know it\u2019s just been really hard. Should I just break up with him or like how do I cope. Like I genuinely feel ill.\n\nTLDR: I was living with my man for six months and recently moved out. I\u2019m going crazy cuz we dont really text or call and I see him once a week (maybe once in two weeks). He\u2019s really busy so I get it but if giving me the attention I want is too much, maybe we arent so good together. I don\u2019t know.",

        "text": "I am not the type to usually turn to an internet forum for advice, but I'm genuinely the biggest emotional wreck I have been, in the short life I have lived thus far.\n\nI (18F), and my boyfriend (18M) have been dating for 3.5 months. Prior to relationship, we were best friends, and did everything together. I would say that our relationship was better than we actually started dating. And then, one day he asked me out on facetime at like 3am, and me being madly in love with him, said yes.\n\nHe insisted our relationship remain secret, because he wanted to take time to 'figure things out' between us, and not have any meddling from the people around us at school, which makes sense, because of a lot of nosy friends we have. Plus, we just finished junior year, and it made sense to focus a little more on school right before college applications.\n\nBut, here is the issue: we haven't done\u00a0*anything.*\u00a0It's almost been 4 months. No good morning/goodnight texts, no dates, nothing affectionate, no compliments, TBH it feels like our friendship was more affectionate. Every time I bring up that we should tell our friends, he's always 'busy' and pushes it back. Lately, he's stopped calling me too. He slips in rude remarks towards me at times, is friends with my ex-best friend who he knows I was personally hurt by a lot, and when we talk, it just seems like he's not interested.\n\nI honestly just want my best friend back. I want a relationship that's\u00a0*good,*\u00a0not whatever this is. I ask to 'hangout' because he doesn't wanna go on dates, and he can't even make time for that.\n\nThe advice I am looking for:\n\n* Is breaking up the wisest decision?\n* How do I tell him that I want an\u00a0*actual*\u00a0relationship? I'm so bad at communicating and I want to get it across that I don't want to waste my time in something that is barely dating.\n\nTL;DR -\u00a0**female high school senior upset her boyfriend is not showing affection/putting effort in relationship, doesn't know how to communicate that to him.**",

        "post-author": "TheRiddickles",
        "text": "My brother and I both lived away from the city we grew up in when we were in our early 20s.  I was working out of state and he was in the military.\n\nWhen I moved back home in 2018 I bought a condo.  He was living on his own with some assistance from our parents while he was going to school using his GI bill after he got out of the military.\n\nSince I had an extra room in my condo I told him he could live with me and pay a pretty low rent.  We're in a high COL area and I don't ask him for much.  He just pays me every month and I take care of my mortgage, all our utilities, internet, etc. What he's paying is roughly half of what it would cost him to live on his own with a regular roomate somewhere in our city.  It's nice to have some extra money towards the mortgage and at first it was cool to help him out while he was finishing school.\n\nWell, he got his degree in 2020, and had talked about grad school.  5 years later he's still not in school and still hasn't had a job since he got out of the military almost ten years ago.  I'm pretty sure he's depressed and I know he has some health issues.  He's a combat vet and is deaf in one ear.  He also has some kind of diet restrictions.  He won't really give anyone any details but I know his stomach and throat bother him.  He gets some kind of disability from his time in service I'm pretty sure.  Again he doesn't really tell anyone.\n\nWhen I ask him why he hasn't started looking for a job it's \"health issues\".  The thing is he still goes out with friends sometimes, does his own grocery shopping, goes to the gym almost daily,  and other active things. \n\nIt's not about the money, I do fine financially and I've always been happy to help him out..but this was never supposed to be a permanent situation.  It's frustrating that he's almost ALWAYS home.  He also keeps weird hours and is up ALL night every night and sleeps in the day.  Makes it extra annoying since I work all day while he sleeps..then he's up when I'm home for the evening.  I work really hard and never have my condo to myself and when friends and family ask what my brother is doing I really don't know what to say anymore..he's in his mid 30's now and I really don't have an answer.  I've told him several times over the last year that he needs to start looking for work..it's going to look worse and worse to employers that he just has this massive unemployment gap, it's not healthy, etc. \n\nI've brought it up to my parents but they're getting older and I really don't want to make this their problem.  I know they're worried about him.  A couple months ago I even spent a day making a resume for him and showing him some local jobs he might like.  Even told him a friend is a supervisor at Costco and if he just wants SOMETHING to do for now I could put in a word for him.\n\nWhen I tell him he really needs to get a job and get busy in life he's basically saying \"Why do you care?\".\n\nI don't know if I need to tell him to get a job or move out..or if I'm overreacting here.  Is there something else I could do to help?\n\nTL;DR Brother is in his mid 30s and living with me.  He contributes somewhat but I'm afraid I'm enabling him to just be content doing nothing.  Driving me a bit crazy that I never have my own place to myself and running out of answers when friends and family ask what he's doing with his life.",

                "body": "You\u2019re not overreacting, you\u2019re being extremely generous and patient, and your frustration is valid. It sounds like you\u2019ve done more than most would in your position. What\u2019s clear is that this situation isn\u2019t sustainable for your mental well-being, your relationship with your brother, or his personal growth. I suggest saying: \u201cI want to talk to you about something important. I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a while because I care about you and your well-being, but I also have to be honest about how things are affecting me. When you moved in, the idea was that it would be temporary while you figured out your next steps. I know you\u2019ve been through a lot, and I don\u2019t want to minimize your health issues or your service. But it\u2019s been five years, and I\u2019m worried that staying in this limbo is actually hurting you more than helping. I\u2019ve tried to help, we worked on a resume, I mentioned some jobs, and I know you\u2019ve got some disability support. But the reality is, living like this indefinitely isn\u2019t healthy for either of us. I\u2019m working full-time, I don\u2019t get much space to myself, and I feel like I\u2019m enabling you to stay stuck and I don\u2019t want that for you. So here\u2019s where I\u2019m at.. I think it\u2019s time to make a change. We need to set a clear timeline for when you either start working toward a job, school, or some kind of meaningful structure in your life or start making plans to move out. I\u2019m not kicking you out tomorrow, but I need to see effort and progress, and I\u2019m happy to support you in that if you\u2019re willing to engage. This isn\u2019t about money or being harsh, it\u2019s about both of us having lives that move forward. You deserve more than being stuck in neutral. But I can\u2019t carry that for you.\u201d\n\nThis could work because it\u2019s direct but compassionate, it keeps the focus on concern, not blame, it gives him agency, but also consequences, it clearly sets a timeline or expectation shift; which is what\u2019s missing now. Pick a firm but reasonable deadline; maybe 3-6 months for either employment, school, or independent living. Let him know ahead of time and stop doing the work for him, you already helped with resumes and lead so if he doesn\u2019t act, that\u2019s his choice. You should also prepare emotionally for pushback he may get defensive, guilt-trip, or withdraw. Stay calm. Repeat your message: \u201cI care, but I can\u2019t enable this anymore. Most importantly, get support. You\u2019re carrying a lot. Even talking to a therapist or counselor for you could help reinforce your boundaries and give you strength. This isn\u2019t about making him feel bad, it\u2019s about recognizing that being stuck isn\u2019t safe or sustainable. You\u2019re not just protecting yourself, you\u2019re nudging him toward responsibility, which is ultimately what he needs most.",

Maybe to help soften it a little and show him you\u2019re not pushing him off a cliff you could add \u201cAlso just to be clear I\u2019m not expecting you to have everything figured out overnight. I know the idea of jumping into full-time work or making big changes can be a lot. But I do think it\u2019s important to start somewhere, even small. A part-time job, volunteering, talking to a therapist, or just getting into a routine. Something to break the stagnation and move toward independence. I\u2019m still in your corner. I just need us both to be moving forward, even if it\u2019s step by step.\u201d\nThis lets him know that you\u2019re not measuring success by him landing a high-paying job tomorrow, you\u2019re measuring it by effort and momentum.

We have good communication, I know he loves me dearly and I love him back insanely and I really want my future with him. \n\n\nI knew he had ex\u2019s that\u2019s fine, I\u2019ve had some too so not a biggie. The last one however makes me a bit uncomfortable. This ex 22F, They broke up on seemingly good terms and I know they talk every now and again. He mentioned to me once a while back that she tried flirting with him when they were talking once and he said he shut it down, no worries, I trust him. Then we were doing something on his phone a good while later (maybe 2-3 months) and her text notification popped up and when I looked at him he said she\u2019d apologised and that if I\u2019d like, he\u2019d block her. I kinda just brushed it off but it made me a bit uncomfortable. \n\n\nThen, I saw his camera roll (with him showing pics) and saw that he still had some pics with her and I asked him to delete him, which as of now he has not and it\u2019s been a while. Then he mentioned just recently how they don\u2019t really talk anymore because she kept trying to flirt and initiate things. I haven\u2019t gone through his phone and I really honestly do trust him. I\u2019m not super worried that he\u2019s cheating but she just makes me really uncomfortable because to me it shows she doesn\u2019t respect our relationship and she clearly still wants something with him. \n\n\nSo how do I bring it up to him that I want him to block her? It just feels really controlling but it is a boundary of mine and I\u2019m honesty not an insecure person it\u2019s just that I know she\u2019s trying to get with him if that makes sense. I know he\u2019s not out here cheating or anything but I do know he can be a bit oblivious, and he\u2019s friendly with his other ex\u2019s but it\u2019s just this one that makes me feel this way. \nTL;DR my bfs ex makes me uncomfy and I don\u2019t know how to go about the situation best\n",

In this case, he has already distanced himself from her because he sees the same problems you do, and he's already offered to block her. Just bring that up and ask if he would still consider that offer valid. Explain that at the time you had mixed feelings but XYZ has happened since then. You are uncomfortable because she has repeatedly tried to flirt and initiate things. Ultimately it's his choice to block but I suspect once you express your discomfort to him he'll be on the same page.\u00a0",

She introduced me to him. \n\nNow the other day my boyfriend\u2019s best friend tells me my man used to be IN LOVE with my best friend, like in love. Now I just feel disgusted. I always felt like he still had something towards her. He\u2019s always so happy when she\u2019s around.\n\nFor example, we all went to a concert yesterday. I brought up a conversation about knowing someone and he kinda snapped at me saying \u201cI don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking about\u201d whatever, but when he talks to her it\u2019s just different. He\u2019s positive and makes conversation. I even caught him looking at her during the concert. He\u2019s never really affectionate with me around her either.\n\nI honestly want to talk to him but at the same time I don\u2019t know if I can handle this information and still be in a relationship. I feel crazy. I genuinely don\u2019t know what to do. I cry everyday because I feel like he\u2019d rather be with her. I feel so sad.

When we met I was in a very manic and in an unhinged state of mind where I was pursuing any kind of male attention I could find from men I found attractive. This may be coincidental, or not, I REALLY DONT KNOW, but it was right after I broke up with my last girlfriend that I met him. I think I was pretty heartbroken and extremely mentally ill at the time and wanting validation so we had sex like 3-5 times a day for like 2 years of us being together. \n\nAfter we moved in together in another city (away from friends and family) so I could finish school, I was much more mentally stable, (probably more depressed but stable) sex has declined severely since then. It\u2019s now about twice a month at the max. I dread having sex with him now and I feel no sexual desire towards literally anyone at all, whether it be a rando hottie on the street, kristen stewart, or timothee chalamet. just nothing. I know he wants to have sex more, and I feel guilty because we started off a certain way. but it feels like I have to force myself to want to have sex with him now, like to the point I just close my eyes and put my best act on until it\u2019s over. and he gets annoyed if I don\u2019t do it often enough and am not enthusiastic enough. which I get because 1-2 times a month is crazy for a 23 yr old. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. we have problems in our relationship so is that just killing any feelings I have towards him or am I just discovering asexuality or something?? I can give more context if needed, I am just lost as to why i\u2019m feeling this way.\n\nTldr: I am confused if my relationship or my sexuality is causing me to not want to have sex with my boyfriend. ever. literally ever. It wasn\u2019t always like this, but now my aversion to sex with him never lets up, and when I do have to have sex with him, it makes me sick and be in physical pain. ",

        "post-author": "Full-Energy-6432",
        "text": "I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for about a year, and I need help understanding a critical difference between us. To make a long story short, my boyfriend has a really bad habit of overcomplicating things. I think this stems from a sense of perfectionism, but it's exhausting because it makes simple tasks extremely time consuming and, because it's so time consuming, he often procrastinates and doesn't do the things he's supposed to. \n\nFor instance, he won't make/eat breakfast unless I'm with him because it takes too long (he claims it would take him an hour to make a smoothie and I'm just like...how on fucking earth does it take you an hour to make a smoothie?) and the thing is, I've seen him in action. Cooking even the most basic meal takes 3+ hours because of the all the crazy detail he puts into it (and, for the record, it always tastes like a normal meal -- he's a good cook, but the stuff he's making does not require the time he's putting into it). \n\nI don't want to critique him on this, because it seems like it's an aspect of his personality, but it's staring to get really frustrating. When I try to help or offer suggestions for how to simplify things, he just brushes them off. This is fine, but I can see how discouraged he gets and how he will go into freeze mode and just not do anything because of how overwhelmed he is by how intensive something is going to be. But he's the one making it that way? Am I making any sense? This applies across all areas of his life except, as far as I can tell, his work. \n\nI'm also frustrated because this ends up impacting the time we spend together. Sometimes (maybe half the time) I'll come over because we've made plans and it will take him HOURS to clean up around the house, take a shower, etc before we can leave. I end up helping him, which is fine, but I'm always like...hello? We went on a roadtrip together for the first time (just a quick 3 hour drive to his parents cabin in the mountains) and the drive ended up taking almost 6 hours because we had to stop every 20-30 minutes for one reason or another. I didn't get visibly frustrated, but I was so baffled and annoyed. I worry that this feeling will build up more over time and turn into something uglier. \n\nI truly do love my boyfriend so much. He is such a tender-hearted, caring person, and the other \"issues\" we've run into, if you can even call them that, have been so minor. We're both easygoing, but I'm definitely the ones who's more organized/on top of things/quick. But are we just not compatible? What conversation would you suggest having with him? Am I actually just too \"high strung\" to cope with his slower pace of living life? Is this possibly a mental health thing? \n\nTLDR: My (23F) boyfriend (24M) overcomplicates things to a frustrating degree and it's driving a rift between us, at least for me. Not sure how to approach it as I've never seen anyone else act like this. ",

I\u2019d be frustrated too. I\u2019m naturally fast at everything (thank you adhd) so he would literally be the worst thing ever. \n\nBut I hate to ask - but a lot of things take longer than you expect them to; are you sure it\u2019s him being slow or are you expecting him to be faster based on your standards, not factoring in that he might just not have done those things before so there\u2019s always a learning curve?",

If it\u2019s not 100% perfect, I will beat myself up over it.

        "text": "The story is that we were best friends who became lovers. We dated for about 6 months until one day, an ex of mine came up with screenshots from her anonymous messages app in which someone was claiming to be me and sending her texts about missing her. Couple this in with a conversation during that time (I was unaware of the anonymous messages) on facebook where I told her that I wasn't happy with life and that I was having some issues, she took the screenshots of both my messages and her anonymous messages, twisted it around painting me in a way that I was referring to not being happy in the relationship with her even though that was most definitely not the case before I could even tell her myself that she texted me. We were only 18, were young, dumb, immature and had a lot of communication issues. Now that we have been working on them and things have been getting better, she gave me her final concern.\n\nShe does not have any clarify or proof that it wasn't me who sent those anonymous messages and there is a part of her that can't trust me fully because of that, more so because the tone and the vibe of the anonymous texts matched with mine. She knows that she won't ever get anything concrete but it's difficult to brush it off and I'm not sure what I can do from my side to prove to her that she is my world.\n\nTldr: ex and I have worked on almost everything. The final hurdle is convincing her to fully trust me even though I had absolutely no hand in the situation and I'm not sure how I can reinforce her \n\nAny advice would be much appreciated ",

        "text": "My husband has been very controlling about what I wear. It\u2019s gotten so much worse over the years. We have been married 13 years. The more I give into his demands the more the bar raises and I can never seem to make him happy. For example: I wore leggings and a tank top everywhere. We have 4 kids, I\u2019m an active mom. I go to the gym and work out in the garden. He made a comment one day about how it was skin tight and why does everything I wear have to be vacuum sealed on? I added a sweatshirt around my waist then started wearing oversized Tshirts. Any shorts I wear no matter how long are criticized. I\u2019m down to just wearing pants and big Tshirts everywhere. He claims he can\u2019t stand women who flaunt their bodies and it\u2019s gross to him. He likes modest women. I obviously want to attract him, so I give into his demands. He also does not like if I wear make up when I leave the house if he isn\u2019t with me because \u201cit\u2019s not for him\u201d or I\u2019m \u201ctrying to get attention from others\u201d.\n\nWell, yesterday I found out he has been scrolling on FB watching thirst trap videos. What I\u2019m most annoyed about is him lying that he doesn\u2019t like women like that and makes sure to dim me down so nobody can find me attractive, but actively looks at other women regularly. He lied to my face and gaslit me until I found solid evidence of the video history. For the record, we share a burner FB account we use for market place. Neither of us are into social media at all, other than Reddit. I just noticed his Reddit app was deleted. I might have to dig into that. Anyway, I need advice for what to say to him to make him understand he can\u2019t control me anymore, that I don\u2019t dress for others?\n\nTl;dr: my husband is controlling of me and what I wear because he says he hates provocative women but looks at women online that wear skimpy outfits/bikinis.

He doesn\u2019t want you dressing in tight clothes because he doesn\u2019t respect the women that do, especially the ones making the thirst traps he lusts over. Scratch that, he doesn\u2019t respect women at all. And it\u2019s definitely a him thing. My ex was very much like this\u2026 he literally told me \u201cas a joke\u201d that I should be wearing a burqa (we\u2019re not even Muslim). He also lied, gaslit, and manipulated me too. My parents are old and come from a time where women wearing tight clothes or exposing their arms or legs was extremely shameful, and they\u2019ve never said shit to me when I\u2019ve worn tank tops, shorts, or other tight clothes, all my life. \n\nWhen you give in to his demands, you reinforce his control over you. The way he withholds affection and then tells you why later, and moves the goalpost, is bordering abusive behaviour. He deleted Reddit because he was more than likely doing shady shit like interacting with people who post thirst traps. I\u2019m willing to bet all my money that he\u2019s cheating on you. \n\nYou said you have kids and they notice this behaviour. If you\u2019re struggling to stand up for him for yourself, please do it for your kids. Your daughter will likely grow up to seek a man who also treats her like this, and your son will likely grow up to be man who treats other women like this. I doubt he\u2019s any better as a father if he\u2019s a shitty husband to you. \n\nI\u2019m considerably younger than you, but I\u2019ve seen where this road goes. He must be controlling in many other ways, and has totally gaslight, lied, and manipulated you sooo many other times. Don\u2019t let him suppress your expression of yourself, you\u2019ll only grow resentful and someday you\u2019ll be pissed you let that happen to you. I hope you drop this ass, for you and your kids.

I would beg her as a child to leave him. Let's go live somewhere to be happy. Of course, she would defend him and tell me not to make him angry and listen to him. Even after she had breast cancer,  he still treated her the same. I also believe my mom knew that my dad sexually abused me, not when it happened,  but later when I was a teenager.  My mom died of brain cancer at 45 years when I was 18 years old.\n\nFast forward 14 years later when my so-called father passed away. My brother and I were going through all his papers, and we found out that our parents had us before they got married. I called my aunt(mom's sister) and told her about the marriage certificate.  She replied that they tried to tell my dad to tell me so it wouldn't be a shock to my brother and I.  I told her it's not a big deal to me. My aunt praised her and had her so high pedestool, and then I said something about my mom not being perfect. My aunt yells me for saying that, and I turned around and said, \"If she really loved us, why didn't she leave him?\"  My aunt says to me that the family (mom's) told her to pack up everything, and everyone would come to help her move back home, give my brother and I a better life. She said no. Her reason......my dad would find her and kill her and possibly my brother and I.  My mom was right. I understood it so well when I heard how scared she was. I'm thankful that my father didn't go to that extreme. What he did was enough. \n\nIf you can tell your husband no and he accepts it, you're very lucky. Be confident enough that what you're doing is right for you  and your children. Others have posted, saying things about his abusive behavior and for you to leave. Please be careful if you think he will just accept what you say. Remember that your children see and hear more than you think.  Women  have more choices today and more places for help. I wanted you to be aware of the other side of the situation. You know him better than all of posting.  Stay strong!",

        "text": "hi, i\u2019m looking for some perspective on a roommate/friendship situation that\u2019s gotten complicated.\n\ni (21f) was planning to move in with two close friends next fall. we\u2019ve all known each other for 3+ years and had even toured apartments together, made spreadsheets, and were generally excited to live together. things felt okay until recently.\n\nshe and i have always had kind of a dynamic i can't explain. she\u2019s known as the \u201cmom friend\u201d, and she is very responsible,  academically driven, and she has a poised, slightly guarded personality. it\u2019s not that she\u2019s mean, but over time i've started noticing subtle things that made me feel kind of judged or small around her (comments about academics, lifestyle, etc.) she\u2019s will make slight comments that feel a little off, but she says them in such a neutral way that i question if i'm just being sensitive. she enjoys gossiping about other people's status and lifestyle and grades and such. \n\nsometimes she\u2019s very formal, warm, or talkative in group settings, but when we\u2019re alone, she\u2019s distant and kind of dry, like we are acquaintance. she laughs at jokes before the punchline, reacts unusually early to memes i show, and i often found myself carrying conversations or even sometimes asking questions i already know the answer to just to get her to talk. she never really asks about me or initiates unless it\u2019s something she's personally interested in. she's also a bit dry and cold to my boyfriend. but again, its nothing outright cruel. but it got to the point where for example, i'd hear someone in the kitchen and run out excited to show my other friend something, notice it was her, and instinctively revert to pretending to wash my hands and going back into my room. it's because sometimes i don't even know what to say, and end up saying stuff like \"but anyways,\", \"yeahhh, so\", \"anyways then...\"\n\nthe tension kind of progressed recently when she made a comment in front of me and another person (a negative comment about someone else who we don't know) that felt like a dig, and i asked her why she feels the need to discuss people that she doesn't know all of the time. i didn't yell or have a tone but i was just kind of barely holding back my annoyance. and instead of responding, she completely shut down, was silent for a minute and then redirected her attention away from me to the other girl in the convo like nothing happened. she didn't apologize, clarify, or even defend herself. since then, we haven\u2019t spoken directly at all. as soon as the other girl left the room she texted me asking if i was okay, and then a few days later she moved home before us. the girl and i ended up alone for 8 days, and she ignored me the entire time, would slip back into her room when i came out of mine, and avoided common areas in ways she hasn't before. when we were moving out of our apartment, she didn\u2019t say hi or bye while her parents were there, but was lovely to my mom and unusually polite to my boyfriend. she only texted after i\u2019d left the building, to say something logistical (did you check out yet). she left without saying bye knowing she will be gone for 1.5 years. \n\nand since then, she\u2019s still been texting in our group chat as normal, things like \u201cyou guys got this \u2764\ufe0f\u201d before a test, \"miss ya'll/ love ya'll\" and stuff. but we haven\u2019t resolved anything, or spoken.\n\nthe thing is, i have already made a mental backup plan for my living arrangements. if i do decide on this, the only thing left is telling my other friend in the group i\u2019m not moving in anymore, and i feel horrible about it because she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong and i actually enjoy living with her. i just don\u2019t know how to bring this up without it being a whole thing. and also, i keep wondering if im just reading into it or being overly sensitive. is this even worth ending a whole living situation over? its been a plan in progress for years. \n\ni guess what i want advice on is: does this sound like a legit reason to not want to live with someone? if so, how should i explain everything to my other friend? and is there a way to do this that minimizes the drama, or is that unavoidable? any advice would be appreciated.\n\n**tl;dr:** had a tense dynamic with a friend for a while (dry convos, judgmental comments, one sided energy). called her out about something, and she completely iced me out with no defense or convo, just silence. now she\u2019s acting like nothing happened in the group chat, hasn't reached out individually, and we were supposed to lease together next year. not sure if its worth backing out or not.

We\u2019ve had a lot of issues in the past.\n\nI was a sahm for a year and the money from selling our house was supposed to cover anything I would have provided. He was in charge of finances. I always asked how much money we had and was always told \u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d And never given a straight answer. When I pried, it always turned into a huge fight and he would name call and become enraged so it was always dropped. Well, when we moved, I found out on the drive over while trying to find a rental online, that we only had like $1k left (not enough to cover 1/3 of the cost to move in somewhere) and he had racked up $6k on my credit card without telling me he even used it (after I had just paid it down).\n\nI do not trust him with finances and never want to put myself in a position where I have to rely on him for anything again. He is totally irresponsible and won\u2019t tell me if something is wrong. He\u2019s also irresponsible around the house.\n\nI do the majority of the housework. He doesn\u2019t take the garbage out. He changes maybe a couple of our three kids\u2019 diapers a week. He hardly cooks. He doesn\u2019t do the dishes or laundry. Even I mow the lawn most of the time. It\u2019s like I have a fourth kid.\n\nOn top of it all, he has a video game addiction and refuses to do any activities in the weekend or even go outside for longer than maybe an hour tops. He just never wants to do anything but play his games. When he does play his games, he yells profanities for the kids to hear and if anyone walks in front of the tv, he has a meltdown. He also ignores any mischief the kids get into while playing so if I leave him alone with them (yes, he is informed that I\u2019m leaving the house), when I come back, the kids have gotten into things they can\u2019t have and made huge messes- he\u2019s totally oblivious.\n\nHe\u2019s often in some awful mood too where everything I say makes him angry. He uses language he shouldn\u2019t toward the kids and I and always tries to play the victim when confronted \u201cwell, you didn\u2019t listen to me.\u201d, \u201cwell, you know I\u2019m trying to do something\u201d, etc. he doesn\u2019t take responsibility unless I spend a good amount of time convincing him what he said was rude and hurtful.\n\nIntimacy is also bad. He doesn\u2019t like me cuddling with him, leaning against him, anything like that. He says he\u2019s always sore so it hurts him? But he does always expect and wants sex and acts like I\u2019m being an awful, neglectful wife when we don\u2019t have sex often.\n\nWe have talked about all these things many times. Nothing ever changes on his part. I\u2019ve had a lot of mental struggles in the past and worked on myself. I\u2019ve quit my addictions, I\u2019ve addressed my OCD and gotten treatment for it, as well as other things. He doesn\u2019t ever seem to change. He spends money the second he gets it, he talks how he wants, he plays his games all weekend most weeks, and he hardly does anything around the house.\n\nWell, I thought I knew what I was doing (leaving) but out of the blue, he started being helpful and kind about a week and a half ago. He started tidying up the house unprompted and actually going on family outings with us without moping and complaining about it for hours first.\n\nTL;DR He\u2019s been the way he is for years and years and has never changed his ways. Should I be hopeful because of how he\u2019s been behaving the past couple of weeks or should I just continue with the plans I already had to leave? I do have three kids as well and rely on my husband\u2019s parents three days a week for childcare. I don\u2019t think he would tell them to stop watching the kids on my days, but who knows- divorce brings out bad things in people. I do love him deeply platonically but feel totally disrespected and used by him. Can we ever have a peaceful relationship? Is there hope? Or should I continue my plans?",

It sounds more like he figured out that you were going to leave him and so he's finally putting in basic effort to make you stay. \n\nWhich might seem admirable but is actually a slap in the face. \n\nIt shows that he _knew_ exactly how he was failing you as a husband and father to your kids but _didn't care._ You stayed, and the fights and \"nagging\" weren't big enough consequences for him.\n\nYour husband got to do whatever he wanted on his terms and didn't care if it affected you and his kids negatively because he selfishly only thought of himself. \n\nNow that you've had enough and want to leave, he can sense it, and knows exactly what to do. There's no guarantee that he's going to keep up these new behaviors once he feels comfortable again. \n\nThe $$ issues are a much bigger red flag. He lied to your face for months and ran up your card without your knowledge. Where did it all go? How can you trust him to provide? Staying with him, you'll have 4 kids and one of them has access to your credit.  \n\nBrushing past previous egregious behavior doesn't solve the problem. If he were really interested in change for the better he would have an open and honest conversation with you about everything; the money, the avoidance, the lack of maturity. Everything. \n\nHis recent helpful actions are just further proof that he's leaving you out of the decision making process **again.** You're already questioning your decision to leave. If he can't be honest now, when? How long are you supposed to wait for him to get his shit together?\n\nIf you're still conflicted you should have a serious conversation with him about it all and see how willing he is to open up and be honest with you. Do it with someone you trust watching your kids in the house in another room maybe. Even previously non-violent men have killed their partners when they've tried to leave, having someone else there is another layer of protection.",

        "post-author": "Rare_Apricot481",
        "text": "Hi everyone. \n\nI've been with my boyfriend for nearly 5 years. He has always had longer timelines for relationship milestones than me, but I've been patient with him on things like becoming \"official\" or meeting his family. However, I just had my 30th birthday and things are starting to change for me when I think about my future. \n\nI always told my boyfriend that I wasn't in a rush to live together, but that I would definitely want to in my 30's. Neither of us has ever lived with a partner before, so this is completely new territory for both of us. I have expressed to him several times over the last year that I'm feeling ready to try living together, that it would make more sense logistically and financially for both of us, and that I feel it is a necessary step to take before even considering having children. As a woman of 30, the kids issue feels more pressing than it has before. \n\n  \nThere are a few important facts about our situation:\n\n  \n1. For the last year, a major construction site has been active beside my apartment. The site literally shares the wall with my bedroom and has made the house nearly unlivable. Constant noise from 7am-6 pm or even later, every weekday, sometimes reaching 100 decibels and beyond. The site has caused damage to the building and to the apartment in the form of broken pipes, cracked walls, mold and mildew, etc. I work from home most days of the week and the situation has had an extremely negative effect on my mental health, stress levels and work life. My boyfriend has offered to let me come to his place whenever I need to, but won't consider moving in together now as a long term solution. \n\n  \n2. My boyfriend purchased an apartment 6 months ago. He made this decision unilaterally. Though he did ask for my opinion about some things during his apartment search, he never even considered renting a place together, or buying a place big enough for both of us to live in. I was very hurt and upset by him making such a permanent decision, seemingly without including our relationship as a priority. He claims he always expected me to move into this apartment at some point, but won't give any sort of timeline or concrete ideas as to when. I also fear that if I did move in, it would be me living in his space, never us sharing our space. \n\n  \n3. We live in a country where rent and the cost of living is completely out of sync with salaries. It is by far the most expensive country on the continent. I work full time, but still cannot afford to move into another apartment of decent quality. If I moved now to escape the construction site, I'd have to either sacrifice space/ quality or move to a less safe neighborhood. I am currently searching for apartments, but leases here are generally 2 years, so moving to a new place would also prolong our eventual (perhaps hypothetical) cohabitation as well. \n\n  \n4. When we spend time together, 95%+ of the time, I go to his place. It has been this way since the beginning of our relationship. After nearly 5 years, it is annoying to have to pay bus fare/ taxi, plan outfits and what I need to bring ahead of time constantly, physically carry all my stuff back and forth, and then not have access to my foods and my things when I'm at his place. He has come to my place occasionally, but hasn't slept over a single time since the construction started. He also claims he can't work at my house because he needs to work on his desktop rather than laptop, so he's never stayed for more than a night when he has stayed. \n\n  \nWe have a really lovely relationship, we get along well and have a lot of fun together. We are very supportive of the others' careers and endeavors and never run out of things to talk about. But I just don't know how to move forward with this situation. I feel rejected in a way. I would hope my partner of 5 years would be thrilled and excited at the idea of living together, not hesitant and reluctant. I would also hope that upon seeing my daily suffering from the construction site and lack of viable alternatives, my partner would want to do anything possible to help me exit such a stressful and damaging situation. I do try to be understanding with him, though, because he has previously expressed that he sees living together as basically the same as marriage, whereas I see it as a necessary step before even considering marriage or children. (Which, by the way, he has confirmed many times that he does want to have children of his own.)\n\nI have brought it up with him several times during the last year and every time it's a no. Last time I brought it up I told him I was giving up on the idea. I don't want to force or pressure him into it. I want him to want it like I do. But if he doesn't... what can I do? Should I wait a while longer and see if he comes around? Cut my losses? Try moving to a new apartment of my own and reconsider why I want to live together in the first place? Bring it up and try to talk through it yet again?\n\nI really want us to work but I feel as though he has all the power and agency in the relationship at this point. I don't want to lose out on my opportunity to have a family because I'm waiting for someone else to make a decision.\n\n  \nAny advice is welcome! Again, I really love him and want to make it work with him if possible. \n\nTL;DR- My boyfriend of 5 years still doesn't want to live together despite the fact that we are in our 30's and my living situation sucks.   \n",

The reasons to have separate places are many - no arguments about chores, having an \"alone space\" for people who need a lot of time alone to recharge, some people feel like it stops people from getting too comfortable in the relationship, some people just don't like to compromise when it comes to their living space in general, it could be for health reasons (sleeping issues when someone else lives with you, very different wishes when it comes to heat/cold)...\n\n- I think you should definitely find a place for yourself to escape your currently horrible living situation. This means you should also accept that he is showing and telling you constantly that he *doesn't* want to live with you. Which is valid, but it's just as valid that you want him to shit or get off the pot after five years. Generally, the fact that he is doing a \"one day\"-thing (as in \"I want kids one day, I want to move in together one day) means nothing at this point anymore. I don't think he was wrong to buy the apartment he liked - but the fact that he bought it just like that shows that he has no idea when \"one day\" will be and it's possible that it won't be coming, ever. Some people just like the *idea* of something, but are so happy with how things currently are that they don't want the change. And, quite frankly, since you keep travelling to him for free all the time, why would he want to change his comfy life when he's happy like this right now?\n\nSo honestly, I think you need to find your spine instead of just catering to his wishes (when it comes to the free travel to his place) and some faint hopes that one day, things might change. You need change *now* because your living situation is hell.",

Or more accurately, you are a convenience girlfriend.\n\nYou come to him, you do everything on his timeline, and you even second guess if you should have a hard conversation with him. This is working out great for him. He still gets his space so he can leave at any time and he's got a girlfriend on demand.\n\nHe may say he loves you and wants to plan the future eventually but his actions aren't indicating that at all. He's stringing you along. If a 35 year old dude doesn't know if he wants to LIVE with you after 5 years, how much longer does he need? He's future faking you.\n\nRemember, dating is for figuring out if you are compatible. It's not for making it work at all costs.\n\nAnd you are dating the person as they are RIGHT NOW. Not some future version that easily takes next steps in the relationship or a future version who keeps his promises.\n\nSo are you compatible with a man who is willing to string along his girlfriend for years and won't help her even though moving in together would be so beneficial? Because that's the guy he is now. The guy he is now is content for you to stay in your bad living situation and come to him. The guy he is now is happy to exchange I love yous and say all the right words but never actually takes action.\n\nGo check out r/waiting_to_wed . Don't waste your youth on this guy.",

My best friend was married to her husband for just over 30 years, they had 2 kids, ran a business together, and were the happiest couple I've ever known. They never had fights, they'd just disagree about things occasionally and say \"big whoop!\" lol\n\nThey only lived together for about 3 months, and it nearly killed their relationship. They both just needed the ability to have their own space. They ended up buying houses across the street from each other, and that's how their entire marriage functioned. They'd have dinner and family time in one or the other house every day, and the kids had rooms in each house and would choose to sleep at mom or dads every night... if they wanted to sleep with each other they would and stay over night at each others place, but they didn't do it every night. It just wasn't a big deal.\n\nI have another friend whose been with his husband for 20 years, and they nearly broke up 5 years in because co-habiting was making them fight all the time. They owned both sides of a duplex and rented one half out, when their tenant left they were in the middle of figuring out if they should divorce and one of them moved into the other half of the duplex and they discovered almost immediately that everything between them went back to being lovely... it was the living together that was making them crazy. So they just live next to each other and are still very happily married.\n\nRelationships do not have to look just one way, they just need to really suit the people in them. Some people are together a lifetime and never co-habit or marry, some marry and never co-habit, some co-habit and never marry, some have separate bedrooms etc  etc etc.\n\nIf it's 100% a need of yours to live with him in order to be in a relationship with him, then that's one thing. If that is your need, then it sounds like he's just not the guy for you long-term and you should say goodbye now.\n\nIf it's not, then maybe you two should put your heads together to think of what might work instead and try that. Apartments in the same buildings or super close etc. What are your real long term goals together as a couple? How does living together or not facilitate them?\n\nThere's no 1 right answer, just what actually is right for you individually and as a couple.

I'm currently in one of those stages. So I understand how I can be difficult. I fixate on things that are making me unhappy and it literally becomes all I talk about. I can't seem to stop myself. And I will always find holes in any suggestions anyone makes.\n\nShe herself has had mental health struggles. So I honestly thought she may be kinder. But she isn't.\n\nA big part of my problem is my job. It's extremely stressful and I'm having a tough time. I'll have a breakdown about once a month and I want to leave but I'm a bit trapped.\n\nBut she just sees the money. It does pay relatively well. 63k in London. So it's decent but not outrageous. And personally I don't think it's enough to justify the way it makes me feel. But it's hard to find another role right now.\n\nIf I bring up anything about it she'll let out a really loud sigh. Then say she's sick of hearing about it and doesn't want to talk again. She says I'm paid too much. Thinks junior doctors are 'moaners' even though they are criminally underpaid for what they do. and basically just gets really irritated and argues with me when I'm saying I'm not doing too well.\n\nMy dad is super kind about it. But she will do this thing where she makes it about her. Always goes 'oh well I always say everything I can but it's never enough and clearly I'm a terrible mother'. Then starts getting emotional and crying and I end up apologising for inconveniencing her. Even though I'm the one struggling.\n\ni don't know how to deal with her anymore. I may have to move home if I quit this job and she will be quite tough to deal with when I'm in a low patch. She herself doesn't work and hasn't for years.\n\nCan anyone help with this? Maybe I'm just a terrible person but I feel like I need more support sometimes than to just be told I earn too much and shouldn't feel anything because of this. Then make it all about how it's because she's a terrible mother and nothing she ever says is right.\n\nThanks\n\ntl;dr my mum doesn't support me at all when I'm struggling and makes it all about her.",

        "text": "edit: Questioning not question via title\n\nI (20M) recently had a serious and emotional conversation with my partner (20F) of nearly a year. There has been pain in our past, primarily caused by repeated dishonesty. While I have offered her forgiveness, the effects of those actions remain.\n\nMy partner has since acknowledged her mistakes and is actively working on personal growth, attending therapy, journaling, and striving to be more honest. She has expressed a desire to change, not only for the sake of the relationship, but also for her personal development. She said she would understand if I chose to leave, but she wants to demonstrate her growth through consistent actions.\n\nWhen reflecting on our relationship, I questioned why we are still together. My partner asked if I am staying to see if it is worth it through this period of change. I feel uncertain as if the damage might already be too significant. I care about her deeply, but I also wonder whether I deserve to be with someone who wouldn\u2019t have caused this pain in the first place.\n\nWe both acknowledged that the future is unclear. I am open to healing and growth, but I do not want to remain in a relationship simply out of habit or fear of the unknown. While I appreciate her effort to rebuild trust, I continue to question whether love and effort are enough to overcome repeated hurt. How can I be sure that I am staying for the right reasons, and not just because I am afraid to walk away?\n\nTL;DR: My partner has hurt me in the past but is now working on personal growth. I\u2019ve forgiven them, yet I still feel uncertain about our future. While we both care, I\u2019m unsure if that alone is enough. I\u2019m torn between continuing the relationship and letting go.

Are they working? \nEven if she does change are you able to completely forgive her, or will you always be second guessing? Will it always be in the back of your mind? If you walk away will you always wonder if you had stayed?\nThe only things I am certain of are that either way you will always be wondering \u201cwhat if\u201d, and that life is full of difficult decisions to which there are no right answers. Life is all about choices and the decisions we make. You cannot live in the past, you cannot wait for the future. You can only live in the now, or you will just end up being the past while you waited for the future to turn up.\nOne way to decide is to take a coin. Heads for one choice, tails for the other. Most times before the coin even drops you will be hoping for one answer over the other. Go with that and ignore the coin .\nHope that helps.",

If you truly believe she's doing the hard work to change herself and you truly have forgiven her, its worth giving the relationship more time to see if she follows through.  Esp if she can pin down the reason she lies, because she can work to stop that impulse if thats what it is. A lot of children learn to lie as a default to protect themselves from abuse, for example. \n\nBut trust is one of the most important things that need to be present for a successful relationship. I'd understand if you felt the trust was irrevocably broken. Since we don't have details about what she did, we can't really speak to the specific issues and if they're fixable. If you feel that there is room for redemption and that you will be able to trust her again, then give it six months or a year and see if she builds back your trust. \n\nYou're young. Most people at 20 are not dating the person who will turn out to be their life partner. Not to be negative, thats just statistics. The easy way out would be to split, so its really up to you to decide how much more you want to try.",

        "text": "\nMy fianc\u00e9 (26F) and I (28M) are getting married in a few months, but lately, I\u2019ve been feeling uneasy about her habit of lending money to her family without discussing it with me first.\n\nLast year, she lent her brother $500 from my account without asking, and recently, she used my credit card to pay $1,500 for her parents\u2019 car repair. Each time, she apologizes and promises to pay me back, but I feel like this is a breach of trust.We\u2019ve always agreed to discuss major financial decisions together, especially since we\u2019re about to get married. However, she seems to think that since we\u2019re family now, helping each other financially is normal, even without prior discussion.I understand that family is important, but I believe in transparency and mutual agreement when it comes to money, especially large sums. \n\nHow can I approach this conversation with her without making her feel like I\u2019m attacking her family? I want us to be on the same page financially before we tie the knot. \n\nTL;DR: fiance is lending money to her family - how do I approach her ",

                        "body": "Yeah...  I actually make more than my husband.  But when I wanted to give my nephew cash for graduation, my bank was not convenient (we have separate accounts and therefore separate fun/do-what-you-want-money).  So I swing by the bank where we have a shared account to grab $100 in small bills.  I told him I'd be doing it and transferring money from my personal account to put it right back.  \n\nAnd that was just a hundred bucks being SHIFTED not loaned.  And we've been married 13 years.  We are 100% transparent on our funds.  Which is why we keep separate spare funds (though I will note, we are both added to each other's accounts in case of emergency so he could always peek at my account if he pleases).  As long as we're both meeting our budget and savings goals, the rest of the money is no judgement.  \n\nSounds like she needs this set up.  She has HER MONEY she can lend out (after all household expenses and savings are met).  As long as she only touches HER FUND you don't have to say.  But when her fund runs out, no more loaning.  And if she can't afford that new outfit or gas or coffee cause she loaned all her spending money out, too bad.\n\nShe might also be bad with money.  I find that when one person handles all the finances, the other can get lost and oblivious.  Like my husband and I both contributed to the mortgage account, but I was the one who paid the bill every month.  My husband has no reason at all to doubt me, but every month I'd pay the mortgage and an extra just-to-principal payment as budgeted.  I always made sure to share a screenshot shot showing both payments and the remaining balance.  He knew that 100% of the money he gave me for the house was being put on the house.  Similarly, he tells me what the utilities are each month and when insurance is paid on our cars.  We don't make it a big deal or even a sit down.  Sometimes it's literally just yelling across the house.  \n\nBut if one of us is hurt or worse, we both know roughly how much is in every account, we both have access to all accounts.  We both know what needs to be paid.  And if I want to spend $300 on a bat house, he can't say shit cause I saved my extra money for that.\n\nETA: I'm the one who spends, not my husband.  Hence this set up.  He would always be like \"did you NEED another shirt?\" Because he spends nothing and I like stuff.  \n\nSo our system is budgeted to which bills we each pay.  We each have our savings goal for the month.  After that, the rest is for our own expenses.  Like right now there's a ton of extra in my personal savings so I can finish my tattoo sleeve in the winter.  But I had to save my personal extra money for that because it's a want, not a need.\n\nAnd just because our savings are technically in different banks, doesn't mean we can use them.  That's FAMILY SAVINGS.  If I want to touch my savings that includes my savings budget, he has to know.  We each know how much the other has in their savings account because we consider that shared money. We've just been too lazy to combine it since we have separate banks.",

She helped herself to your money.\n\n$500 cash and $1500 on a credit card without asking is pretty steep for most folks in this economic environment.\n\nI'm not sure why this is a 'discussion'.  It should be a breakup given that she didn't ask, she just took, and hoped that you wouldn't notice.  When you mention it, you get a performative \"Sorry\", and a lie about paying you back, and continued theft.\n\nWhen someone shows you who they are believe them the first time.  She doubled down and increased her initial theft by an amount 3x the original theft.  Why does she not have her own credit card to have 'lent' the $1500 for car repair?  If she does, what debt is she carrying now that you may not know about?  Was it really a car repair?  At that repair price point, I would have traded the car in for another one.  Was she even telling the truth about that?  Or was the $1500 a down payment for a car purchase for them?\n\nYou sir, need to realize that this is a pattern of behavior and lack of moral character.  Do you want this type of person as your life partner, and possible mother of your child?\n\nCheck your credit to make sure that she hasn't opened credit cards or applied for a loan under your name.  Lock your credit down and secure your financial info.  Revoke any shared credit cards, get new credit and debit cards, cancel the existing ones.\n\nVia her lack of reaction to being confronted and continued theft, she knows that she has you wrapped around her little finger as you have done nothing to protect yourself but mildly protest her thefts.\n\nIf you can take the financial hit, just take this as the $1500 fee to discover that you are considered the family ATM to these folks.  Get this woman out of your life before she ruins you financially.\n\nIf you don't want to take the $2000 hit, demand a payment schedule in writing so that you can take her to court later if she defaults.  You could also, if she was not an authorized user of either account, report the thefts to the police.   The $500 is gone for sure, but a police report could erase the $1500 from your credit card.\n\nIn short,  the silver lining is that she showed her true self before you married her.  Thank the universe for the warning.\n\nIMO, protect yourself and breakup with this person.\n\nShe also has family nearby that she can move in with.\n\nSorry that your heart is taking a hit at this discovery.\n\nStop having sex with her immediately.  Once you start showing that you are drawing a hard line, she may attempt an \"Oops baby\".  Get out while the leaving is easy with no kids involved.  The last thing you need  is an 18 year child  support obligation.\n\nHugs.",

This is a *huge* red flag in and of itself.  But, the fact that she's taking your money without permission makes it even worse.\n\nI would communicate the seriousness of this issue by putting an indefinite hold on your engagement.  Then ask yourself:  Is 26F the business partner you want for the rest of your life?  Make no mistake, marriage *is* a business partnership, which is why money is in the top 3 reasons for divorce.\n\nIf you get past that threshold question (either immediately or over time after she shows you she can be fiscally responsible), then you have to create a framework for money in your relationship.  One option is to completely separate finances, so she has to give money to her family from the money she has left over after necessary bills are paid.  Another option is to agree upon a set amount per year year that can be allocated to helping family and it is a set amount.  You could fund a separate bank account that she can draw from for this purpose and *only* that bank account.\n\nThis is a very serious issue--both the fiscal irresponsibility and the breach of trust.

                "body": "Hello I am (24F) been married for 6 years and with my husband for 8 years. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re wanting to address this because this is a very important conversation to have before getting married. I have a few suggestions on how you can approach it in a calm, respectful, and constructive way that focuses on your shared future rather than blame or criticism\n\nFirst pick a calm, private moment when you\u2019re both not stressed or distracted. Avoid bringing it up in the heat of the moment or when either of you is already emotional.\n\nSecond, lead with your intentions! Make it clear that you\u2019re coming from a place of love and partnership, not control or judgment.\nYou could say: \u201cI want to talk about something that\u2019s been on my mind because I care deeply about our future together. This isn\u2019t about your family, it\u2019s about us and how we handle things as a team.\u201d\n\nThird, express how it makes you feel, not just what happened. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to avoid sounding accusatory. Example: \u201cWhen money is lent or spent from our shared resources without us talking about it first, I feel left out and a little disrespected. It makes me worried about how we\u2019ll manage bigger financial decisions in the future.\u201d\n\nFourth, reaffirm shared values and goals. Emphasize that you\u2019re both on the same team, and that your concern is about building a healthy foundation.\nExample: \u201cI know family is incredibly important to you, and I admire how generous you are. I just think we need to make sure we\u2019re being transparent and aligned financially, especially with big expenses so that we can avoid stress and resentment.\u201d\n\nFifth, set clear boundaries and agreements.This isn\u2019t about forbidding her from helping family, it\u2019s about making decisions together.\nYou could suggest: \u201cCould we agree to talk about any expenses over $200 or $300 before making them? That way we both feel included and responsible.\u201d\n\nSixth, propose having a joint financial strategy that includes some room for helping family, if that\u2019s important to her.\nExample: \u201cMaybe we can even set aside a small \u2018family support\u2019 fund each month, so there\u2019s a clear limit and we both know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nlastly, listen actively after you share your thoughts and give her space to respond. She may have reasons or feelings you weren\u2019t aware of. Be ready to validate her emotions while still standing firm on the importance of financial trust and transparency. This conversation isn\u2019t just about the money, it\u2019s about partnership, trust, and shared decision making. The goal is to move forward together, not to win an argument or blame her. If it\u2019s hard to resolve on your own, premarital counseling can be an excellent space to sort through this with support.",

        "text": "I\u2019ve been dating my a friend for (f30) for 2 months and we were friends for 3 months before this. \n\nI\u2019m very calm, chill person but can be extroverted in some social settings. And she\u2019s switched on to go all the time. \n\nShe\u2019s been in 2 pretty awful relationships with women in the past. One was violent and manipulative and another very anxious. They hated on a lot of her friends causing some to cut themselves out of her life etc. \n\nThe insecurities im dealing with is how highly she speaks of a new friend of hers. She was feeling low this morning and says \u201cI\u2019ll switch up once I see Claire\u201d, \u201cClaire will cheer me up\u201d. Last night it\u2019s \u201cI love Claire, she\u2019s my wife, she\u2019s such an amazing great human being, being with her fills my cup\u201d \u201cshe\u2019s great she supports me without me needing to ask as she knows I won\u2019t ask\u201d \u201cwifey has my back\u201d.\n\nA barrier I\u2019ve faced is her saying I\u2019m important and a priority but I get very little verbal reassurance so hearing how passionate she is about Claire seems to hit a nerve. So I\u2019m unsure if this is something I need to work on internally within myself or something else. I guess I feel like I want to be the person she says will cheer her up, will have her back. In the past she told me shares with Clare if she\u2019s feeling down and she loves how she immediately asks for a call to talk it through but said she can\u2019t do that with me as it means being more vulnerable and it\u2019s harder to let me in. \n\nShe also has an ex is mentally unwell and pretty much stalks her. And Sarah shared she can\u2019t stop talking with her as she could serious harm herself and she\u2019s lost an ex to that in the past as she her partner at the time wasn\u2019t happy with it. I realised her ex will always be in the picture it seems. Unless her ex stops texting then she won\u2019t stop conversing as she doesn\u2019t want her to lose it and hurt herself. This person will continue being a parasite for a very long time. And won\u2019t let her go. \n\nNon of this makes me feel good. And unsure on if I should continue. \n\nShe\u2019s has great qualities. Easy to talk to, cared for me when I was very upset, so empathetic and emotionally intelligent. \n\nTL:DR\n\nDo I need to do something work on myself to be more secure or are these things to raise and maybe part ways due to my insecurities?",

        "text": "\nMy boyfriend m23 and i f21 live each by our own family. We live a 45 min drive away from each other. We had chatted about him comming down to me, but whenever we are going to talk about the specific time, he can never choose a time. It's always \"around these hours\". \n\nThis weekend he agreed on comming to my place today at around 6-7pm. Earlier today he had a plan with his sister that he said would be around 2-3 hours long. So I said okay to him thinking he'll arrive at like around 6-7pm. Now its 5:28pm and he is still with his sister and he hasn't texted me at all about me and him meeting. He's just sent me videos of him and his sister having fun. And that's fine they're having fun, I just feel so unimportant that he is not thinking about texting me that the plan on timing will change.\n\n I feel like a floater girlfriend. I have not texted him about it because I don't wanna be mean or sound mean and make his mood bad. I just feel sad. Because here I am with no text at the time he said he could arrive on. It feels like he does not want me enough to plan any specific time. Sometimes I can be late as well but I update him a lot about it and apologize when it happens but that's because I run around stressed and packing. But 90% of the time he comes later is because he hangs out with his family. \n\n\nAnd I just feel like I'm below his family. We've only been together for 2 years, but its just... I would choose him over my family. But he wouldn't. And I don't know what to do with these thoughts. I don't know how to bring it up to him. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do.\n.\n.\n.\nI don't know if I'm allowed to be upset at him over him not reaching out to me about the plans being changed?\n\n\nTldr: my boyfriend never agrees on meeting on any specific time, its always (example: \"around 6-9pm\") , I feel unimportant..",

        "title": "Trying to learn how to trust my boyfriend\u2019s (32M) friendships w/coworkers after my ex-husband of 10 yrs left me (40F) to marry his coworker",
        "post-author": "RoutineRepublick",
        "text": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m looking for advice on learning to trust my relationship after going through betrayal trauma in my previous relationship/marriage. I\u2019m doing all of the \u201cnormal\u201d things (therapy, journaling, etc), but it feels like I\u2019m never going to be able to get past the trauma and PTSD that I deal with from how my marriage ended\u2026.\n\nI\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for 3 years now. He is literally perfect\u2026..the sweetest, most considerate, most loving, most thoughtful, most supportive, most consistent man I\u2019ve ever met. I literally ask myself every single day how I was able to come across someone with SUCH a beautiful spirit, I feel incredible grateful to be here\ud83d\udc9c.\n\nThe problem that I\u2019m having is that after being married to my kids\u2019 father for 10 years, trusting him FULLY, and then finding out that the coworker of his that I always wondered about and always asked him to draw boundaries with was an actual problem and that they were having a full blown affair (once I discovered the affair, we \u201cworked on our marriage\u201d for an extra year while he continued to cheat and I ultimately decided that I couldn\u2019t be with him any longer\u2026..they got married 3 months after our divorce was final), it\u2019s been really hard for me to trust my boyfriend in regards to his friendships with female coworkers, 2 specific ones in particular. \n\nI believe in platonic friends and he\u2019s never done anything wrong when it comes to them necessarily, but every single time they interact over text or have conversations over the phone (he will even talk to them on speaker and show me the text convos to prove that the convos are innocent), my anxiety is through the roof. Recently he stated that he wanted to give me FULL access to these friendships, but wanted to delete the text threads entirely to start fresh (to avoid me seeing insignificant texts that may read strangely and it send me into a tailspin) and then give me his password in case I wanted to ever check his phone, at any time. I\u2019ve checked a few times but I hate feeling like I need to, and I never find anything strange.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t work with these ladies anymore, but when he did, with the first one, he used to go on daily Starbucks runs with her, help her in her dept a lot, talk and text quite a bit, and she used to pop up in his office while we were on the phone or would call his desk phone a few times a week (he would always put her on speaker, it was always innocent) - she\u2019s married, two young children. With the other one, she made passes at him the first year they worked together (he would curve her each time), but then decided that she would stop with those since he wasn\u2019t entertaining them, they had a short hiatus when she switched jobs, and then she returned to his building and what was once a sporadic coworker relationship turned into a friendship- to the point that now they catch up a few times per month to see how life is treating the other since they no longer work together (she\u2019s engaged but her fianc\u00e9 is long distance).\n\nHe\u2019s gone out for drinks with these ladies plus one other one at his job (that one acts like a little sister to them and I\u2019ve never been concerned with her), and they\u2019re all good friends/had group chats, etc., but he\u2019s never crossed lines that I\u2019ve known of and they refer to me a lot, but I\u2019ve never involved myself either. \n\nI know that 90% of this anxiety I have is due to the way my marriage ended and my ex husband betraying me with his coworker, and I really want to find a way to get past it\u2026it\u2019s a daily struggle and a big source of stress for me, but he enjoys these friendships and I don\u2019t want to place restrictions on him based on my own trauma. Just looking for practical ways to look at this situation in a healthy way.\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend got really close with 2 female coworkers (daily Starbucks runs with one, texting, talking on the phone, going out for drinks as a group- one is married, one is engaged) and now that they no longer work together, they still keep in touch, but I\u2019ve been uncomfortable with these relationships since the beginning because of my ex-husband of 10 years cheating on me and leaving me to marry his coworker and I\u2019m trying to learn to trust my boyfriend when it comes to them. Boyfriend has given me full access to check his phone to reassure me that it\u2019s all innocent and has always answered their calls around me on speaker, etc., but I\u2019m still extremely anxious anytime he talks to them.\n",

But cheating happens when a partner is a POS and not only doesn\u2019t respect their partner but also does not love them. A POS partner will look for someone to cheat with anywhere they go: at the gym, at a store, etc. In therapy the important part is to learn to remove work from the reason your ex cheated. Because that wasn\u2019t the reason nor the catalyst. \n\nHealing is important for many reasons for yourself but also for future partners. I have a few close male relationships. At the same time, my husband is part of those relationships even if it me retelling a conversation etc.",

Documenting can help you keep your thoughts organized and prevent your fears running away with you. \n\nYou can't stop someone from cheating if that's what they want. They make the choice and you're just not a factor in that.  But you can take on certain baggage and put down what's not yours. Your ex had poor decision making cos along with his marriage and kids, he put his job and career at stake too. Full on, fuck his life.

It wasn't the stress. It wasn't the friendships. It wasn't even 'the other woman'. It wasn't anything I did or didn't do.\n\nIt was selfish, entitled person making a choice, and lying about it. Instead of at very least facing the end of a relationship with honestly and respect, it was the choice to betray.\n\nYou're not extending your BF the trust to have friends or work late. You're extending him the trust that he won't purposefully break his agreements,\u00a0betray you and lie about it. Not if a Victoria's Secret model throws themselves at him. Not if he has a drink with a coworker.\n\nBecause nothing actually causes cheating except the cheater's choices.\n\nIn terms of managing your anxiety, I'd say you need to find some tools for when it's peaking. Activities you can engage in to help you not get into the cycle. Working out, baking, and crafting. All things that helped me when my anxiety peaks. Breaking the physical patterns of experiencing anxiety is what helped me actually let go of the cognitive patterns I was locked into. When the mind is locked in, train the body to do something else, and the mind follows. \n\nI would also suggest that part of that for you should be stopping policing his phone and texts. That's not providing any real security; that's *security theatre*. And it keeps you *practicing* and empowering the distrust and anxiety that you're supposed to be putting an end to.",

        "text": "My (24F) best friend, 'C' (24F) has recently started dating my boyfriend's (25M), friend (24M), 'N'. \n\nFor context, they met around New Years 2025, so it has only been 5 whole months that they have been dating. At first, he seemed cool and fun, I symathized with his broken past (orphaned, parents used to do drugs, his parents both recently died within a year). \n\nHowever, his insecurities cause many issues for their relationship. Starting with the first fight they had, which was around March (3 months dating), he got upset with her for not admitting her body count, which he demanded to know. She never answered because she knew it would only lead to a negative reaction, or it just didn't matter. Weird, right? He explained that it is important for him to know things like this. Within this same conversation, C mentioned a friend who has been 'hooking up' with this girl she knows from her school. He got furious that her friends subscribe to hook up culture, and that it is a bad reflection of her having these kinds of people in her life (to influence her). Lastly, he asked if she has ever dated a black guy (they are both white), to which she truthfully responds, 'yes'. That fight blows over, but the more recent, prolonged one ensued as follows.\n\nC got accepted to study abroad for the summer (1 month). She applied well before she even met N. The days leading up to her leaving, N expressed he was uncomfortable and even admitted insecure about her leaving. He mentioned again, he does not even know her body count or her whole dating history, and to top it off, he also cannot stop thinking about the black guy (lol). He claimed that not knowing these things attributed to not knowing her character. So, she needs to prove herself worthy to him. Ew! This broke her heart that he needed all this extra info to be able to think well of her, because he could only imagine what she has done in her past. The entire week before leaving, she was anxious due to his unstable emotions. Another instance was she and N went to her hometown 45 min away to visit her parents and friends who came from out of town to have a reunion/going away party. N chose to finish his hw that night, so he was not present during the party and he did not even say goodbye to everyone that night. This also hurt her feelings, of course. Overall, they fought about everything and she would tell me how she was constantly crying. To me, how can a grown man be okay with making his woman cry? \n\nHe also constantly drags C for working too much. She is in law school and also works at a firm as an apprentice lawyer under supervision of her boss. N is in school for Kinesiology so he claims the stress is killing her. Also, he hates her cat. I think both of these things are 'distractions that divert her attention away from him'. He has not admitted this, but it is what it seems. When he should be supportive, he tries to tear her down. I have dated a very toxic guy before, and I can see a lot of similarities in him.\n\nI highly respect my friend, and I love her so much, but I am afraid of losing her. Whether it be because she ditches her friends to give attention to N, or I get too fed up with constantly hearing about what she puts up with.\n\nI suppose I am asking reddit for advice? \n\n  \nTL;DR. Best friend dating very insecure guy, and now i hate him and I am unsure what to do.",

        "text": "Hi, i (21F) have two uni friends (22F) and (23M) who are in my class. I got really close with the last two years. Especially with (22F) whoI've known her since first year (we have four years of uni). I've been noticing for a while they have been icining me out for no aparent reason. It came to ahead now that now exams are over I messaged the group chat they are all in if people would like go and do something fun but they have left it without replying for 11 days now. I know that (22F) is online but just not replying and both are in the city for as far as I can tell. Why could they be ignoring me? We haven't even graduated yet, we still have time and I have been spending time with other university friends. \n\nI've been wracking my brain and I don't think I've done anything actively wrong to them that would warrant being iced out. The only thing that comes to mind is that I got upset over group chat messages because they didn't tell me about an exam after I couldn't attend a lecture (basically saying similar to \"why didn't anyone tell me\ud83d\ude2d\" ). The final message I sent on this theme was never seen by 22F and was sent two weeks ago. But even before this they have been super weird and avoiding me since the easter term started (April/May). I know this is more than overthinking when at a birthday party 23M avoided me then walked home with another friend (23NB) without me, leaving me alone in a part of the city I feel very unsafe in . \n\nSo what do I do? I've messaged them both privately saying similar to: \"if you aren't busy we could do something but it's no issue if not\". Should I have messaged them privately? And if they don't reply do I just give up? Because it will be very awkward in the graduations to be seeing and sitting by them, especially as now I'm upset at them for ignoring me both online and in person. Have I misconstrued it and they are just wrapped up in their own problems and aren't texting me back because of them? \n\nThanks in advance reddit \n\nTL;DR uni classmates are icing me out, what do i do? Especially as I am seeing them at graduation and I care about them\n\nEdited for my terrible grammer\ud83d\ude2d",

        "post-author": "foundadeeperwell",
        "text": "I\u2019m going to try and keep this as brief as possible but some detail is needed for context.\n\nTLDR:\n\nHusband daily messaging attractive female co-worker for months when I was struggling on maternity leave alone with a newborn, after I\u2019d previously raised concerns about her. 18 months have passed and still can\u2019t trust/forgive. \n\nFull post:\n\nMy husband (34M) and I (34F) work for the same company (in very different areas of the business) and have a two year old. We\u2019ve been together going on 9 years and married for almost 4. I\u2019d say we\u2019ve had a fairly happy, close relationship aside from this issue other than typical relationship bickering and some differences which periodically rear their heads. \n\nHowever, 18 months ago, when I was 6 months postpartum and on maternity leave, I found out my husband had been communicating heavily with a female co-worker in his area who he used to manage. She\u2019s around 5 years younger, attractive, unmarried, no kids, a boyfriend she seems not very interested in and successful in her career (significantly more senior in the business than myself and in the same role as my husband). \n\nTo this day, I still do not know the full extent of their relationship but I do know they exchanged messages on the work system most days (often for a lot of the day) for several months until I found out, during the period after we had our baby. My husband was primarily working from home during this time so he\u2019d be messaging her upstairs around doing his work whilst I was downstairs in the house, really quite struggling, alone with a very demanding newborn that we had various particular challenges with. \n\nI only had opportunity to skim small portions of the messages but the chats were mostly day to day chit chat, confiding in one another about work matters or annoyances, mildly flirtatious humour but I didn\u2019t see anything particularly worrying as far as confessing feelings, no criticism of each of their relationships etc. But like I say, I only read a small proportion of it all and given his demeanour when showing me the messages and a comment he made that \u2018I would be upset if I read them\u2019, my assumption is there was stuff lurking in there that may have been worse.\n\nWhen this all came out, it also transpired that he had been deleting her name from his list of work chats to hide it from me, should I have looked at his computer (as the messages themselves can\u2019t be deleted). \n\nA key point here is that I\u2019d raised questions/concerns about his relationship with this girl a few times over the course of around two years prior to me finding out the above. I\u2019d previously asked if they message etc and he\u2019d essentially said no. My concerns were prompted by behaviour I\u2019d witnessed with my own eyes (which I was only privy too because, as above, we work for the same company and therefore both attend some big events) consisting of her being a big drinker who becomes very tactile when drunk - albeit, with a lot of men, but that included my husband. I could also just \u2018sense\u2019 an atmosphere between them that hinted to me there were some feelings on one or both sides. Some frostiness from her towards me. There\u2019d be some subtle behaviour changes from him that I\u2019d thought may link to her, including: seeming to maybe be paying more attention to his appearance when she would be in the office, seeming never to miss a night out when she\u2019d be there and often not inviting me along, continuing to have regular diarised catch-ups with her at work despite no longer being necessary for work reasons, my husband always having headphones on for meetings at home so I couldn\u2019t hear anything. He has good explanations for all of this/would say its coincidental or I was reading into things. \n\nMy husband maintains strongly to this day that he was only ever friends with this girl. He refuses to accept any feelings were held. I absolutely cannot believe this for one second on the basis of everything I know. Why would he be willing to repeatedly lie to me and risk our relationship when we\u2019ve just had a child for some \u2018friend\u2019? He alleges his secrecy was because he knew I\u2019d unfairly react about him having a female friend if I found out given what I\u2019d asked about her previously. He alleges nothing more ever happened. \n\nAfter I found out, he massively reduced communication with her (from what I understand) but was still having periodic unnecessary catch ups (which he said was bc it would seem odd and cause trouble for him to cancel them) until I raised it didn\u2019t feel fair, and would still hang out a little at the odd work event or chat in the office. He left the company recently so I believe all communication has now stopped. \n\nThe problem is, 18 months on, I just can\u2019t get over it.  I don\u2019t believe he has been honest with me about the nature of the relationship since I found out about this, which perpetuates my lack of trust and has made it harder to move on from. Our lives have been back to normal from about a week after this all happened, although with periodic conversations about it when I can\u2019t help myself but communicate its on my mind. But I just cannot accept that he would do this when I was at my most vulnerable with our new baby after I\u2019d said so many times previously that I was worried about her and he\u2019d told me I was being silly. Even if nothing ever physically came of it. I can\u2019t shake a sense of not being emotionally safe with him and not being able to trust him. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to rebuild trust and move on from something like this? \n\nIt\u2019s worth saying, my husband does have a lot going for him: is very attractive, funny, confident, intelligent and also happens to earn a lot of money, which primarily funds our lifestyle. Obviously none of this is enough if hes not also, and more importantly, kind and trustworthy, however I really don\u2019t want to break up our family whilst we have young child(ren) if avoidable. ",

Admit that if the roles were reversed and I lied to you and behaved how you did with a male coworker FOR YEARS you would be livid and heartbroken. Admit that I don\u2019t deserve the way you treated me. Admit your relationship with this girl was inappropriate and you put it before me and our marriage. Agree to go to couples therapy (and actually go) and work your ass off to earn my trust back because right now my trust for you is almost non existent. \n\nTell him his behaviour has clearly traumatised you and it hurts that he doesn\u2019t see that and that hasn\u2019t been protective in doing all he can to make you feel safe and respected (IE cutting off all contact with this girl).\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t do all that I\u2019m sorry I\u2019d call it.

It makes me question my own worth and I constantly scrutinise ways in which I must not have been good enough to compete with her and what I have to do to better. \n\nMy view of his character has totally changed to see him as selfish, secretive and a bit cold hearted. I\u2019m constantly aware of his propensity to make more decisions in his own interests that are going to impact our family.\n\nHe starts a new job at another company soon where I won\u2019t be half as aware of his relationships and I\u2019m almost just waiting for this to happen again with someone else.

When we are married, it is our own personal responsibility to turn away when we see people who spark that interest in us instead of fostering the connection as if we are single. If your husband was like wow, I am really attracted to her, it would be his responsibility as a husband and a father to diminish that relationship as much as possible. He should have chosen to put his energy into your growing family, that is what a good husband and father would do. \n\nSo forgive him if you want, only you have to live your life, but remember that he wasn't caught up against his will by the fates.

Going to couples therapy also won't help because he has shown no interest in acknowledging your hurt feelings or wanting to resolve this. He doesn't care!!!

        "text": "Me and my bf (both 24) have been in a relationship for a year. We have shared interest in reading and weightlifting, we are both somewhat nerdy and we really love being around each other and in each others presence. When we met I felt like this would be so different from my past relationship where it ended after two years because I felt like it was difficult to be myself, I had more fun with my friends and could relax more with them, and I couldn't open up - or didn't want to talk to him about the every day stuff in life, and he couldn't empathize at all with me when I brought up things I struggled with in my life.\n\nI am on exchange studies and have realized that I want to move abroad again for my last semester of my degree, which would be in about 8 months. Being apart has not been super easy, but not super hard - we've talked on the phone, texted and spent time gaming together almost every weekend. He expressed some sadness at the possibility of me moving again, but it would be an amazing opportunity for me, and I asked if he would be willing to move with me for just five months, which he would not (and I completely understand that and think it's reasonable). He wants to live in our home country for the future while I want to move around and live in different places, and while he's said he might be interested in living abroad some day I am actively taking steps towards this and he is not. I am more free with spending my money even as a student, and he holds on to his very tightly and often complains about prices - in spite of working and earning a good salary, with low living costs.\n\nWhen he visited me here it became abundantly clear to me that the things me and my friends laugh about and have fun talking about in group conversations, he doesn't join in and is not actively engaging in - regardless of it's my friends here or at home. I don't click super well with his friends either. He is way more introverted than me, so I always thought that might be it, but this makes me feel like we are very different as people and it's at a point where I just laugh so much more and am so much more relaxed around my friends than I am around him. I wish we could have the same free flowing conversations but it feels like we don't get that deep and I don't know if it's either of our faults or if we just are too different. When I've brought up feeling like this he always says that just because it's different between the two of us vs with our respective friends doesn't mean he thinks it's less fun. Okay.\n\nI understand not wanting to feel blind sided but how do you go about bringing up and talking about issues in your relationship when they're not actually concrete problems to work on, but rather just the way things are? Unfortunately we are both not great communicators with him not bringing up any issue ever because \"it's not that bad\" and me mulling over things alone without including him in them. I am extremely physically attracted to him, he is a supportive partner who always tries to understand me and I don't want to end our relationship without giving it a good shot to see if we can work on this. Can these things be worked on and is it worth having a conversation about? If so how? (I already have therapy appointments set up for when I come back to talk to someone about why it's hard to by myself in romantic relationships)\n\nTL;DR: Differences between me and my boyfriend make me wonder if these are things I can bring up and that can be changed, or if we are simply incompatible. How do I bring them up, be open and honest, and really give our relationship a solid chance before deciding if it's better to end it?",

I\u2019m looking for advice on how to help her, myself, and my mom.\n\nFor some context, I was raised in a strict immigrant household with a strong emphasis on education and respect for elders. My parents worked a lot, so my older brother and I were raised mostly by ourselves. Now, both my brother and I are established in our careers\u2014he has a family, and I\u2019ve been able to travel and enjoy my time.\n\nMy sister just graduated high school, but the problems she\u2019s been facing have become overwhelming. She has had issues with staying up late (2-4am) even on school nights, and when she\u2019s up, she\u2019s loud in the bathroom, which is right across from my mom\u2019s bedroom. This has been going on for 4+ years and has only gotten worse.\n\nMy brother and I excelled in school\u2014top of our class, graduated with honors. My sister, however, has had serious academic struggles. Her GPA dropped so low that the school counselors contacted my parents, worried she might not graduate. She lies about her whereabouts, has been physically confrontational with me and my mom, and is overall rebellious.\n\nIt reached a point where the entire family got involved. My mom tried to set boundaries\u2014curfews, rules, checking her location\u2014but nothing worked. We tried speaking to her kindly, but she wouldn\u2019t change. When we set boundaries or curfews, she\u2019d run away for hours or even days, putting herself in danger.\n\nThe situation escalated when she\u2019d say she was at after-school activities or work, but would stay out until 12 AM. I\u2019m the primary support for my mom, as my dad works long hours and is rarely around. It\u2019s obvious that my mom and sister argue constantly, with my sister blaming my mom for everything. Eventually, my sister decided to cut off the entire family and live with her friends. This has yet to happen, but my mom is not doing well with this decision.\n\nI\u2019ve talked to her about the reality of living on her own, especially with tuition to pay, but it hasn\u2019t helped. What\u2019s worse is that I\u2019ve never seen my mom so stressed. Over the last few days, I\u2019ve spent 10 hours just listening to her and trying to support her emotionally.\n\nI\u2019ve decided to cut my sister out of my life because her behavior has caused too much pain for both me and my mom. Despite reasonable boundaries, she\u2019s pushed us to our breaking point, and I can\u2019t keep enabling her. My mom is still anxious about it, and the stress is beginning to take a physical toll on her as well. Nothing seems to get through to my sister even if I'm nice/mean emotional/logical, etc. \n\n**TL;DR** I\u2019m a 24-year-old second-generation immigrant and I\u2019ve cut ties with my rebellious 18-year-old sister due to her constant disrespect, academic struggles, and boundary-pushing behavior. Despite my mom\u2019s efforts to set boundaries, my sister\u2019s actions have caused emotional and physical stress in our family, and I\u2019ve reached a breaking point where I can\u2019t enable her anymore. I'm looking for advice on how to help my mom and myself cope with this situation.",

You and your brother managed to take care of yourself, but your sister needed more (Have you guys ever looked into what caused these academic struggles?) and your parents figured she'd do it herself like her siblings did. Then you get a person who doesn't believe a word of what her parent keeps telling her so she has no reason to make a change. That means the school of hard life lessons then. \n\nWhen she has a safe place to retreat to where your mom has no say, likely the relationship with your mom will improve over time. Mom has to be patient and graceful and find ways to manage her own stress. You should stick to being a sibling and not try to parent your sister with mom. It's very tempting, but at this moment mom is the enemy and you're mom's agent. So once you are back to sibling, there's a chance of that relationship changing eventually to positive too.",

I never hear from her when she\u2019s out of town and I let it slide since she\u2019s so much younger, and I appreciate that talking to her big sister might not be high on her social agenda. Whenever we do actually hang out we get we get on so well and I love her to pieces! \n\nSince she returned in April I\u2019ve seen her twice (she\u2019s not working by the way). Once to help set up our mum\u2019s small birthday party, and again to help clear the house a bit. No comms outside of this. \n\nShe replied with \u201chey!!! Sorry I\u2019ve been super busy and didn\u2019t see your text. Sorry I can\u2019t hang this weekend I\u2019m visiting my boyfriend or I totally would!\u201d (bf still at his uni in a different city). \n\nI\u2019d had it by this point so I replied with \u201cTwo weeks. There\u2019s busy, then there\u2019s just inconsiderate, especially when someone else is trying to make an effort. Everyone has stuff on but it takes 2 seconds to reply, even if you can\u2019t make it or to say you\u2019re not feeling 100%, which I\u2019d be understanding of. Have some courtesy.\u201d\n\nNo reply since (obviously).\n\nBut it\u2019s not just her. It\u2019s most people. It hurts because whenever we do speak properly, or meet up with these people it\u2019s lovely and we roar with laughter and they\u2019re all \u201cgosh it\u2019s crazy at the moment! I\u2019m so sorry it\u2019s been so long, but it\u2019s been amazing catching up!\u201d.\n\nThese are people I\u2019ve known YEARS (or my whole life!), and have had the deepest conversations with. I had to have an emergency appendectomy last year and they really showed up for me, and I\u2019ll be forever grateful. \n\nBut after that, back to usual. The most I usually get is a meme or funny clip sent to me. Not actually asking after me. I think I would feel unreasonable messaging them with \u201cI just feel sad, that whilst you\u2019re busy with a hormonal teenager and a toddler, and also work, and are working to stay on the wagon, that after all these years of friendship you don\u2019t take the time to text ME\u201d\u2026. \n\n\nI have a lovely encouraging partner, we live together and have pets and our own thing going on - so I\u2019m not twiddling my thumbs, but the resentment for others has just been building gradually.\n\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re thinking \u201cthey\u2019re just used to you messaging first!\u201d \u2026 but don\u2019t they want to know how I am if they haven\u2019t heard from me in a while? Or maybe you\u2019re thinking \u201cjust meet some new friends!\u201d. You\u2019re talking to the woman who doesn\u2019t like sports/outdoorsy stuff, games, cooking, crafting. Transparently, volunteering sounds like a hole in the head. Relaxing watching a good telly series is my preference. I work a very peopley job, and I\u2019m just not sure I have it in me to be Tour Guide Barbie with new people\u2026. But something has to change. \n\n\nI think I\u2019m going to test a month of not initiating contact and see what happens. I might laugh / heart react to a meme if it\u2019s sent\u2026 But unless it\u2019s a genuine question I won\u2019t reply.\n\nCare to weigh in? \n\nAny personal experience? \n\nPerhaps the opinion from someone who\u2019s guilty of forgetting to message friends? No hate.\n\nThank you",

This situation feels like you have expectations of others that aren't being met. You can't control other people but you can re-evaluate your expectations. \n\nI'm pretty bad at keeping in touch even with people I live close to. I have a tendency to put my phone away when I get home from work and then don't look at it until I go to sleep. Sometimes I'm just not in the mood to have a conversation. When we actually hang out it's always a good time but I don't expect my friends to check in with me with any sort of regularity. There are many weekends I'm wiped out from work and don't want to socialize at all. \n\nTo your point about not having many hobbies. I think this could be to your detriment in making plans as well. Sometimes I reach out to see if someone wants to go to a play or to an art fair. It helps to have a common activity that has a set time/place vs nebulous we should get together sometimes. \n\nBit of a ramble I hope this helps your perspective.",

Especially with her being a young adult.\n\nPeople get busy with new time commitments, or just wrapped up into their own lives. But it sounds like they showed up for you during a time when you needed them, and when you do make time for each other you really enjoy it. They care about you. \n\nI'd suggest for your closer people, reach out and tell them you understand they're busy, but you feel like you are usually the one reaching out, and you'd appreciate if they got in touch more often without you prompting. Frame this positively as \"I always love hearing from you.\"\n\nFor people who you're not as close to, you might just have to get used to the idea that the nature of those relationships is changing and decide whether you are willing to carry some extra weight in terms of initiating plans/contact in order to keep the friendship in a solid enough shape. I would imagine that for some people it seems worth it, and for others is does not.",

But when it comes to some friendships, not many are destined to last; some people who I considered to be great suddenly stopped having the interest in the friendship, so I had to let them go. So, you have to keep in mind that it is healthy to keep expanding your social circle, but also, there's the big possibility that you need to check in on the way you talk and the topics you like to discuss. I\u2019ve met some people in my life that I prefer to avoid, not because I considered them to be bad but because they are too negative. The topics they talk about are the same; you don\u2019t feel good talking with them, as if they have drawn some energy from you, and when the conversation ends, you feel relieved.\n\n\n\nSo, make the analysis of who you are and the way you talk.

I like to look at a calendar with people to see what might work in the next month or during the summer. Then there is a clearer picture of when you could get together. And maybe schedule a next meeting right then and there. \n\nBut I think you should also find some things to do on your own at the same time. Maybe group fitness, local sports, book clubs, summer reading programs. Something that you can look forward to as an individual and fill up more time.\n\nAll the best.",

        "text": "I\u2019m at a loss for what to do we have been in a relationship for almost 2 years and for every argument we have I\u2019m always the one who has to apologize every time and then there are times when she just blows up at me over the smallest of things\n\nFor example. One night I was putting up the dishes and she just blew up at me bc I had placed one in the wrong spot and it lead her to yell at me and kick me out the kitchen and said I don\u2019t want you in my sight and even threatens to end the relationship\n\nAnother example would be I work nights I go in at 3:15 am so I was sleeping n she was on the phone with her friend she was being a little loud I asked if she could be a little quieter and she was but I guess she got excited I woke up n then started to mess with me n tried to put a little piece of trash in my mouth n I said can you stop im trying to sleep then from there on she left n then yelled at me for being rude\n\nI know that sometimes it is my fault and I own up to it and try my best to make it up to her when it is but almost every time she hurts me or is rude to me I have to be the one to apologize it\u2019s gotten to the point where I start to get anxious just going to Costco with her as she has blown up at me so many times just going there bc I don\u2019t find parking fast enough or I\u2019m not grabbing the right thing\n\nI love this girl even after everything but there has been times where she has just hurt me beyond belief and Iv started to feel lost\n\nTL;DR I apologize even if it wasn't my fault and she is very defensive and doesn't like to admit it was her mistake.",

        "post-author": "yung2bunz",
        "text": "I\u2019m feeling so down today. And honestly for the last year. My partner and I fell in love pretty quickly. We would talk for hours and hours and even fall asleep talking to each other only to wake up and continue talking to each other before we went about our days. We\u2019re in a long distance relationship, but none of our issues have to do with the distance. After I broke agreements (that seemed minimal to me at the time, such as giving people I met my phone number [not because I am interested in them sexually or romantically, but because I like making connections and all times it was with people that he was friends with] but I was able to recognize that what doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal to me could be a big deal to him), and he decided to start acting out of integrity after (in ways that felt like a really big deal to me, but weren\u2019t to him such as sleeping with people and lying to me about what he was doing repeatedly when he was really with a hook up buddy. I\u2019m not telling Me about it on his own, but me having to find out] ), it seems like we are just both holding onto resentment. Even with resentment, I love him so much, and I show it to him constantly, and in ways that it seems he enjoys receiving. \n\nYet, I\u2019m constantly feeling ignored and not considered and unimportant to him. From things that I judge myself for caring about, like the fact that he likes every post this girl puts on Instagram ( he was crushing on throughout the whole beginning of our relationship and probably still now.) to the bigger things like him and validating my feelings and being defensive when I mention my feelings and him even questioning me and asking me to prove I bought a flight to see him before he expressed we shouldn\u2019t make trips to see each other again until we resolve issues he had with me (I bought it 1 week before that convo because I wanted to se shim for Valentine\u2019s Day). I\u2019ve been working so hard to communicate in a way that is not creating blame or defensive and taking accountability for my feelings. But I am met with harshness and anger and retaliation. It truly feels like he doesn\u2019t even like me sometimes. He\u2019s constantly correcting the way I talk the way I move through the world .And he\u2019s very quick to remind me when I\u2019m being defensive. \n\nI find that I take the time afterwards to reflect on how I show up and I own up to it and I\u2019m trying to change faster, but it\u2019s all moving on its own speed. Yet, my observation, is that he does not reflect on how he shows up and does not take accountability for it. It\u2019s very rare that he asks me about my day when he calls. The conversation is generally about him when I go visit him he sometimes ignores me and I\u2019ll just spend time playing video games by himself even if I ask if he wants to play a game together. \n\nRecently, when I visited him, I shared that I wanted attention and wanted to spend time with him because I was visiting him and I shared that I was hungry and he\u2019s known that I can\u2019t eat gluten since he started dating me over a year and a half ago and I mentioned that there was nothing without gluten in his apartment \u2026and his response was that I am the issue and that he forgot how difficult it is to be with me. And he\u2019s not thinking about eating because he\u2019s overwhelmed and feels he\u2019s in survival mode and he doesn\u2019t eat when he\u2019s in survival mode. \n\nIt just feels like I am going to be secondary in this relationship. I feel so alone when I\u2019m sitting with him in the same room. Compromise does not feel like something that\u2019s easy to come by. His needs are more important than mine. His feelings are more important than mine. I feel like I have been wanting to accept ending this relationship. He has stopped talking to me for weeks at a time throughout our relationship and will do it without telling me he is taking space. He has threatened to break up with me often\u2026he finally did in march this year and I was devastated, but he still continued to call me every day and talk to me and asked me to come see him as if nothing changed. \n\nRecently, his ex texted him while I was with him and he was showing me a reel, he tried to lie and say it was a different friend. He was visiting me on his birthday and I made a scavenger hunt that ended in a surprise party for him with all his friends in this city. The next day he told me he was going to leave and go hang out with people, but didn\u2019t want to tell me who it was because he felt like I was trying to take away his independence and he needed his sense of freedom. The next day is when his ex texted him asking if he was still asleep he swears that he didn\u2019t see her the night before when he wouldn\u2019t tell me where he was. When I was trying to end things, ensuring how I was feeling his first response was that he didn\u2019t want our friends to be influenced by something like this . It seemed to matter more about what they would think and then about my feelings . I told him that I can\u2019t do this anymore and he said he wanted this and he wanted to make our relationship official again and that he was committed to me and feels we have something real and he wants to hold onto that. \n\nBut his actions do not match his words. I feel like a shell of the woman I was before I met him. I love him very deeply, and I have a high threshold and tolerance for being mistreated. Also have a lot of patience due to the experiences I had in my childhood and upbringing. but it hurts to feel this way every day\u2026 to feel like I\u2019m not chosen. To feel like I\u2019m not considered. I\u2019m not sure what I even need or want and posting this, but I think I need an outlet aside from ChatGPT. Why am I holding onto these tidbits of love I receive from him. Pardon me judges myself because I want to love myself more. And then part of me thinks that it\u2019s just me.\u2014 I really am the problem and I should be grateful that anybody wants to be with me at all. And then another part of me rolls her eyes because this just feels like I\u2019m victimizing myself.\n\nTLDR: I feel unappreciated and unconsidered and exhausted in my relationship, but I love him so much that I stick around.",

        "text": "if anyone reads this, ily. My(22) boyfriend(24) and I met last year in April 2024. We were both doing an internship in the same city. We had a month-long rendezvous and it was a great time for both of us.  At the early stages of our dates we agreed that we didnt want a relationship because we would both be leaving in May 2024 back to our cities and didnt want to do long distance. Fast forward May 2024, when we're both back in our town, he wants to keep talking to me and we decided to be exclusive. He flies down to see me in June 2024 and we officially start dating August 2024 because I had moved back to our internship city which was only a 3 hour train ride to his city. It didnt feel like a long distance relationship because I would at least see him once a month for an extended amount of time because he has a remote job. I meet his family in September and he meets mine later on in November.\n\nAll is well until December, im catching up with a male friend who also did the same internship in the spring and knew him and I. When i mention to him that Im dating him his face changes and he warns me that hes not a good person. I ask why he says that he would cheat on his previous gf and he hooked up with a another girl in the spring. I confront my boyfriend about this in person the next day and he admits the cheating on his previous relationship and tells me all the details. Up until this point we had never spoken about each others pasts. I also ask him if there was any overlap with me and any other girl when we went on dates. i also ask if he slept w anyone else in the spring bc we had slept together and i wanted know. he denies and only says he kissed another girl in the spring but it was before he met me. I decide to believe him but explicitly said \"if i find out youre lying to me about any of this information im going to break up with you\" he agrees and we carry on.\n\nfast forward April 2025 i find out he was lying. he did sleep with another woman a day before our first date. I confront him about this detail and he confesses. he leaves the room for a few minutes, comes back, and proceeds to tell me that he also slept with another girl in May 2024, 2 weekends before we both went back to our hometowns. that weekend he told me we wouldnt be able to see each other because his cousins were coming into to town. (obv a lie) he says that the girl was from his hometown and he had split a hotel and scheduled all this a little before he met me.\n\nWell, when he told me this i stood on business and broke up with him. It was clear that he was hurt but he understood/respected my decision and agreed to go no contact with me. I broke no contact after 5 days. Its been a little over a month and we have been in contact and we are trying again because I genuinely do believe that he is remorseful and is changing. I told him that if we are going to get back together he's going to need to give me time and ask me out all over again. He understands that im more upset about the lie than the actual things he did when we were talking because we had both established that we didnt want anything more.\n\nOur relationship has been the best one i've ever had (despite the lying, yikes). i KNOW hes never cheated on me, hes always treated me right, yada yada yada. The only reason why I'm trying again is because I love this person. The only thing that has changed about how he treats me now is that hes  being very understanding and attentive to how im feeling about the situation and if i want to talk about it he talks about it with me. He is very sweet, attentive, and makes time to talk to me every day, which is literally how he would treat me throughout our relationship anyway. He has given me no doubt except for those lies. Not sure what to do since I do want to get back together with him but now im just starting to doubt him about random things.\n\nObviously im hurt about him lying and also grossed out about him hooking up w 2 different girls in the month that I first met him. The thing that is hard to move past is just the lying. I dont want to be in a relationship where im doubting things he tells me or second guessing things. Im not sure about what to do.\n\nTL;DR: I caught my boyfriend in a lie and I dont know if I should continue with him.",

        "text": "\nTl;dr my bf says he misses the thrill of falling in love \n\nHi so i need some advice. My boyfriend (19m) and i (18f) have been in a relationship for 8 months now. Since the moment we met it felt like we have known each other forever and we practically live together. We have a good balance between friends and our relationship. I've never met anyone who gets me the way he does and i've never resonated this much with a person. We both really value that we are able to understand each other well. Thus, we have many open and honest conversations. Recently, we were talking and he brought up the fact that he really misses the thrill of falling in love. How now everything is pretty calm in our relationship and he feels like its peaceful but also boring? He said he's felt like this for the month. He was talking about how he just really craves the honeymoon phase , the getting to know someone part all over again. He said he wants to fall in love with me again but im just unsure on what to do with this. I dont feel this way, i really like how peaceful our relationship is. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that he's been in relationships throughout his whole conscious life to be honest (since he was around 12) so he doesnt know what life being single is like, while i do. I dont want to feel like hes bored of me and he said its not an issue with me, just something with him. I get that its something he has to process himself but how? How can i help him? Anyways, im just really unsure on what to do. Has anyone gone through something similar? Thanks ahead!",

But sometimes relationships can grow stale if you let them. That's why people say that you need to \"keep the spark alive.\"\n\nI'm much older than you, but one thing I've learned is that so many people rely solely on that initial spark and chemistry to create intimacy and passion in their relationships. They never learn how to actually build it or create it.\n\nBut if you pay attention to each other, learn and grow and ask questions and put in effort, you can keep that excitement around for a long time. 8 months is a very, very short time to lose the spark. It suggests he was more in love with the idea of being in a relationship or the feeling of infatuation, than he is with actually building a relationship.\n\nTell him that it concerns you. Tell him that you hope he wants to build something more together and that it will take mutual effort. If he hems and haws, you need to move on and find something better for yourself. Go out and explore and learn about yourself. This is part of who he is right now. And either he needs to grow, or you need to accept the whole of him (both good and bad) and the consequences that comes with, or you need to move on and figure out what you want elsewhere.\n\nDo not compartmentalize the good (like people say \"but he's such a good guy\") from the bad.",

        "post-author": "Accomplished_Oven961",
        "text": "td;lr wife seems checked out but wants to stay. By sticking around, am I delaying the inevitable? \n\nMy wife (35F) and I (33M) went a on family vacation about 5 months ago, and while we were at the lodge, my family and I found ourselves in a smaller play room for kids and teens (we have four kids). In there was a tall, attractive, and muscular man (late 30s, early 40s). Because of the distance she kept from me while in there, the guy walked over while our kids were engaging, and he started playing with our youngest and tried flirtatious engaging my wife. She stepped away but then walk over to about 5 feet away from me and kept a cold distance. My gut immediately sank but I didn\u2019t mention anything. A few minutes later, we proceeded to the next planned event and while there, my wife broke off to take our youngest to get something to drink. She was supposed to come right back but instead headed back to the room. Her behavior felt odd. So I headed back to the room as well but needed to immediately take off because our food was ready for pick up. A few minutes, my wife, a very non-spontaneous woman, texted me saying she was heading back to the lobby to take our youngest to play. I called to confront her odd behavior. She called me crazy, insecure, etc. When I got back, I realized she changed her pants into legging that better show off her curves (at 7:30PM). Again, she said there was some stain, etc, etc. From my perspective, my wife kept trying to break away from us to catch a chance encounter. I kept explaining how I perceived her actions but she held her ground and continued to insult me.\u00a0\n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago, we had a huge fight because while she we was talking to me, she blatantly got distracted and started checking out some guy. After a long convo, she revealed that her ideal type has always been taller and muscular men, a bit older than her (late 30s, early 40s). I\u2019m 5\u20199 and she\u2019s 5\u20198, and she admitted that because I\u2019m not tall, she\u2019s aways felt embarrassed standing next to me, and whenever attractive men showed her attention in public, she pulled away from me because of the embarrassment. She feels a drop in pride standing next to me. Over our 18 year relationship, we\u2019ve always had connection issues because she\u2019s always kept me at distance; no vulnerability, emotional connection, intimacy, etc. She revealed it was because she always fantasied about \u201cthe one\u201d who match her ideal type, and because I wasn\u2019t that, she was never able to fully embrace me; further adding that she was never sexually and emotionally satisfied because of this.\n\nObviously I was crushed. She gaslit me for 5 month regarding the situation, and basically led me on for 18 years. She continued to share a lot more, and expressed that she never fully respected me, valued me, or appreciated me, because when we were younger, (I was 14 and she was 16), I chased her around no matter how much she tried to shake me. She cheated multiple times, and no matter what, I still chased her. I ended up leaning towards divorce and then connected with an attorney to follow through. My wife then completely flipped script to a whole new person. She became super vulnerable and embraced me like never before. She been in therapy for a year and just dropped her therapist for an experienced psychiatrist who focuses in therapy and these types of issues. She\u2019s like a whole new person who really wants to fix and discover themselves. She\u2019s pled and begged me to stay. I was completely determined to file for a divorce but even the attorney recommended I should wait it out and give her another chance. Any anyone here dealt with this type of stuff before? Did it work out or am I just delaying the inevitable. I have four kids with this woman, so I don\u2019t want to make a rash decision.",

        "text": "My [31F] relationship with my boyfriend [34M] of seven months feels emotionally surface-level. Most of our conversations feel like small talk, and whenever I try to go deeper, it feels like I hit a wall. I care about him a lot \u2014 he\u2019s kind, thoughtful, intelligent, and an animal lover like me \u2014 but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that something\u2019s missing.\n\nThis is one of the healthiest relationships I\u2019ve had in terms of consistency and stability. There\u2019s no drama, no mind games. But there\u2019s also no real passion or emotional intimacy. I haven\u2019t been in many relationships, so maybe this is just how most of them are? Still, half a year in, I feel like there should be more emotional depth \u2014 real conversations about what moves us, inspires us, challenges us. Instead, it feels like we\u2019re stuck on the surface.\n\nI know my boyfriend\u2019s favorite food and color, but I don\u2019t know what truly drives him. I don\u2019t know what keeps him up at night or lights him up inside. I wish I could be okay with staying in the shallow end, talking about errands and weather and work \u2014 but I crave depth. I want to talk about art, spirituality, inner worlds.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to initiate those conversations, but his responses are often short or vague, and I\u2019m left carrying the weight of trying to connect.\n\nTL;DR My relationships lacks depth. \n\nAm I asking for something unrealistic?\n\n",

Something I realized about the situation and why it was painful was because I was this deep person and wanted to be deeply known, but his surface level approach to life meant that he never dug deeper with me. It felt like there were whole parts of me he didn't know and didn't have curiosity for.\n\nWhat ended up happening was that we went through some really hard things together. It brought up a lot of painful conflict, but by slowly working through that conflict it seemed to open a depth to the relationship that wasn't there before. Some of my husband's surface level stuff was happening because he lacked skills for managing strong and painful emotions and he avoided them by never digging deep or taking the time to look inside. The nature of our conflict basically gave him the choice of immersing himself in this emotional world for the sake of the relationship or part ways and keep the status quo. He chose to dig deep.\n\nOne thing I will say about my work in our relationship is that I needed to learn to lighten up sometimes. Not everything needs to be serious, deep, or analyzed. What I've discovered is that there is a whole realm of intimacy that comes from playfulness that I was ignoring because I was comfortable with the \"deep\" stuff. My husband was good at meeting me with fun and lightheartedness and I had to grow some skills for letting things go and being goofy. My initial reactions of feeling like that was immature were actually my own immaturity.",

You don't have to be willing to wait for that deeper connection to flourish or to make that compromise if you don't want to, but seven months might not be enough time for some more reticent people to open up in the way you're hoping.

                        "body": "Sweadle! It's got to be said...This is such a brilliant, emotionally intelligent, and compassionate answer. You've even helped give me some clarity on similar interpersonal barriers I've been experiencing with my Boomer parents who I love very much. While OP is talking about an intimate relationship, I totally feel her pain about things being very surface level.\u00a0\n\n\nI feel so\u00a0shut down and shut out whenever something difficult comes up ie in my case, serious illness. It's like there's a sense of \"if we don't talk about it, it's not real\". We used to be able to talk about anything and everything years ago but it's gotten so painfully surface level. I yearn for the deep connnection we once had. I feel the stiff upper lip, brave faced, stoic upbringing of the Boomer generation has a lot to do with their inability to talk about things like illness and uncertainties, what eachother fears or yearns for. This may have been considered \"strong and brave\" in the past but to me it's a recipe for things such as major depression. It's unhealthy and harmful to keep these things bottled up - for them and their loved ones.\u00a0\n\n\nOP, I agree with Sweadle in that if your partner is limited to surface level talk, it doesn't bode well for longevity of the relationship. A healthy relationship should feel like a safe haven to talk about individual and mutual goals and aspirations. But ALSO to feel you can turn to eachother to discuss difficult things which can occur in ANY relationship ie change of circumstance such as illness, loss of income, grief etc.\u00a0\n\n\nOP, my advice is similar to Sweadle's.\u00a0 Don't waste time hoping for change or attempting to prise him open. That will only lead to deep seated resentment at both ends. He has told you this is who he is. You either need to accept you're both wired differently OR move on. There's a lid for every pot if you give yourself the chance to find one. In my experience, the \"finding\" happens when you're enjoyinh the things which really light you up whether it be sports, hiking, photography, volunteering etc. Someone like Sweadle would be perfect! \ud83d\ude09",

I thought he needed help, encouragement, a safe space, modeling how to do it. No, that's just who he is. \n\nAnd I no longer bring things to him that require more than a surface level conversation. It makes me sad because I feel like that's such a limited way to live life, but it's his life to live, not mine.",

We want to understand people, the world, the mind, the soul. We want conversations that move something in us. That build intimacy beyond the surface.\n\nI\u2019m a man and I\u2019m wired that way too. But funny enough, my wife\u2019s the opposite. She lives in her bubble, focused on the kids, the house, work. Anything deeper just feels like extra weight to her. She\u2019s told me straight up, she doesn\u2019t have the time or energy to go there. She finds peace in the simple things. In a way, I don\u2019t blame her. The world is heavy. And sometimes I wish I could live in that space too. I envy her bubble some days.\n\nBut I feel things deeply. I think deeply. I miss those conversations where you lock eyes with someone and you know they want to explore your thoughts. Where you feel seen. Curious. Pulled in. That kind of connection hits different.\n\nSo if this is what you\u2019re craving, you\u2019re valid for it. But try starting small. Ask him things that don\u2019t feel like pressure. Things like:\n\n- \u201cWhat part of your day made you feel something?\u201d\n\n- \u201cWhat\u2019s a memory that shaped you?\u201d\n\n- \u201cIf money wasn\u2019t a factor, how would you live?\u201d\n\nMake it casual. Share something first. Keep it light but open. See how he responds. Some people aren\u2019t used to opening that part of themselves, but they can if they feel safe doing it. And if he won\u2019t or can\u2019t meet you there after time and effort, that\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to face.\n\nJust know, it\u2019s not about you being too much.

We\u2019ve had our ups and downs, and this need for deeper connection was part of that.\n\nAt first, I found myself having those kinds of deep talks with other people. Sometimes other women, which I\u2019ll admit was a slippery slope I had to learn the hard way. Those convos build connection without you even realizing it. Once I saw what was happening, I stopped that and tried to bring it home instead.\n\nIt didn\u2019t click right away. I\u2019d start talking and she\u2019d shut down or brush it off. But I stayed consistent. I shared little things without expecting much. Over time, she started letting me talk, and now I do see that spark in her eye. That quiet curiosity. She doesn\u2019t fully jump into those conversations, and she still tells me she doesn\u2019t have the mental space for it, between the kids, work, and life, but she\u2019s listening now. That means something.\n\nWhat helped me stay sane was building a circle of close friends. Once or twice a week, after the kids are down and everything\u2019s settled, I\u2019ll go have a coffee or hang out at a cafe with people who think deep like me. Just space to talk and breathe. It\u2019s helped me a lot, and in a weird way it\u2019s helped things at home too. I don\u2019t carry that weight the same way anymore. I get it out in healthy ways, and I still come home grounded.\n\nSo yeah, it was a tradeoff in some ways. But we made it work with time, patience, and real effort on both sides.",

There\u2019s something about being that mix of grounded and curious, with a mind that doesn\u2019t stop unfolding.\n\nMy wife\u2019s loving and thoughtful in her own way. She checks on me, asks how work is, wants to know if I\u2019m okay. And I appreciate that. But to me, it still feels like the shallow end. I want to talk about how we got here as a society. How we raise strong and kind kids. How we lead with purpose. How we protect each other from the division and the noise out there. I want to sit in conversations that build something real.\n\nShe\u2019s not into that and tells me she doesn\u2019t have the mental space for it. We come from different cultures. Different religions. She\u2019s not political. She finds peace in simplicity. And I\u2019ve learned to respect that. Where she doesn\u2019t meet me in depth, she shows up in loyalty, love, and stability.\n\nThat\u2019s where the 90 and 10 comes in for me.

I have multiple male and female friends who I discuss life with and I love throwing around ideas. I realised I had not been getting this from my partner when I connected with a friend over a good chat and felt relief to express that part of me. \n- my partner is female and we are from different cultures (although similar enough, but her culture values emotional restraint). \n- my partner is loyal, kind, caring and at her heart a good person. She is intelligent (in a logical, can get things done kind of way) and a beautiful person. She is also not as deep a thinker as I am and I don't believe has cultivated friendships or relationships in her life which value deep discussion. \n\nWe are only a 6 months into \"officially\" dating having known each other for about 18months total.\n\nI could go further but I'll hold that as an overview.

You gotta figure out if that works for you or not. For me, it does. Because in so many ways, she is everything else I would want. I can compromise here because I have friends I meet up with once or twice a week to talk and explore the things that matter to me. She doesn\u2019t block that. She\u2019s not jealous or controlling.

Since you mentioned he's an animal lover, maybe ask about a past pet and why he loved them so much?\n\nAlso realize that a person who is on a very even keel isn't prone to being passionate. That's not to say that the two are always mutually exclusive but maybe his consistency is a product of not being affect by things.\n\nThe other thing to think about it maybe it just hasn't been long enough. Maybe his life hasn't changed much during the time you've been together. When he goes through a bigger life event, maybe you will see some indications of where his passions lie. For example, if he gets laid off from his job, then you might see he is more passionate about his work than you realized (or hopefully it is something positive that happens; that is just the first example that popped into my head).",

While 6 months feels like a long time, I think it is still reasonable for still exploring the surface level. Sometimes it takes people (who are not used to these conversations or mental exercise) to actually consider what you are talking about and apply it to themselves. \n\nAlso, sometimes people are very physical/present (like out-of-sight-out-of-mind), meaning they will talk about art after visiting a museum, or talk about comedy after seeing a show, or discuss their philosophical ideas after watch a doco on socrates, or talk about their ambition after going to a local 'ted talk'. \n\nI would consider trying to do some experiences together about a deep thing you are interested rather than theoretical discussion. It may provide a 'break through' for your communication. Or it will help you to evaluate and decide on the mismatch. \n\nIf you read r/askmen you'll see complaining about how men often can't open up to their GF about anything because they will use it later in a crushing argument to hurt them. This seems to be quite a common experience. Perhaps this is also playing a role and he has been 'trained' not to actually share his thoughts. You may have to have a straight discussion about wanting to be deeply known, and wanting to know him deeply. And that you want to build trust around not using those inner thoughts as ammunition in the future (ask how to make that trust).\n\nI remember having to speak with my boyfriend about our discussions of issues. He would present the argument from the video/presenter we had watched, I would present my personal view. I wanted to know what HE thought, not what the video/speaker said. I don't even think he realised what he was doing, but he has changed his communication style and our talks are better now.\n\nAnyway, just some thoughts here. I would give him some more time, but I think boring is a valuable relationship feature (feels reliable and comfy) that acts as a good baseline. Makes it somewhat easy to shake things up! \n\nBest of luck!",

Ask open ended questions so you can better understand if he is willing to work on this or not. \n\nIf he's fine with how things are or gets defensive or tries to say you are asking for too much. Then I would recommend breaking up. \n\nJust being this relationship is healthier than ones in your past, doesn't make it healthy or right for you.

        "text": "I, 15F, have been in a talking stage with 15M, for about seven months, and I\u2019m scared and don\u2019t know how to end it. He initially reached out to me over Instagram, because he wanted to get to know me, as we did go to the same school. This was about in October and we had a solid relationship until about December. Something about me, is that I really prioritise my time and I don\u2019t like getting interrupted during that time, so around that time, every time hed message me I\u2019ll get super annoyed and I just didn\u2019t really want to reply\u2014 additionally I am someone who doesn\u2019t text often so I\u2019m not used to texting a lot or having extensive conversations online.\n\nIn late December, I gave him a long text clearly explaining my reasonings and thanking him for the time together and everything. I should also add, we were also really scared of each other- like talking in real life so we never really talked during our talking stage during that time excluding one or two small interactions. The other worst part is this is about three days after he had sent me a long text confessing his feelings and his hopes for our relationship in the future.\n\nFast forward to about April, and I hear that he still likes me, and honestly I still miss him at the time as well, so we started talking. A month later in March, we\u2019ve been talking since then, and also our birthdays were both in May. So for his birthday, I got him a burr basket and just around last week, we finally had the longest interaction, and the first time we went out together into the CBD- where he also gave me my late birthday gift. The problem arises is that if I was to give another paragraph again, it\u2019ll be the second time, and it\u2019s also very abrupt and sudden just like last time, as I haven\u2019t really changed my style of talking, im not dry, and I\u2019m still regularly texting him. I would like to emphasise again, how awkward it would be to send another paragraph on ending things ,because of how sudden and abrupt it was. It\u2019d be completely out of the blue for him- again. I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship which I\u2019m forcing myself to be in, nor do I want to be leading someone on and being fake, so what is the best course of action I should take, or how should I deal with this? Sorry bad grammar, its pretty late rn. \nTLDR: So how do I end a talkingstage without making it awkward due to past experiences with the person?\nThanks",

You\u2019re a great guy but I\u2019m not in the right place for anything serious right now. We\u2019re both young and still figuring things out. I\u2019d like to stay friends if that\u2019s okay. At the same time, I\u2019m going to start setting some boundaries and pull back a bit so we can both have some space. I am still here for you as a friend, we just need to take a few steps back and work on being friend\u2019s. Thanks for understanding.\u201d\n\nThen just start pulling back a bit on your responses. Give yourself some time before replying. Let him see that you\u2019re not always available. He\u2019ll naturally match your energy and start to respect those boundaries. This way you\u2019re being honest without making things awkward.",

        "text": "I\u2019ve been talking to this girl since the beginning of the year. The thing is she\u2019s exactly the kind of woman I\u2019ve always said I wanted. She has the mentality mindset values, everything I\u2019ve been looking for. She\u2019s mature understanding and emotionally grounded.\n\nBut while we\u2019ve been talking I ended up falling for someone else someone I eventually broke up with. After that I was seeing another girl. And now I\u2019m here realizing that I don\u2019t actually have real feelings for this first girl I\u2019ve been talking to for so long.\n\nAnd it\u2019s killing me because I want to love her. I want to focus only on her. She\u2019s loyal she genuinely loves me, she\u2019s obsessed with me in the best way and even her whole family knows about me. She traveled a long way just to meet me and I finally saw her in person for the first time recently.\n\nI\u2019ve done things for her. I\u2019ve bought her gifts and tried to show that I care. I\u2019ve been trying to build something real with her. But it still doesn\u2019t feel like it did with other girls. With past relationships I\u2019ve felt the spark the butterflies the excitement and I don\u2019t feel that here.\n\nTo be completely honest I\u2019ve dated women in the past who were very beautiful and she\u2019s not as beautiful to me. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s shallow or wrong but I can\u2019t lie and say it doesn\u2019t affect me. I wish it didn\u2019t but maybe it\u2019s part of why I\u2019m struggling to feel something deeper.\n\nI was hoping something would change when we finally met in person but it didn\u2019t. I still didn\u2019t feel the attraction or the emotional pull I was hoping for. And I hate this because she deserves love. She deserves someone who\u2019s crazy about her. She\u2019s done everything right and I still feel empty.\n\nI feel stuck. I don\u2019t want to hurt her. I don\u2019t want to break up with her. I\u2019m scared of how it\u2019ll affect her and what her family will think. But how can I stay in something when I don\u2019t feel what I know I should?\n\nIs it possible for love to grow over time? Can you choose to love someone and eventually feel what\u2019s missing? Or am I just trying to force something that isn\u2019t there?\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I really need some honest advice.\n\nTL;DR: Been talking to a girl for months who is \nperfect on paper and loves me deeply. Finally met her in person and felt no spark or attraction. I\u2019ve dated girls I was more physically attracted to and feel guilty that it matters. I want to love her but I don\u2019t and I don\u2019t know if I ever will. Should I stay and hope the feelings come or end it now?",

        "post-author": "VXiaoHan",
        "text": "TLDR: Should I end my relationship with no romantic spark that I\u2019ve realised I\u2019ve been staying in out of guilt? Or is it still possible to revive the relationship?\nAnd if so, should I break up after exam season or ASAP, given that going on a break isn\u2019t an option?\n\nI\u2019ve been dating my girlfriend for nine months, and known her for basically a year. Back then, when she confessed to me, I didn\u2019t really know much about love. But I still wanted to try things out and see where things would go, even though I only valued her as a friend.\n\nI wasn\u2019t someone who liked looking into the future, but her kindness and her constant gifts made me feel really valued, and she eventually became one of the only people I could be weird and stupid in front of and still love me for who I was.\n\nAlthough everything seemed good during our honeymoon phase, I always had a weird feeling that something was off. For the whole time, I was searching for a spark in our relationship, but that spark never came. We did many things that couples would, and yet it didn\u2019t feel intensely romantic. I also realised I never truly appreciated her gifts and her being there for me; it only just hit me now.\nShe was anxiously attached to me; she would constantly shower me with love and affection. It seemed fine at first, but after some time, it started tiring me. \nI never broke up with her because it feels like fixing what we have would hurt less than breaking up. It did work, though, I guess. Every problem we had, we resolved it in the end, and she would grow as a person. And now she went from a loner who hated everyone to someone who has a huge friend group and liked everywhere around college. Our relationship always seemed to strengthen after each argument, but our core incompatibilities still remain.\n\nShe was already anxiously attached from trauma from her childhood, and my indifference to her sometimes is definitely not doing her any good. It\u2019s at the point where she starts monitoring me whenever I go out, being cautious if I\u2019m near any girls. Every time she senses distance, she showers me with affection. \nShe\u2019s not good at communicating either - I have a huge tendency to overthink, and she only ever tells me the problem when I have to ask her persistently. Normally, she never tells me what the problem is. This means every time she starts being \u201coff\u201d, I start to overthink and ask her a bunch of questions to get to the root of the problem (I realise this is also partly my own problem, but her communication style doesn\u2019t exactly help, and it\u2019s hard for her to openly communicate despite many arguments about this).\nI also realised that the time I cried out of \u201clove\u201d for her, it was just out of pure guilt. The love that she had shown me and the fact that I couldn\u2019t reciprocate it keeps feeding my guilt, so I just kept on letting her love and affection chain me in the relationship so I could prove to myself that I could love her like she loves me.\n\nAt this point in the relationship, it seems like I\u2019ve reached a kind of stable point where there aren\u2019t as many ups and downs. I\u2019ve subconsciously searched for reasons to break up with her for a long time, and now I\u2019m kind of mentally checked out. Every time we argue nowadays feels draining to the point I just want to break up, but I convince myself I\u2019m overreacting. \n\nIt\u2019s just hard to let her slip away when she\u2019s one of the only people who truly love me for who I am. We can act however we want around and we still never judge each other - and we could always smile and have a bunch of fun.  It\u2019s eating away at my self-esteem too. I feel like I\u2019ve absolutely failed this relationship. \nMy birthday is coming up and she has gifts for me, which just feels pointless if I\u2019m going to break up with her. Another part of me is telling me to continue the relationship, because although I\u2019m not IN love with her, I still love her, and maybe I just haven\u2019t been trying hard enough.\n\nI have important exams that will end in about two weeks, and I\u2019m struggling with what to do. I can\u2019t go on a break with her because I had already tried it. Should I try to end it now before my birthday gifts, or should I receive them and wait until after the exams and sort it out afterwards?",

It really is as simple as saying, \"I've enjoyed our time together, but this relationship isn't working for me anymore and we need to break up.\" And then you deal with the uncomfortable feelings and get through it.",

        "text": "I (30m) have a female friend (37) I\u2019ve known for quite a while, but over the past few months, our bond grew deeper and more intense. We talked about almost everything and felt really comfortable with each other.\n\nWe recently went on a two-week vacation together. At first, everything felt like normal friendship to me, but I soon noticed a shift \u2013 something between us started to feel different. There was a tension in the air, something unspoken. We spent a lot of time together, I made her laugh a lot, we drank together, had deep conversations. There were no explicitly romantic signs, but she didn\u2019t shy away from physical closeness either.\n\nFor example, during a long bus ride, we sat right next to each other, touching shoulders and legs the entire time. She could\u2019ve moved away but didn\u2019t. That kind of proximity just didn\u2019t feel like pure friendship to me. Then again, there were also moments where she seemed more distant \u2013 sometimes saying she needed a \u201cbreak\u201d because the trip felt overwhelming (to be fair, it was quite packed and intense). In the end, she even flew home two days earlier than planned.\n\nEspecially during the last days of the trip, it felt like the emotional tension between us peaked. Nothing ever happened physically, but I had to seriously hold myself back \u2013 which is unusual for me (I am usually more of a coward in this situations). On the last night before she left, she stayed up drinking and talking with me far longer than she originally intended.\n\nAfter she went to sleep, I texted her and told her honestly that I liked her \u2013 not in a pushy way, just openly. The next day, she replied that for her it\u2018s only friendship. That hit me really hard.\n\nThe contact afterwards felt odd. Sometimes she replied like everything was normal, sometimes not at all (though I know she has ADHD, which might explain some of the inconsistency). Eventually, I suggested we talk in person again.\n\nDuring that talk, I asked her if she really never felt anything between us. She said no \u2013 for her, it had always been friendship. She also told me she\u2019s currently emotionally focused on someone else \u2013 a guy she\u2019s been seeing for a while now and with whom she\u2018s in a kind of open relationship. She has a very avoidant attachment style and seems emotionally blocked in many ways.\n\nAfter that, I sent her one final message. I told her I respected her answer and didn\u2019t blame her \u2013 but that it had hurt me deeply, and I wasn\u2019t sure I could continue the friendship as it was. Her tone had been very distant and emotionally detached, and that really added to the pain. She never responded to that message.\n\nNow I\u2019m stuck here feeling lost, confused, and unsure what really happened \u2013 what it meant to me, what it meant to her (if anything), and whether there\u2019s any future at all for our connection.\n\nTL;DR:\nI went on a two-week trip with a close friend (f) and developed feelings. We had a lot of emotional and physical closeness, but she said it was \u201cjust friendship\u201d for her. After I opened up to her, she became distant and eventually stopped replying. I\u2019m confused and hurt, and don\u2019t know how to move on or whether a friendship is still possible.\n",

        "text": "Is toxic to healthy possible and how do I tell my family now that they don\u2019t want me with this person? \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wanting to lay everything on the table and get advice from outsiders. I\u2019m a 29F, single mom, 9 year old son. My ex is a 29M. \n\n**TLDR** we were unhealthy broke up for 6 months and now things feel better. How do I tell my family? \n\nWhen we first started seeing each other 5 years ago, we were both in stages of our lives where we were drinking a lot and sort of in \u201cparty scenes\u201d. I wasn\u2019t a single mom at the time, my son\u2019s dad was very involved in his life. (My sons dad and my ex are two different people - just to clarify)\n\nMy ex and I were just unhealthy. We both had traumas from our childhoods that triggered each-other. Things I did triggered him and things he did triggered me. Our communication was HORRIBLE and I never felt heard, understood or seen by him. He would often criticize me (I seem to have some kind of pull towards men that don\u2019t think I\u2019m enough, gotta love daddy issues). I felt manipulated by him in a way that he would say what I wanted but actions didn\u2019t usually reflect through over time: We also have extremely different attachment styles, I\u2019m a fearful avoidant and run fast as fuck any time my nervous system doesn\u2019t feel safe. He\u2019s an anxious attachment and just wants to fix fix fix everything right then and there. \n\nIn the beginning we had some trust issues not because he cheated but because I was ready for commitment way before he was and the first year-2 years of our relationship didn\u2019t feel like we were actually together. He wasn\u2019t cheating or seeing anyone else, but he liked girls photos, did things that made me feel like his eyes wandered. That created a dynamic where I didn\u2019t trust, wanted to run but still felt so safe and comfortable with him and was basically running off the \u201cidea\u201d of us. \n\nOver time, I would run, he would chase and fix and we did that on repeat for 5 years. Lots of criticism and manipulation to keep me around, I didn\u2019t feel like he even actually liked who I was at my core but liked the idea of me being his. My family and friends hated seeing what I became.\n\nI gained a bunch of weight and became super depressed and my nervous system was an absolute wreck. Very triggerable, very unwell. \n\n6 months ago, we split. I had done quite a bit of research on healing and nervous system regulation and was so done feeling like I was just completely drained in the relationship that is supposed to be my most intimate connection. \n\nI lost a bunch of weight, started writing again, meditating, eating right, going to the gym and regulating my system through mindfulness and awareness. I feel my mindset and lifestyle has completely shifted and I actually feel like I can see clearly and feel like myself again. \n\nNow for the kicker - we just reconnected recently. He\u2019s been in therapy, his words and actions are making me feel more seen, understood and valued than ever before. I don\u2019t wanna be a broken record and be like \u201cthis time feels different\u201d because I can\u2019t even count how many times I\u2019ve said that. But thus far, he\u2019s been 1000 times more patient with me as far as  making sure I\u2019m ok with reconnecting, he\u2019s constantly speaking to my value as a woman and I can tell he\u2019s truly taking the time to understand me when I\u2019m explaining how I feel to him (something he didn\u2019t do before), he\u2019s validating me and what feels even safer, is he\u2019s leading me through my big emotions. He understands my attachment style and is putting in effort to make sure I feel safe even if that means running for 10 minutes when something makes me feel uneasy. I feel like he\u2019s making space for me in ways he didn\u2019t before and in return it feels like it\u2019s opening doors for me to heal. I\u2019ve been much more willing to communicate and acknowledge ways I need to grow or things I\u2019m doing wrong and I feel like I\u2019m being led into a phase of healing I\u2019ve never seen in partnership. He just feels so much more mature and healed and aware. When problems are coming up, we are pausing and working THROUGH them in a way we never have. We meeting in the middle like it\u2019s us against the issue vs us against each-other like we did in the past. On top of it all, my son is so happy he\u2019s back in our lives. \n\nI\u2019m feeling nervous to even tell my family and friends, they care so much for me and they\u2019ve watched me run in loops with this man. I\u2019m also fearful that there is manipulation happening and he\u2019s just doing/saying all of this until I\u2019m comfortable and then things will go back to how they were. I\u2019m trying my best to keep my eyes clear but in the moment it\u2019s easy to be blinded by how much you care for someone. \n\n*** I just want to put it out there too that there was never any cheating or physical abuse in our relationship*** our toxicity was on both ends and we were always so wrapped up in our own emotion that we didn\u2019t make time for the other persons.  he would never lay a hand on me and I\u2019ve always felt very very physically safe with him, it was emotionally that I didn\u2019t feel safe.

In the past you know that his actions have not always backed up his words. That was a dynamic that you were able to pick up on over a timeline of several years. I worry that in the short time since you've been back together, he is selling things with his words, and I don't know that his actions will back that up over the course of the long-term.\n\nIt sounds like things were pretty bad before. I think there's a world in which he is *way* better, but still not a good enough fit with you to be a great long-term partner. I think you should keep that possibility in mind as you explore reconnecting. And I think that while things are good right now, you should come up with some past behaviours that you saw or dynamics you had with him that, if they pop up again in the future, you would choose to end the relationship. And then you should follow through if those things come up.\n\nIn terms of talking to your family about this, something that may be useful is to express that you understand what was happening before was not healthy, and that you both have been putting in work on yourselves and are only going to stay together if things can actually be healthy. Ultimately that will not ease their concerns that much in the moment - the real thing that will ease their concern is seeing a consistently healthy relationship between you two over a longer timeline.",

I also just feel that I'm not good for him, even if he says things are okay. I've been having less energy to hang out/spend time together even when I know how much he wants to. I hadn't been with anyone for over a year before him, but my previous relationship had been long and I had been ready to spend the rest of time with that person, and I feel guilty that I don't feel the same way with my current bf - there isn't anything he's done to prompt this, and I know I haven't been with him for as much time, but I don't like that I am having second thoughts even if it is early on.\n\nI have been having a rough time with mental health/gender dysphoria recently so I don't know if I'm just having a tough time and being down on everything or if I truly am unsure and I don't want to make any big decisions that I might regret, but I also don't want to be stuck with these thoughts of \"do I really want this\" because I feel horrible about them. I don't want to hurt this guy because genuinely he doesn't deserve that but I also don't want to lead him on in any way and I feel stuck. Also, with the way I felt before our relationship I don't like the thought that im having that maybe i only said yes to him because i was feeling lonely at the time. I would usually talk about something like this with my friends but they're friends with him too and I don't want them to form any type of view on our relationship so I'd rather do this and be anonymous. I want to speak to them when I'm more sure of how I feel\n\ntl;dr - I'm not sure if I want to be with my boyfriend anymore after a few months together and idk what to do",

Since Christmas my feelings have been hurt every now and then. I'm a person who appreciates little details but perceives every little change on connection, how he talks to me, manners, etc. He didn't have anything for me on Christmas and lied saying my present was coming but never arrived any package. On February 14th we had dinner together, fine. I waited until my birthday and he gave me a little sanrio plush that it wasn't my fav character, which is so obvious if you pay 5% of attention. His excuse is that he has no money, but I have never saw him without his tobacco or maria since I know him.\n I saw him expending money on videogames and then he tells me he doesn't want to go on a walk because \"he has no money for a coffee\"... \n\nHe's being rejecting me for months and only having relations like on Christmas or my birthday.  Saying I'm not the problem, that he doesn't feel well and has no desire... That makes me feel so bad and insecure with myself. \n\nSays he loves me but hardly talks to me via WhatsApp or see each other on weekends even he does anything at all during the week. I see him depressed but he doesn't want to talk to me about it and rejects going to therapy. His words doesn't resemble with his actions and viceversa. I feel so lost, angry and sad because after talking about it several times he doesn't change. He doesn't take care of me as I do.\n\n\nI would love to see him as he was at the beginning or a better version of himself. What should I do to get that outcome? Should I wait any longer? \n\n**TL;DR;** : I'm talking about the problems on my relationship (F30, M31) and asking for advice on how should I go through it.",

As someone who has battled feeling alone, even in a room of people, learning to cope and find healthier ways to address my emotions and feelings of abandonment have been aided by having a long-distance partner, because I have had to learn to not rely on them and to rely on myself to soothe myself and love myself more. \n\nYou shouldn't stay in this relationship cause it sounds like she is on her way out of it already, but you shouldn't be in any romantic relationship until you start doing some work. It took finding platonic friends that loved me while I was going through the early stages of healing before I got to the point where I could have a healthy romantic relationship and continue to address my issues and heal. Those friendships created stability and 5 because they are friends and not partners, they created a healthy boundary of not entirely relying on them to be all my emotional support, as people often do with romantic partners.

Then once you\u2019re locked into being his girlfriend, true colors start to get revealed and they aren\u2019t ideal nor what you expected.\n\nI know 11-months can feel like a long time, but in the grand scheme of things you two are still a pretty fresh couple. In my opinion, things should still be exciting for you both at this time in terms of your sex life, dates, etc. \n\nIt sounds like you already have tried speaking with him on these matters, but I\u2019d let him know how you\u2019re feeling, clearly and while you\u2019re both in a good place (aka not while fighting). \n\nAlthough you should not have to keep reiterating what you probably expressed to him in the beginning of your relationship how you expect to be loved, I think it\u2019s okay to remind him how you feel about it all once more and give some form of ultimatum. If he can\u2019t meet your expectations then you may need to part ways. I feel for you because it seems like you\u2019re loving too much and not wanting to give up on him where he seems to be giving up on him and you in his own way.",

He says he loves you but love without effort, presence or consistency can feel empty. You have been patient, open, and clear about your needs, but he has not responded with meaningful change.\n\nIt is not about gifts or grand gestures rather it is about care, attentiveness and emotional presence. If he has money for his own habits and hobbies but not for a coffee let alone a thoughtful gift, that shows his priorities. And if he is emotionally withdrawing while refusing help or support you are left feeling disconnected and rejected without a way forward.\n\nYou can not change someone who does not want to change. It is good to support a partner who is struggling but you also need to be met halfway. A relationship should not leave you feeling constantly unseen or insecure.\n\nWhat you can do is first have one final honest conversation letting him know how deeply this is affecting you and that if nothing changes, you can not keep investing your time and love into something one-sided. Second, set a clear boundary, give yourself a realistic time frame and observe if his behaviour aligns with what he says. Third, focus on your self-worth, remind yourself that you deserve a relationship where love feels safe, mutual and consistent. Fourth, be prepared to walk away if things remain the same, leaving is not giving up, it is choosing yourself.\n\nYou deserve more than waiting around for someone to remember how to love you. You deserve someone who wants to show up for you every day, not just on holidays and not just in words.\n\nYou have got this (even though it'll be hard) \ud83d\udc9b\n\n\n*People kindly take note, do not take relationships (of any kind - if it is decent), love, feelings, emotions and thoughts for granted. And secondly do not be a jerk to your partner (if they are decent and loving).",

If he\u2019s having a hard time or is stressed or worried about something and you don\u2019t know what it\u2019ll take a toll on your relationship. A lot of men don\u2019t like talking about their problems as they think it\u2019s not \u201cmanly\u201d to do so. My bfs like that too but overtime he\u2019s warmed up and come out of his shell. It makes a great difference. I\u2019m not big on giving up but fighting for the relationship. Start by talking communicating and getting to understand each other and if things don\u2019t improve and you don\u2019t see actions matching words, sit down and ask yourself is that what u really want. Don\u2019t worry about ur age or timing in life, you\u2019d rather be happy and content rather than just settle.",

        "post-author": "Dismal_Researcher_48",
        "text": "This is gonna be a long one, so buckle up..\n\nI met my partner in 2022 at work, we\u2019ve been good colleagues but I was always into him and thought I would ask him out, cause why not. He thought I had a boyfriend which is why he has never approached me. Since our first date, we\u2019ve been unseparable. We were doing everything together, worked the same shift at work so we basically had same schedules. For year and a half, I felt with him like I am on drugs. The kind of love and affection that people see in movies, not in real life. I was so in love with how he treated me, how he looked at me, how he was always interested in me. If I wanted a necklace, he suprised me with it. I talked about apple watch, and in 2 weeks I got it.. But not only the material stuff, his whole attention was on me. Long story short, a perfect relationship. He also has a 10 year old son, who he has every second weekend and those weekends were spent going on trips, and adventures with his son. I was very open to this, was welcoming of his son eventhough I do not have any experience with kids. And I think this is why my bf was so into me, because he could trust me being around his kid. I always wanted my own family one day, but I\u2019ve accepted this at that time. I went on holiday in May 2023, and when I came back we had a conversation about moving into a bigger place, as a reason he told me his son needs more space (we live in a studio flat). I got a little scared and took a step back from this, I didn\u2019t see us moving for his son who is with us every other weekend. My logic was I want to save more money and buy a house instead of rushing to move because his son needs more space. I\u2019ve explained to him my reasonings why I don\u2019t think this is a good idea, we\u2019ve agreed to wait and that was that. I\u2019ve changed my job, and at this new workplace I mainly work with men. He has also changed his job, now he is a truck driver and he is tramping (gone from monday to friday). Since he knew I am working with men, he was very jealous and wanted to know every single detail of my day which I\u2019ve tried to share, however sometimes there is not much to say. As this is an office environment, there were days where I sat down in front of a screen, listened to music and nothing else happened. He was expecting a long conversation but I just didn\u2019t have much to say. And this started a lot of arguments between us, and even when I shared something he found a reason to argue. For example I went to get a coffee with my male colleague, as we were getting more coffees for everyone and I shared this with my partner, of course it was a big argument cause I went for a coffee with a guy from work.. And this was happening daily, a lot of silly arguments, about his son, about my work.. But he still loved me. He would call me few times a day, flirt with me, etc.\n\nFast forward to February 2025, when he told me he doesnt love me anymore. Of course I panicked and cried and begged, told him let\u2019s give us some time, maybe he will realise he misses me and loves me but he was 100% he lost his feelings. The phonecalls stopped, the interest.. I went on holiday end of March 2025, and when I came back he said he wants to try again, but ever since then, he has been acting weird, when we are intimate it\u2019s not passionate, he doesn\u2019t look at me the same, no more flirting.. I would do anything for this guy which is why I have changed my way of thinking and accepted his son again, as I realised this is the LOML and my soulmate. He keeps telling me he loves me but everytime I tell him I am missing something, he just says he doesn\u2019t want drama and makes an argument. I dont know what to do, I love him but he acts like he doesn\u2019t love me. He said the more I expect the less I will get. When I tell him I would like to feel wanted by him calling me once a day, he says \u201cif I don\u2019t have anything to say, I won\u2019t call you. I am trying my best but it that\u2019s not enough, I can\u2019t help you.\u201d Is there a way to make him be obsessed with me again, like before? \n\nI know past is the past, but we\u2019ve both said this was our best relationship. I am willing to make him happy, give him the fairytale we once had. Why is it so hard for him to love me the same?\n\n\nTL;DR, My partner loved me so much before, only saw me, basically was obsessed with me. After period of arguing over his 10 yo son who lives with his ex, and my new job with male colleagues, he told me he doesnt love me. After a month he tells me he loves me again, but it just hasn\u2019t been the same. Is there a way to recover the spark?",

He said he didn't love you anymore (big deal) and you begged to be together. So he is together with you but not in love with you. That spark won't come back, and he is mean to you.

We had and still have loads in common, same music taste, enjoy the same kind of social events and just generally get on really well. The issues started to arise about a year and a half ago. She had been open about struggles with depression in the past from the get go, as was I, but about 7months in her mental state really took a turn. She stopped wanting to go out and started to rely on me for more and more. It came to a point (I\u2019m not sure when exactly) where I found myself more as her live in carer than her boyfriend. I was responsible for cooking, cleaning, and making sure she was happy. While this was going on I really struggled trying to find work in her area which began to take a toll on my confidence. Eventually though I did managed to find myself a job local to her\u2026 until i started to miss shifts because of her mental breakdowns which would make me scared to leave her on her own. This basically culminated in me deciding that we needed a break to figure some things out. Cut to now\u2026 and I have no idea what to do. I know that as things are this isn\u2019t a sustainable relationship, but she knows that too and I do think she\u2019s trying to change. I love her and I keep trying to think of how we can go forward but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just being optimistic or if my being with her is just enabling her depressed lifestyle. Honestly any advice would be appreciated at this point.\n\n**TL;DR;** my girlfriend\u2019s depression has been taking a heavy toll on both her and me.

She needs to see a doctor, a psychiatrist, a therapist, and go to outpatient. Outpatient therapy saved me, and it saved my life. I noticed my mental health  was negatively effecting my relationship, and as hard as it is, she needs to step up and try new methods to help herself. You CANNOT pull her out of this hole, she has to do it. As hard as it is, please don\u2019t skip work, you need to prioritize yourself. She needs a therapist or crisis worker she can call if she has mental breakdowns. As mean as this may sound, I used to have mental breakdowns, and the best thing for me was to learn how to deal with it alone. I still have my days, and I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m positive, but I took matters into my own hands and changed my life even when I was suicidal and bed ridden. She can do it too.

        "text": "I\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9 for years now, and we have a child together. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling deeply unseen and emotionally neglected in our relationship. Physical intimacy has been great, and he\u2019s very loving in that way, but the emotional intimacy, the quiet presence, the affection just to connect (not lead to sex), has been really missing.\n\nMy love language is emotional connection. And when that\u2019s not present, I don\u2019t just feel \u201ca little off.\u201d I feel unimportant and not prioritised. \n\nThere have been a string of moments that built up. He didn\u2019t kiss me goodbye like he usually does. He didn\u2019t pull me in for a hug or cuddle even when we had the chance. When we got home, he took a phone call from a female coworker and took it in the bathroom instead of taking a moment with me, which felt especially disconnecting. These things may sound small, but to me, they felt like big emotional absences.\n\nWhen he came out, I told him that I didn\u2019t feel like a priority anymore. He apologised and said he heard me. He ended up feeling horrible about what he\u2019d done, mentioned that even if I forgive him, he may not be able to forgive himself. Some other things were said and that was the end. Until a couple of days later, he asked if I\u2019d be okay with him going to the gym with that same female coworker. I said no. It hurt that I even had to say it, especially after everything I had just opened up about.\n\nThen not long ago, I asked him, \u201cIs she worth losing me over?\u201d That question completely shattered him. I could see it broke something open in him. He said no, absolutely not, but now I don\u2019t know where we go from here. I feel like I\u2019ve been breaking for a while, and he\u2019s starting to realise it.\n\nFor a bit more context, she\u2019s new to the place. Only been around a few months. He\u2019s been helping her adjust as he\u2019s been there for years. According to him, they just hit it off and get along really well. They talk outside of work a lot. Apparently send memes, jokes and what not to each other. Not that I\u2019ve ever seen any of these conversations. \n\nI\u2019m tired of feeling like I\u2019m begging to be seen. I don\u2019t want to be possessive or controlling. I just want to feel chosen, loved in my own language, and emotionally safe.\n\nHow do we rebuild emotional intimacy when it feels like the cracks have already formed? Has anyone come back from a dynamic like this? Any advice or insight would really help.\n\ntl;dr:\nI love my fianc\u00e9, but I feel emotionally neglected despite good physical intimacy. After multiple moments where I didn\u2019t feel prioritised, I told him I felt disconnected. When he asked about going to the gym with the same female coworker he had originally put before me, I asked if she was worth losing me over, and it shattered him. Now I\u2019m not sure how to move forward or rebuild emotional safety. Looking for advice or experiences.",

Physical love without emotional connection feels hollow when your love language is being seen, heard, and held emotionally. Rebuilding that means consistent, intentional effort from him, not just apologies or guilt. He needs to show you\u2014not just tell you\u2014that you\u2019re his priority, and that includes creating boundaries with people who affect your sense of security. If he truly wants to heal this, he has to actively meet you where you are. Couples can come back from this, but only if both people are willing to do the real work, not just feel bad.",

She Said to me \"We both told each other that we could only be friends.\" when I asked her about their friendship. \n\nI mean yes I may be insecure or not reading g the situation correctly but I have never told a female friend of which I do have a few that \"we can only be friends\" \n\nThey chat daily morning and evenings. \n\nI feel that it is totally unnecessary to say that sentence unless there was movement or signs of things moving in that direction. I have never had to utter those words and have always respected the boundaries of friendship. It keeps replaying in my head and it concerns me that there was a need to say \"we can only be friends\" \n\nI haven't raised the issue but her \"friend\" also wrote some romantic songs for her. She is a singer and writes poems. He is also in the music industry composes music. The \"friendship\" started when he set her words to music. But I found out he wrote multiple songs for or about her. (16 songs) \n\nI am uncomfortable with this \"friendship\" because of a simple sentence that we clearly told one another we can only be friends.\n\nMy gut is telling me something is off.\n\nTL;DR My singer gf has a composer songwriter friend.

        "text": "I would like some relationship advice as I am having trouble navigating my own feelings and have a history of very bad/borderline abusive and definitely toxic relationships. Did a lot of therapy and came out the other side  in a much better spot\n\nFirst things first - gf never been in relationship before (only situationships). I have been in several long term relationships. and recently a short term healthy relationship\n\nIn the beginning I fell in love with girlfriend very hard - we got along very well and I genuinely fell in love with her. Had not connected with someone like her in at least 3 years.\n\nIt took her about a month or two months or so to say I love you after I did. (I said after 3 months she said after maybe 5).\n\nWe both live alone. I knew that I wanted to start a family sometime soonish (5 years out maybe or sooner) and start to settle down and asked about moving in together.\n\nShe said 1 year she would consider.\n\nAsked her again about it after 9 months because I was trying to figure out logistics and again she said she wasn\u2019t ready.\n\nI ended up moving from down the street to a little bit farther away (but we still see each other often and doesn\u2019t really hinder time together).\n\nI did this because I was in a bad commute situation and didn\u2019t want to wait around for her to wanna move in with me. She especially didnt like the idea of moving to suburbs away from city.\n\nAnyways - right around her 30th she started to get distant. She doesn\u2019t really express emotions all the time and its very hard for me to tell if she is upset or happy or sad.\n\nLong story short I brought up moving in again just kind of talking about how it would be nice to split rent and how I would pay way more since I make more. I never discussed this in the past but I wanted to add that bc I am thinking of the future. This was what I thought was a casual conversation and I was just dreaming if a future together.\n\nI guess this triggered her. We got in a fight after trying to communicate and she said that maybe if she cant commit to what I want that maybe we shouldn\u2019t be together. She added a lot of things like saying she hates her self for sending this and she wished everything would be okay.\n\nShe was also triggered by her birthday and had just got a new job but she still doesn\u2019t know what she wants in the future and has no goals etc.\n\nI am not going to lie - when I saw that message it truly broke my heart and I cried and hugged myself and rocked back and forth like a little baby lol.\n\nI texted her and told her I was sorry for pushing too hard. I went over and everything was \u201cfine\u201d.\n\nAnyways - after a few months I brought up our fight because I feel like nothing was ever resolved (here is another common thread - she doesn\u2019t communicate her needs and I am the only one to bring up communication or relationship issues).\n\nShe agreed to go to therapy and has started to figure out her avoidant tendencies and commitment issues.\n\nShe says she loves me and I am everything she ever wanted.\n\nNow the problem is that I have become more anxious ever since she sent that text. I feel like I am just in a waiting pattern now for her to figure out what she wants.\n\nShe has started saying \u201cI love you\u201d more since I asked for that and she barely said it before. And their are other changes she has made.\n\nI dont know if this is normal? I just want to progress the relationship yet it feels like it is stagnating. I am having a hard time discerning if I am pushing too hard because I am anxious or if I am pushing because I just want to build a life together. I know what I want. I wanna marry her and everything.\n\nNow I am starting to feel small bits of resentment. I guess I want to be the one to pull away. She is supposed to come over after work today bc we are bother traveling this weekend - since our last conversation I feel like I am not happy in this relationship.\n\nI feel like the waiting is really getting to me - its only been about 2 months or so since that fight as well.\n\nTL;DR: \n\nGirlfriend mentioned breaking up after I oushed her on moving in after a year and now I cant get over this anxious feeling and feeling bad and feeling stuck. \n\nHow do I know when to call it quits and when to wait around ???",

If this is her first serious relationship at age 30, then she has never lived with a partner before, and doing that for the first time feels like a lot bigger of a deal than doing it for the second or third time. Plus, she may be slightly commitment-averse on top of that if she never had a serious relationship. \n\nI also think her never communicating her needs is borne out of her lack of relationship experience. I think you might just find it a lot more enjoyable to be with somebody who has already been through a few serious relationships and is more ready for the type of commitment you're looking for. That being said, it sounds like she is genuinely making an effort, going to therapy, and expressing herself a bit more. I might wait and see how things develop over the next 6 months or so.",

        "post-author": "casualblaseballer",
        "text": "When I was in college 10 years ago, I became really tight with my roommate, Marybeth. Sometimes we\u2019d hang out with her best friend, Seth; Seth\u2019s girlfriend, Juniper; and Juniper\u2019s friend, Annie, who had already\u00a0 graduated but came to visit a lot.\n\nFast forward a decade, and all of us had moved to a big city nearby. I was in grad school, so I was pretty busy, but I made time to hang out with Marybeth as often as I could. I would see the rest when my schedule allowed. Marybeth and I sometimes talked about how Annie made us uncomfortable, because she trauma-dumped constantly. Annie especially liked to trauma-dump with me because both of us dealt with stalkers. I understood her pain, but I didn\u2019t want to talk about what had happened to me all the time.\n\nThings started to get more intense when Annie decided she wanted to be in the same field as me. Throughout adulthood, Annie has had jobs for a few months here and there, but it ends with her getting fired. She\u2019s trained as a teacher and is good at it, she just loses steam or doesn\u2019t show up. Neither of us had jobs during the beginning of the pandemic, so we put together a virtual camp for tweens who wanted to write. It ended up going okay, though I had to project-manage Annie a lot. Then I got a job offer and didn\u2019t have time anymore. My career field is a blend of tech and creative writing and requires a lot of niche skills. Annie decided she also wanted to join this field when our camp finished, and I encouraged her, but also told her that it would take a lot of work/time/training for her to build up a portfolio. She did do a few spec projects, but none of them went anywhere.\n\nA few years ago, I joined a project that required me to move across the country, which suited me because I couldn\u2019t afford the city any longer (it\u2019s one of the most expensive in the world). Every few months, Annie would text me about jobs, asking if I knew anyone at this or that company. I would usually tell her \u201cno,\u201d even if I did. One of our mutual friends recommended her for a job at his company, and she again lasted a few months before she was placed on a PIP and then fired. I didn\u2019t want to be responsible for the same fiasco. After awhile, Annie\u2019s requests started to really wear on me, and I mostly stopped responding to her.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Annie does not need to work because her husband, Matteo, is rich. They live in a high-rise in one of the most expensive neighborhoods of my former city and recently took a weeks-long trip to one of the costliest countries in the world. It\u2019s always been grating to hear Annie complain about not having a job and being broke because she doesn't have to worry about where she'll live. For her, working is a choice, not a necessity. I get that she feels bad with no creative outlet, but she is \\*not\\* broke.\n\nLast weekend was Marybeth\u2019s wedding, so I went back to the city with my partner. We were seated with Marybeth\u2019s best friend, Seth, and Annie. It\u2019s been a rough year for both Seth and Annie. Seth and his college girlfriend Juniper had gotten married, but then they divorced after Juniper cheated. Seth got every single friend in the divorce, even Annie (Juniper's best friend), which is probably some kind of record. Seth has been struggling, and Annie has stepped up to help, though, from what Marybeth's said, it's mostly Annie and Seth mutually trauma-dumping about Juniper. Marybeth asked if it would be chill to seat me with them, since they didn\u2019t know many other people, and I said sure.\n\nIt was not super chill. Annie kept trying to talk to me about how down she was over losing Juniper and not having a job. She didn\u2019t ask me for help getting work this time, but she did talk about how ugly and fat she is, which didn\u2019t make me feel great because we have a similar body type. (Also, Annie is conventionally attractive.) As Annie got drunker, she asked if I was mad at her and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t answer her messages. She kept repeating that I was a really special friend and she wanted to keep me in her life. We literally hadn\u2019t seen each other for years :/ \u00a0I kept telling her that we could talk about it after the wedding.\n\nI told her I'd call on Saturday. Tbh, I don\u2019t know if I even should call. I\u2019m thinking I should maybe send her a long text explaining that we have different perspectives on this friendship, and that I wish her the best and I\u2019m so, so glad she has been supportive of Seth, but I feel like she spent years seeing me as a career pathway. Do you think this is the right approach?\n\nTL;DR: college acquaintance says our friendship is really special to her, but I feel like she just wants me for my career connections and I can\u2019t keep doing this.",

                "body": "Do you think you will continue to run into Annie socially, with regularity, or is this wedding about it? \n\nHere's the thing about breaking up with friends. If a friend no longer wants to be friends with me, I'd personally like to know why so I can put it behind me. So when possible I do tell people why I am going to end a friendship with them, in the kindest way possible. \n\nBut a long text with the reasons isn't going to be seen by Annie as welcome closure for a friendship. It's going to be things she can argue or disagree with. She doesn't have the social awareness or the emotional intelligence to get feedback. She's lost every job she's gotten. She's probably heard about the same issues every time, but it doesn't change her behavior. She's not capable of hearing feedback and integrating it in a way to change herself. She's lost friends too. Yet she continues to engage in very socially inappropriate behavior, like trauma dumping and using connections to get jobs and then burning that connection. \n\nIf you stop being her friend, she is going to spend zero amount of time honestly reflecting on what she may have done to contribute to it. She is going to move on to the next person, the next crisis, the next person to inflict herself on. She can easily life the rest of her life like that. Many people do. Her financially protected circumstances make it even easier for her not to experience consequences of her actions. \n\nIf you send her a long text about why you can't be her friend, it will just be the next crisis. She will forward it to all your friends. She will trauma dump about you. She will cry about how she losses friends. She will hear nothing of the content in it. \n\nSo you should instead do one of two things. If you aren't going to see her much in life moving forward, just let her know you're too busy for a call, and move on with life. No need to declare the friendship over, if you're not expected to see and interact with her regularly. \n\nBut if you are going to be seeing and interacting with her regularly, don't send her a long text about the friendship. Tell her that you feel like your friendship revolves around her and her crisis, and you're going to take a step back from it because you've realized it's been really draining for you. If you do have to see and interact with her in the future, being polite but distant will track with saying that you are trying to avoid drama. \n\nBut it sounds like you will probably not regularly see her. So I would just take a step back mentally, stop responding quickly or at all to texts, let her know you are not available for calls, and she will probably find another mark.",

I go back to NYC (no need to be coy about the city I guess) once or twice a year, as finances allow, to see Marybeth/all my grad school friends. Annie is never there, though Seth sometimes is. Marybeth also doesn't like interacting with her in small groups; she puts up with Annie for Seth's sake.\n\nI was just chatting with my partner and learned that the reason why she suddenly grabbed me and insisted on tequila shots during the reception was that Annie was telling her way too much personal information.

So I may end up sitting down with Marybeth and Seth once the wedding excitement has died down and telling them that I'm not going to formally end the friendship with Annie for all the good reasons you cited, but I'm putting a hard no on seeing her during group hangs when I visit.",

        "text": "I (23f) and my (25m) boyfriend have been in a relationship for about 8 months now. We truly thought we were twin flames. A deep connection that\u2019s undeniable.\n\nHowever, we both have mental health issues. I have been doing better, but he has been falling off the rails a bit with increasingly stressful loads put on him.\n\nHe has an extremely avoidant attachment style and I have an extremely anxious attachment style but I have completely dropped it to tend to him.\n\nHe has avoidant \u201cdiscarded\u201d me about 3-4 times before where out of nowhere, he claims we have been fighting a lot (we used to, but I swore to do better and I have) and he doesn\u2019t want me anymore. 24 hours will pass and he will regret it.\n\nHe said recently he has never felt anything this real and it scares him to get too close. He pushes people away and isolates himself.\n\nI have tried to stay strong, even with my abandonment wound ripped wide open each time he gets down.\n\nI have catered to him emotionally and even physically, making sure he eats. Every day, he sits on the couch on the phone or staring at a wall.\n\nHe is expressing some suicidal thoughts but tells me if I say anything to anyone, he will never speak to me again. He claims I am making his mental health worse when I asked if I was.\n\nHe claims he doesn\u2019t care about anything anymore. I have spent countless hours giving him space, being a listening ear, a shoulder to cry on, etc.\n\nI\u2019m starting to become exhausted and miserable myself. Being told he doesn\u2019t want me, him getting snappy when I pry about his feelings, being the keeper of his dark thoughts..\n\nThe life and joy has been sucked completely out of him and our relationship. He stopped planning dates, bringing me flowers. He used to be so goofy and silly and now he\u2019s completely vacant.\n\nHe has struggled with mental health for a very long time. I am trying so hard to be there for him but his answer to almost everything is \u201ci don\u2019t care.\u201d \u201cso what?\u201d \u201ci don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nI offered to pay for his therapy and medicine. He refuses any professional or personal help.\n\nI\u2019m scared he will try something stupid.\n\nI have spent entire days giving him space but at some point I feel obligated to try and talk. \n\nDo I just give him space? Do I leave? I\u2019m so lost, i\u2019m trying so hard to be a strong willed and supportive girlfriend. I\u2019m trying to be his rock but I\u2019m thinking I should just let him be.\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would be amazing.\n\nTL;DR! my boyfriend\u2019s depression is having an effect on us and me.

Sometimes it does, but that's usually if we're showing stuff to each other or playing a game so we have something to talk about, but even then conversations pretty much always stay on the things themselves. \n\nSometimes in conversations with others we get to other topics, and she does speak on those, and I end up learning things about her that I haven't in our 10 months of dating (and about a year before that of friendship)\n\nA few times we have done those \"50 questions to ask your girlfriend/boyfriend/whatever\" things and that does at least give us a way to talk about a variety of things, but it rarely sparks a deeper conversation that goes beyond the prompt.\n\nWhen we first started dating, I figured it would get better over time, that we would learn to communicate or have more opportunities to talk as we went on, and I eventually forgot that it was a concern. However recently she herself brought it up as an issue, and since then I can't stop worrying about it.\n\nI have a weird thing in relationships, where issues like this make me really anxious and upset. I worry that they are insurmountable and spell the end of the relationship, which I know is an overreaction, but that's how anxiety is.\n\nShe has said it could be her, that she has a tendency to be a dry texter and is bad at conversations, but I don't really think that's the case, since she talks more with other people and has a lot of friends. I do think it could be the combination of both of us being bad at conversation though. It's just frustrating :/\n\nTLDR  \nme and my girlfriend have a hard time having conversations that stray from simple \"how are you\"s",

Is this awkwardness primarily when texting, or is it just as difficult in person?\n\nMy partner is one of my best friends, and we always have some nonsense to talk about. It's usually not deep conversations, but we talk about all kinds of things. Shows or books, random crap we saw online, anything can spark some conversation. Because we like being around each other, we're comfortable with each other, and we \\*want\\* to share our thoughts. And both of us are pretty awkward socially around people we don't know well.

Since it's something you both want to work on, you could read a book or watch videos on how to learn to carry a conversation. \n\nOne thing to start with is remembering to ask open-ended questions, not yes or no. And more specific questions rather than vague. Like, I hate when someone asks me \"tell me about yourself\" because that's so broad, but a more specific targeted question can be helpful.\n\nAnd you can also pay attention to how your conversations flow when you're talking to other people. What are they asking? Are they sharing way more than you? What kind of things do they say that prompt you to share more? etc.",

If you can't handle her talking about boyfriends and future relationships then you can't handle being friends.  \n\nNo matter what happens telling her your feelings is always a risk and will always change things.

I\u2019m scared because I don\u2019t think I can\n\nI 26/F have been with my 27/boyfriend for over 7 years now. And we\u2019ve been starting to talk about leveling up our relationship to the next level. He\u2019s a good man and I do love him but I\u2019m really scared about the future.\n\nFor context, he has a 20yo sibling who has severe autism. He has a brain of a 2-year old. Cannot communicate (but somewhat understands a few words based on his reactions), and does vocal stimming. Right now he\u2019s under the care of both of his parents.\n\nMy bf told me that when the time comes that his parents can no longer take care of his brother, he plans to take him in with us. And that just scared me. I\u2019m a light sleeper, so if he does vocal stimming at night (at worst, every night) idk if i\u2019m ever going to get enough sleep. He seems kinda violent sometimes (at one point, he pulled my hair really hard at their family gathering for no reason). And I also want to have a dog in the future but I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s going to be okay with it? (Right now they have dogs but they don\u2019t let them inside the house). And what about if we have kids\u2026 how are they going to react. To add, he also poops everywhere and literally needs to be monitored 24/7 because he does a lot of things like drinking water from the toilet, or eating things he shouldn\u2019t. As a person who loves to travel, I feel like when he starts living with us, we won\u2019t be able to travel as a complete family as he would have to stay with him.\n\n\nThere\u2019s all sorts of questions in my head and anxious thoughts that weigh so much. I don\u2019t want to breakup and sometimes I blame myself for not thinking through this from the very beginning. But I don\u2019t regret every single moment with my bf. I love him so much and I was ready to be his bride\u2026 not until this thought came into the picture.\n\n\n",

We aren't talking about some physically vulnerable guy who just needs someone around if he falls over or someone to do a daily check. It sounds like responsible care would be full time supervision. Is that going to be your BF who then won't be able to work? Is it expected to be you? Is there actually some other expectation you haven't even assessed with discussion?\n\n\nWho cares about vacation travels, you haven't worked out anything about daily life.\n\n\nKids will be both a split of costs and a split of attention. Asking any one person to supervise a newborn or baby or toddler and a grown man with his level of support needs is pretty unsafe. I'm not saying he necessarily can't be around babies at all but that someone over 130 lbs drinking out of toilets and a new baby is too much for one sleep deprived person to monitor and give full appropriate care simultaneously. But presumably at least one of you works?\n\n\nAnd people will be like this guy needs to be in care but that's not a quick or free process even if you all agree and the care is available and good.\n\n\nWhen are you going to have this discussion?\u00a0\n\n\nLike loving him is great but burning better half of a decade without really talking about if you can live together or what the future looks like wouldn't be acceptable to me, personally.

One would watch his brother during the day and the other at night? How would the pair of you support your household?

Does he know if his brother is in any sort of therapies (occupational/physical/behavioral/cognitive)? Does he know if his parents send his brother to adult daycare for people with special needs?\n\nYour boyfriend said one sentence about his brother moving in but didn\u2019t actually discuss any of the real world implications of that sentence. He cannot assume that his brother could or even should live with him. Has he actually discussed his brother\u2019s future with his parents? Would his brother living with him, and by extension you, be what\u2019s best for his brother? Like we\u2019re all wondering if it is even an ok suggestion for you and your boyfriend but has anyone actually thought if maybe it isn\u2019t the best thing for his brother?\n\nYou need to decide for yourself what you want your future to look like. No one can decide that for you, including your boyfriend. Then you need to be honest with your boyfriend about what you want for your future and if need be break up. \n\nHe also needs to have a serious discussion with his parents about what will happen when they are gone. Have they set any plans in motion that he doesn\u2019t know about? He should spend time finding out the extent of his brother\u2019s care and what going on daily now to know what will be expected later.",

It's not your job to forfeit your future safety and happiness so your brother can take care of his adult brother later.  It's lovely that he wants to do this for his family member; your BF must be a compassionate and caring human.  BUT, you have to consider your whole life. You want dogs, you want kids, you want travel.  None of that is congruent with the life your boyfriend is presenting to you when the brother is under your care as a couple.  \n\nIt's time to have a chat with your boyfriend and be very honest that you don't think the life you want with travel, kids and dogs is possible if his brother lives with you.  Many high-needs adults live in group homes or facilities where they have care-givers on staff 24/7, and family is there to visit all the time.  It's a better place for them often because the trained staff and medical professionals can cater to their needs in a way that family can't.  Find out if he's open to the idea of that rather than actually caring for him himself (although he does need to think ahead to, what does he imagine the brother would do while you were both at work, for example?)   Because if he's steadfast that he'll take his brother in no matter what, you're better to cut ties now.",

How does your boyfriend intend to provide the level of attention his brother needs & deserves? \n\nWhile I think it\u2019s totally fair if this is a deal breaker for you - and it\u2019s something to be discussed sooner than later so that you can make a decision now vs. investing more time in a relationship that ultimately can\u2019t work in the long run - I\u2019d make sure your boyfriend fully understands what would be entailed and is making an informed, realistic decision, before breaking up over it. \n\nIt may end up that his brother is better off in some sort of group home setting. Instead of planning on caring for his brother himself, maybe you guys could look into options together and figure out a good transition plan so that it\u2019s not like your boyfriend feels like he\u2019s just dumping his brother into a strange place. (Colin Farrell recently put his son in a group living home, even though he can still care for him at home & has the financial resources, since he knows he won\u2019t be around forever and wants his son to be established in a supportive environment while he can still be there for him and spend time together)\n\n*ETA: I would encourage your boyfriend to speak with his parents openly and honestly, as well as seek input from his brother\u2019s healthcare providers and/or a social worker to come up with a plan now - this is something that has a legal/estate planning aspect to it that his parents should have already addressed and need to do now if they haven\u2019t already. Take out as much of the hypothetical as possible.*\n\n*Even if he doesn\u2019t live with you, your boyfriend\u2019s brother is still going to impact your life.

I\u2019m not sure the proper way to put this but I\u2019ve heard that their culture (Mexican) is not receptive to treatment for ASD disorders, I just tried to google it and the best way someone put it is that they have a stigma towards those types of things. Im not experienced with kids, but I suspect the child is autistic only by comparing him to other kids of his age and noticing that his communication is very poor in terms of, it\u2019s hard to understand the words he is saying, and also what his sentences mean. \n\nFor example one time at dinner he randomly told me \u201cthe dog is bleeding\u201d and before I could try and figure that out, his mother told me he\u2019s talking about when their dog had puppies and there was blood everywhere from the birth. He also seems to have trouble with concepts of time, will ask the same question over and over. Since I\u2019m not experienced with kids, I\u2019m not sure how, developed they\u2019re supposed to be at 7. \n\nWhen my mom met the little brother for a family holiday, she said she agrees with me that she thinks he\u2019s autistic and wanted to talk to the mom about getting him support at school, but we were both unsure how to bring it up without causing offense.\n\nWhen discussing the topic of having kids with my partner, I tried to gauge him by asking if he had any autism in his family at all, because I believe I\u2019m autistic, and he confidently said no. So either he\u2019s in denial or he is truly unaware, or I am judging the kid too hard?\n\nAccepting any advice you may have on this delicate subject!!!!",

The caretaker has changed multiple times because it is a tough job! But not everybody has the means to hire a caretaker, or send them to a place specialised for such people. \n\nThe conversation of what's going to happen to her when the parents are gone is one they hate having. Her parents feel bad but also resent her and hate that their situation is like this. They mostly pretend she doesn't exist. She's in her own room most of the time. Even during meal times, they bring the food into her room, she doesn't eat at the dining table with them. \n\nMy friend and her other sister (who's obese so she will be partially disabled on her own if she gets worse) both know neither of them wants to look after her when the parents are gone. But.. Of course they don't tell their parents that.\n\nIf your bf is 1000% set on his brother staying in the same house, you need to have this conversation ASAP. Is your bf going to hire someone to look after him? Or is he going to do it himself, or is he expecting you to be his caretaker?

He should understand that his brother's condition might worsen; he himself might develop a health condition or become burned out; or he might come to prioritize other aspects of his life at some point. Deeming the topic of outsourcing care \"non-negotiable\" from the start shows obstinance, immaturity, and a lack of understanding of the kind of care his brother will demand along with his own capabilities and limitations. \n\nHe's going to find out real fast how well his plan plays out, and I wouldn't want to be around when it happens.",

He needs to have a clear and detailed plan in place in the absence of paid professional help. I would walk away if he can't provide that or his plan requires more of you than you can give. End things if it becomes clear this would be too much to handle.

We have been prepping for this for years: she has a trust for her money, a separate person in charge of her medical decisions, my husband and I do not have children in case she must live with us, and her team of doctors and specialists know to include me in her medical, dental, and vision care appointments.

He probably doesn't really realize what that looks like - and like others have suggested, he should probably take over care for a few days/weeks to see what that might actually look like if he does decide to go that route. \n\nSomething I haven't seen is that long term, taking over the care financially will be something he DOES need to start planning for now, and can start building up a safety net for, regardless of what happens between the two of you. Whether it's in-home care done by him or care from a nurse or in a facility set up for that, it's expensive. \n\nGood luck - the hardest conversations are usually the ones that are the most worth it/important.",

I\u2019ve know great situations and not so great situations. Some families choose to keep a person with disabilities home because they love them and want to protect them - and some do better with activities and socialization. This is a very complex problem. You\u2019d also need to know what the finances are. Is there money for care takers ? Would you be able to have help ?  This isn\u2019t a black and white situation.",

Honestly, he may be better served transitioning to adult care facility, where he can have consistency of care while your parents are still alive. That way your parents are not struggling to care for him as they age, and he is not transitioning to a new living situation while having lost parents. \n\nHowever, many parents still remember a time when a full time facility for someone who can't care for themselves were not good environments, and think that only family can and should care for a family member. However you might ask if the family has ever looked into those options. \n\nOtherwise, you should break up. It's totally fine that you don't want to live with and care for his brother long term.

        "text": "Me (30M) and a friend (28F) have been seeing each other the past several months. We have done lots of date-y things \u2014 taken each other out for dinner, held hands, kissed a handful of times, etc. However, we haven\u2019t had a \u201cdefine the relationship (DTR)\u201d talk until the other day. \n\nThey said they aren\u2019t ready to commit to a romantic relationship, but ensured that there are romantic feelings and that they love spending time with me. I have no reason to believe they\u2019re just using me or coming up with a random excuse not to commit. I can give some more details, but the things they said during this DTR have aligned with what i know about their last relationship(s) and why they ended/what they\u2019ve discovered about themselves through them. \n\nI am crazy about them, and they have definitely reciprocated my feelings. I feel understood and they make me feel special. I can honestly say that they are a rare type of connection i have only had with another couple of people in my life. \n\nSo my question is this: is the \u201cnot ready to commit right now\u201d a true excuse in your experience? Are there friends (who eventually turned into couples) out there who simply waited for one person to be ready before actually committing to being in a relationship? Or is this most always a sign that things will not go any further? Do I at least somewhat pull back from our relationship to guard my heart?\n\ntl;dr person i have been seeing hit me with the \u201cI am not ready to commit to a romantic relationship card.\u201d I was told there are romantic feelings and that they love our relationship, they just aren\u2019t in a place to give all of themselves to dating me. Is there hope for us to eventually date or should I protect my heart and take a step back?",

If you continue to spend time with them and engage romantically, who\u2019s to say your feelings won\u2019t deepen further and make it hurt more (both the ongoing situation  and it potentially ending)? This seems to me like they\u2019re keeping you on the line for potential future relationship. Maybe they need more time to make up their mind?

        "text": "My partner and I met and started dating 6 years ago. When we first met they didnt identify as non-binary, and we started our relationship as a lesbian relationship. I am a lesbian and I am not attracted to men. I have tried, many times, it just does not happen for me and I cannot force it. That being said they were the love of my life. We fell very very in love and I have never experienced the acceptance they showed me. The love they showed me was magic and I look back with very strong fondness at that time of my life.\n\nThey started to transition in earnest 3 years ago. They were very hesitant to do so initially. They knew I'm a lesbian and was not attracted to men. And they didnt want to transition for that reason. I encouraged them to do it wholeheartedly, because being trans is something you do for yourself, not for anyone else. I assured them that I wasn't considering leaving them over that,  and that it was men i wasnt attracted to not non-binary people. I told them that they had to do it for themselves. That it was crucial, even. And they did, they've been on T for quite a while and are much more masculine and in general pass as a man. They're non-binary, but yeah even so we get read as a straight couple and theyre often referred to as my boyfriend (a term they like). Over time though... its just not the same anymore. I struggle with intimacy with them, I am still deeply attracted to who they are. But their body has changed and their demeanor has changed and it's just no longer within what I'm attracted to. Its starting to hurt me to force myself through it. I want them to be happy but I am unsatisfied in several ways and have had a lot of feelings that I'm not voicing because I do not want to hurt them in any way.\n\nThey are also disabled and reliant on me for a lot of things. I rely on them for a lot too, as I am not always in the best mental state. Neither of us has a relationship with our families. We both experienced a lot of abuse growing up so we're mostly by ourselves. I can work and am working but they aren't as they have been going to therapy. They wouldn't have anywhere to go if our relationship ended. They don't have support to fall back on. And their mental health fluctuates and at somewhat routine times they are suicidal. I'm so scared of what would happen if I did decide to leave.\n\nI don't really know what I'm looking for. Someone who has been in this situation I guess? I feel so much guilt and fear. I'm semi-sick today because of how anxious this whole thing is making me. I'm so scared of being alone too. They do provide emotional support to me, which has been very helpful for me at times. I just don't know what to do. I feel like no matter how I look at the situation I'm in the wrong. That I'd be throwing away the life weve built together and that its my fault.\n\nTL;DR my partner transitioned and I'm losing attraction to them but they are disabled and we are very dependent and I have no idea what to do.",

                "body": "First things first, it's obvious from your post that you love your partner deeply. \n\nLosing attraction to someone can happen over a relationship. It does happen quite often. Sometimes there are ways to gain back that attraction, but in your case it doesn't seem possible. You are a lesbian. Your partner's body has become too masculine for you to be attracted to that body. \n\nIt's not your fault and it doesn't in any way make you a bad person, and it doesn't mean you don't love your partner enough.\n\nBut since you love them, I think you know deep down they deserve to be with someone who desires them. And you deserve to be with someone you're attracted to. Having to force yourself to be intimate is awful, and I'm pretty sure your partner would never want you to go through that, even moreso with them.\n\nI am disabled myself. No family either. What I get from the state isn't enough to live. And if I were in your partner's situation, everything I said above still holds. \n\nYou are not being kind by staying with them out of fear of what will happen to them. It's too close to pity, and I'd never want the person I love to pity me.\n\nDo you think if you break up you could still live together until their situation improves ? Is that something you'd be willing to do ? (I beg of you, answer that question honestly, and if you feel like you'd have to force a yes, say no. Be kind to yourself.)",

But it would be best for both of us for him to find someone who wanted the new her and me to find someone who was the gender I was attracted to.\n\nI got no problem with people transitioning or whatever, to me it's whatever, it's their bodies and person. Our first date we had a very obviously not passing but transitioning male to female. After we said what we wanted for drinks and left we both looked at each and had a whole conversation with looks cause ya it was very obvious the 6' waitress with an adam's apple the size of a golf ball and deep voice, probably wasn't bio female even if she was dressed all cute in female clothes.\n\nIt actually helped us to know we both just rolled with it and treated her like anyone else I think, sorta like be aware of how your new partner treats others sort of thing. And kudos to that waitress for doing such a public job while transitioning, and I gotta say she was damn good at the job!\n\nBut partner transitioning is totally different. It's like if you're a cat person, and while you like other people's dogs ok, your cat turned into a dog... you'd probably be all wtf off center mentally.",

You just aren't compatible and that's not something you can force. \n\nBreaking up doesn't have to mean they're living on the streets. You can always continue to live together and support each other as friends while you figure out where one or both of you goes to live eventually. It's definitely a tough situation, but at the end of the day you're just not compatible as romantic partners and continuing to live that lie is going to be as harmful as your partner living in the wrong body was.",

                "body": "So not the exact situation, but one of my ex's was a trans woman who had just started transitioning when we met. I am AFAB and non-binary/gender queer. We had a close relationship and we're committed to one another but she eventually started feeling like she wanted to be with a man. I tried to step up in a lot of ways to create more of the dynamic she was looking for, but it didn't make up for the fact that I wasn't a man. She ended up breaking it off with me which I was heartbroken about. My mental health wasn't the best at the time as well. It was the first time I'd lost a relationship that was positive, which is a different kind of loss than a relationship that ended because things weren't going well. It was tough but I got through it.\n\nIt sounds like you're running up against an incompatibility with your current partner, and it might be one that you can't move past. It's okay to go find something that works better for you, even if there's something good where you are. You don't hear about that kind of situation very often so I think we sometimes feel that it's selfish. As much as it hurt at the time, I'm glad my ex broke it off with me when the relationship stopped working for her. It set me free to find someone that could more fully choose me. \n\nThe last thing I'll leave you with is a piece of advice I got when I broke it off with a partner that was often suicidal and even tried to commit suicide when I broke up with them. Ultimately we need to have boundaries where we leave the responsibility of keeping one's self alive to the individual people themselves. Or in other words, it's all our own responsibility to keep ourselves alive. We can be caring people that do things like call 911 or bring someone to the emergency room, but if someone ends their life, it's their final responsibility, not ours. Otherwise, we can drive ourselves crazy trying to stop people from hurting themselves and that isn't fair. Staying in a relationship with someone because they might hurt themselves is self-betrayal, not something compassionate.\n\nGood luck out there! You got this \u2665\ufe0f",

You are a lesbian and are attracted to women, that's okay, there is nothing wrong with that. \n\nMy advice, write down the main points you want them to hear from you and then have that hard conversation. My spouse had to do the same, it was uncomfortable and scary but we got through it. \n\nIf you don't work out as a couple, doesn't mean you can't remain in each others lives if that's what you both want. \n\nDon't let resentment build up.

        "post-author": "AdmirableMushroom755",
        "text": "Hi everyone - I am a 28F and have been dating my 27M boyfriend for a little over 2.5 years now. We moved in together about 10 months and things have been going great. Apart from the usual couple ups and downs, we have a healthy relationship and share a pet together.\n\nWhen we first started dating, we very loosely talked about timelines - I told him I wanted to get engaged around year 3 and married by 4 years together. That seemed like a reasonable plan to him at the time as well. Fast forward to now, I brought up a conversation about potentially getting engaged in the fall at our 3 years, and long story short, he feels reluctant. He has some vague feelings about not being ready, wanting to wait till year 4 to get engaged, etc. We got into an argument about it and I ascertained that he has a lot of anxiety about the future and struggles to look ahead and feel excited about the future. I am a huge planner and look forward to milestones in my life, whereas he takes life more \u201cday-by-day\u201d.  There is a chance we might be long distance next year because of our careers, and he mentioned that this gives him sadness and anxiety and he\u2019s just in general not looking towards things changing.\n\nI\u2019ve told him multiple times that I\u2019m not interested in being someone\u2019s long term girlfriend, I want more, I\u2019m excited about being married to him and starting a life together. I also told him that I am not planning on waiting around forever and will end the relationship at some point if marriage isn\u2019t in the picture. After talking a lot, we\u2019ve agreed to be engaged by the end of 2025. Last time we spoke, he said \u201cI\u2019m coming around more to the idea of that\u201d which made me feel bad. Originally I was glad to at least have some reassurance that it was going to happen this year, but now I\u2019m feeling resentful and frustrated and like I pressured him. He\u2019s not brought up engagement ring shopping at all on his own and continues to never bring up the subject. I realized that while I was initially happy that we discussed getting engaged this year, I am starting to get scared that he still might not be ready and I may get some version of a \u201cshut-up ring\u201d on December 31st. I know he loves me and wants to be with me, I trust that he is true about his feelings, but I don\u2019t trust that he is capable of taking the next step. I am scared I am pressuring him into this and that I would feel unsatisfied even if it did happen because it wasnt his own autonomous decision.\n\nI\u2019m starting to feel resentful even in our happy moments together. Whenever we are relaxing or cuddling and he\u2019s telling me how much he\u2019ll miss me when I travel for work, I can\u2019t help but think \u201cyou love me and our life but you don\u2019t want to get married.\u201d And it makes me resent him. I\u2019ve been trying to start couples therapy to talk about this but haven\u2019t found an available appointment yet. I really don\u2019t know how to cope with these feelings and I would appreciate any insight or experiences that might be similar.\n\nTLDR: My (28F) boyfriend (27M) of 2.5 years \u201cnot ready\u201d/ \u201ccoming around to\u201d the idea of engagement this year but I am feeling resentful that he hasn\u2019t taken any steps towards doing so and anxious that I have pressured him and don\u2019t know how to cope",

It doesn't sound like the delay is related to his lack of feelings/commitment for/to you since he keeps emphasizing how much he's going to miss you when you guys are apart. Maybe he wants to get engaged at a time when he feels like he can be around to enjoy you more, or something. I'm not sure what else makes him feel not ready. What specifically does he feel like he needs in order to feel more ready? And how can he plan for that so he can ensure that if you guys don't get engaged this year, he'll feel stable by the next year?\n\nOn your end, you don't want to feel like he's only submitting to what you want which is understandable. You don't want to feel like you had to pull teeth to get him to agree to your plan. Perhaps you could stand to meet him halfway on this since as you said, when you first discussed this, being engaged by year three was only a \"loose\" plan, and not something set in stone. It can be hard to foresee what things will come up that far in advance. Things usually don't go exactly as planned in life, and that's not necessarily a sign that it's never going to happen. It's just that life has a way of throwing unexpected curveballs at us, so sometimes we need to manage our expectations around how we thought things were going to go.",

I guess something me and him will have to talk about more is why he\u2019s waiting, what his attitude to marriage is, what will make him feel ready and want to propose of his own volition. \n\nI\u2019m realizing from this thread that I need to better manage my expectations and not feel as resentful that things aren\u2019t going according to my specifically laid out 4 year plan.

It's not necessarily the specific change in question that is the trigger. Which is why it can be triggered even over positive changes. How does he generally respond once a change (let's say a good one) has happened? Does he mostly just experience anxiety in the anticipation of change and then once it finally happens, he adjusts okay or even likes it? Or does he feel pretty anxious both before and after?\n\nYes, it's definitely worth talking about with him to prevent misunderstandings/assumptions and resentment from forming. Sometimes in our insecurity we wind up projecting and hurting our own feelings. He probably just needs to know that you're there to listen and understand where he's coming from, that you won't judge. It's you two against the issues, not each other. You're a team. \n\nThat's understandable. Like I said, I think it has less to do with his feelings for you (which seem pretty strong) and more to do with his fear of changes in general. I'm sure he'd be more than happy to reassure you on these points if you told him you were feeling insecure about it meaning that he's not sure about you etc.",

                "body": "Hey OP, so this just happened to me actually and my girlfriend dumped me. 25m 24f, kept pressuring me into popping the question even though we\u2019d only been dating for a year, wanted to move in before we got engaged, pushed many things outside of just this, wanted this super serious picture. \n\nFor the record, I wanted all of those things - the serious relationship, the wedding, shared space, shared pet etc. But when someone pushes you on something and you\u2019ve voiced concern, you feel invalidated and yes, steamrolled. \n\nI told her we needed to wait, and focus on our connection because at a point it felt like she wanted the timeline and the things (ring, attention from a wedding) more than she wanted me as a person. She broke up with me, and I hope she finds what she\u2019s looking for now on the timeline she wants. \n\nYou should analyze whether you love this man, or you love the idea of your timeline. If you love this man, you can say to him: I love you for you, no matter the timeline, you know where I stand, and when you\u2019re ready to commit I want to take that leap with you. And then, in a non manipulative way, I would recommend giving him that emotional space to take that leap. Not sure what that looks like and I believe it\u2019s not manipulation. He is saying all the things that indicate that he too wants what you want - he just needs the space to pursue you on a timeline that makes him feel comfortable. You already are at the point where you\u2019re ready - you have to wait for him to be ready. \n\nMarriage is only a two yes situation. Both people have to make that leap. \n\nHowever if you make the decision that you want your timeline - break up with him. Just keep in mind the man you get on your timeline might not nearly have the connection you have with this man, nor be the quality of man that you have right now. And your life might not look like how you are envisioning it will be. But it sounds like that\u2019s the risk you\u2019ll have to take if you want things exactly how you want it when you want it.",

There is nothing wrong with that, where the pressuring may come in is that it sounded kind of like an ultimatum. Not in a mean way, again I think these conversations are hard to have. \n\nOn top of that, if he didn\u2019t propose at the end of this year, how would you feel? Would you stay? I know what you said in your post, however is that where you truly draw the line? It can be scary to restart. On the same note, don\u2019t let your boyfriend keep you from your husband. But genuinely, if he does not propose, are you leaving? And is marriage a common goal for the both of you? Some people do not aspire to be married, it scares them. \n\nMy suggestion is to dig deeper and have these tough conversations now, is marriage a common goal? What do your timelines look like and where do they differ? What can you both do to continue to move forward to these goals as a couple? Therapy may be something to look into as well. There is no shame in having a completely unbiased mediator in these conversations. They are hard and sometimes awkward. But all of the hard conversations now mean less issues in the future imo. Less disagreements come up when you\u2019re both on the same page. \n\nI wish you the best! Whatever that may be \u2764\ufe0f",

In my experience, the transition from earlier talks to actually thinking about buying a ring, planning an engagement, and making a commitment to my partner for the rest of my life felt overwhelming and there was a lot of weight on my shoulders - it\u2019s one of the biggest decisions two people will make that changes the course of their entire life. With that said, anxiety is caused by inaction. Once I started actually making plans, looking at rings, finding the perfect one, it was a time of reflection for myself to realize I wanted nothing and no one else. Actually going through the process gave me clarity. Give him some time, address how he feels and how you support his decision either way and want him to feel safe and how it\u2019s his choice at the end of the day. He\u2019s probably soul searching before a huge commitment, and he\u2019ll find his way. That was my experience, and every day since has been filled with such joy, excitement and love. Good luck!",

        "text": "I just need to get this out of my chest because I feel like I cannot tell this to anyone clearly because I don't want people to have bad image for him. (He's not bad it's just that our relationship is complicated). He's the most perfect man for me and he gave me evrytg and even more i could get from a relationship. \n\nSo, I've been dating him since I was 17. He's a year older than me. We live in same city. I was in school and he just completed school. We were in same college(different courses) and last year he graduated and i completed my 3rd year just now. Since last year he's working. He went to different cities 2-3 times for a few months and we survived long distance. Later he worked in our city for few months and we were together all the time. (fights like a normal relationship in between). But we knew we had to stick together. \n\nWhat happened recently, is that we got into a fight last month and we're not talking properly since 1 month and few days. Talked in between a few times but that also turned into more arguments. In between this time, he went to another city for job. I wasn't involved in anything and that's why i was feeling very bad because I was there with him evrytime. \nThe last time I talked to him a few days back.. We were talking and i wanted to talk about what caused the fights and how it started and I know it was all his mistake so maybe i was trying to get him accept. Whenever i do he says I've already said sorry about that and I just want to keep bringing up fights. Instead I just wanted acceptance. Actually I said that I don't want to be with him anymore (because i was just tired not because i stopped loving him). And he got angry all of a sudden and when I kept arguing he told me \"I'm in office not at home and I don't have free time to fight only\". That somewhere triggered me. He swore he didn't mean anything wrong just i was arguing him with past one hour. But why we were talking in his office time? Because he said. He said he has to wakeup early and get to bed early as per his new schedule so he won't have time after going home. \n\nI feel like I have fought for this relationship with myself more than I have fought with him. He has been there too. He even called 2-3 times after that but I didn't answer. I know he loved me and maybe still do or not i don't know. But I deleted our pictures in our last month fight and I still somewhere feel ki if evrytg has gone right.. We can have a nice future ahead. I know I'm too young. I know what i have to do and life doesn't stop. But when I see high school couples. I feel like yes even I got that luck where I was loved equally. And in this time genuinely everybody knows how difficult it is to trust anyone. I have invested 4.5 years and he has too. We know each other so well. And tbh i don't have this much time to invest on anyone and i guess i never will. And Noone has in my age. Whatever happened, happend. But it can't happen again. That's why I don't know what to do. Because sometimes I want his support. But it is not in my hand anymore. He's not ready to argue and I can't talk without sorting all the arguments. I have opened my heart and everything in front of him. Maybe it's just not the right time or situation.\n---\n\n**TL;DR;** : I'm confused because me and my partner are not working together anymore because of long distance, differences and fights. Although somewhere we care about each other still. It's a 4.5 year long relationship and I need advice if I should continue or end it. \n\nThank you if you read this far, I would like to read your advices. ",

        "text": "Hello Reddit community, I came to talk about my relationship with my girlfriend. I'm really confused on what to do and I really need some advice. So, I'm in high school. My Girlfriend is an awesome person who is always nice and always supportive. We've been dating for about 9-10 months. This is an incredibly long time, and I've been grateful to have a girlfriend for this long. There has been a long going problem that I've never tried fixing because I never wanted to hurt her feelings.\n\nFor a while now, I\u2019ve started to lose interest in dating her. Don\u2019t get me wrong, and I\u2019ll say it again, she is an amazing person, but I\u2019ll tell you why I\u2019m starting to lose interest. I\u2019ve never told her, but me and my girlfriend have a different sense of humor. I never want to sound selfish, but, I do like a girl who can make me laugh, and my girlfriend has just never made me genuinely laugh. It\u2019s always been a forced laugh because I don\u2019t want her to feel bad. When I asked her to first start dating me, it was a confusing time, we had a class together, she liked the same movie I liked, she gave me some snacks in that class, I watched the movie sitting next to her one time. But then all of my friends continued and continued pressuring me on to ask her to date me. And I will say, I was happy that I got to start dating someone, but I didn\u2019t really get to have a lot of time thinking about wanting to ask her to be my girlfriend. It just kinda happened because I asked her after my football game when I had a good amount of energy and pressure from my friends to ask her to be my girlfriend.\n\nShe is a nice person, and I would like to have a girlfriend. It\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know if I waited way too long to tell her that I\u2019m just not feeling in love with her after she thinks that I\u2019m totally in love with her. It\u2019s gotten to the point where, and I know this is bad, I don\u2019t respond to her FaceTimes on purpose. I\u2019m just confused and lost. There have been moments at my school with other girls where they say things that are funny to me and make me genuinely laugh and have a good time when I\u2019m hanging out with everybody. This may sound like a picky thing, but a lot of times I\u2019m the one who has to start the conversation with my girlfriend. If it\u2019s starting to get quiet, or we\u2019re walking together, I have to make a funny remark to spark the convo. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t a time we\u2019re I was thinking about her in my sleep or thinking about her all day. It just kinda happened you could say. My girlfriend means a lot to me, and she is a a very nice and supportive person, but I\u2019m just not feeling in love, you know? And I feel like being deeply in love with your girlfriend is the reason you have a relationship. Right? Also, she has a ton of friends at my school, and some of her friends, (the ones who gossip a lot), I feel like would spread a bad word about me around the school if I broke up with her. They would say stuff like, \u201cWhy would you break up with her? She\u2019s such an amazing person\u201d or \u201cshe is such a kind and supportive person, why would you break up with her\u201d? And they would say that stuff trying to make me look like a horrible person. And I know that I should never be scared about people tryna make me look like I\u2019m a horrible person and spreading rumors. But, I like to be friends with everybody, and I don't want to be looked at as a jerk, You know? \n\nI\u2019m 16, so I got a long road ahead. But any input from all you guys on Reddit would be really helpful and appreciated. I would love to be friends with her if we weren\u2019t dating, but I just don\u2019t know what to do. There\u2019s probably more stuff I could say I\u2019m confused about, but I\u2019ll leave it at that. I\u2019m pretty lost when it comes to relationships, so let me know what you guys think about my situation. Thanks for reading all of this!\n\nTL;DR!- I\u2019m starting to lose feelings and interest in my girlfriend, but she still has feelings for me. I\u2019m very confused about what to do In my situation. \n",

Any differences or issues should be addressed and resolved between both of you together.",

This will also show you who your real friends are because they'll try to understand you. Good luck.",

I love him to bits and he\u2019s my bestfriend I couldn\u2019t imagine being with anyone else. However lately I\u2019ve been missing being young and having that excitement and lust when first starting a relationship. Being in the chase and not being able to keep your hands off eachother. Getting excited when they message etc. I have been watching a lot of enemy to lovers type movies and young adult romance movies so maybe it\u2019s my own fault. I\u2019ve told him that I want more passion more excitement etc. I even suggested going to a bar, acting like strangers and picking eachother up but he said that was a stupid idea and he didn\u2019t want to do that. We are trying for another baby so we are having plenty of sex but it\u2019s boring and routine I want spicy. It makes me want to go back in time and relive those moments with him.  I\u2019m at a loss we still have our whole lives together\n\nTL;DR; missing that feeling of being young and full of lust and passion. I want that passion back. My partner won\u2019t do anything to bring it back. \n \nwhat if we never get that spark back?\n\nWhat if I keep feeling this need for lust and excitement?\n\nHow can I bring it back?",

Your relationship will just evolve over time. \n\nThere will be times it's boring, or stressful, or not much going on, then there's the flip side where things are exciting or there's stuff happening. It all depends on what you both have going on in your life at the time. If you're going to be with someone for a lot of years, you're going to have some dull periods.\n\nThe honeymoon phase is great, no doubt about that, but I think it's far more beautiful to be able to have an ever-evolving, flourishing relationship that ebbs and flows.\n\nBottom line is that this is completely normal, and as long as you guys put in the work, you'll be fine :)",

When I ask what\u2019s wrong or if she is okay she says that she does not want to talk about it. She also says that she doesn\u2019t want to think about it. This makes me overthink a ton because I obviously want to respect her but at the same time I can\u2019t help but wonder what is wrong. \n\n\nShe assures me that it has nothing to do with me or us but rather something she would rather handle by herself.

She is also not the type of person who would cheat and I know that a lot of people probably do say that but if she did I would know because our best friends are all couples in the same friend group as us. \n\nTL;Dr:\nMy girlfriend has been upset about something and does not want to share with me.

One year in is fairly serious and I'm not saying that she's obligated to share what's going for her, but at some point claiming that her upset isn't anything to do with you or 'us' is pretty unfair because even if she wants to handle it herself its still impacting you.\n\nI don't think its healthy to try and force the issue in any case - its really a question of are you comfortable giving space and carrying on since she has taken this stance or do you think this might be a compatibility issue and move on? \n\nYou guys are quite young so I wouldn't really pounce on this - but generally this is pretty emotionally immature thing on her part, and you're not overreacting - gotta love people who express they're upset but \"don't wanna talk about\" (so why bring it up then??)\n\nFrom what you're saying it doesn't sound like your GF is trying to give you the runaround or emotionally manipulate but that can be the effect of what she's doing.",

Won\u2019t date a smoker, someone who gambles, someone who road rage\u2019s, someone who\u2019s messy, someone who calls their mom every morning and night. \n\nWhatever it is, you\u2019re entitled to that preference when you\u2019re choosing partners.\n\nWe are not entitled to others or how they act. You\u2019re giving this man something whether it\u2019s love, affection, your time, sexual satisfaction, or whatever. And in return you\u2019re asking him to alter the way he\u2019s living his life and what he does. \n\nThat is an extremely unhealthy way to approach relationships and you should try to avoid doing it in the future. \n\nCut your ties with this guy, go find someone that already fit into your mold of what you want in a partner and start there. Trying to turn people into your perfect partner is cruel and causes a lot of pain and suffering in both of your lives that neither of you deserve. You need to have more self assurance in what you want and then you need be patient enough to wait for the right one.\n\nAlternatively you can take a step back and try to come at the entire thing from a different angle where you aren\u2019t forcing him to meet your standards so that he can be with you.",

Based just on whatyou wrote I would not move together with him to a place where you have no support system or connections.\n\n2) Does he actually have a substance abuse problem or is that just your perception? Someone having a drink occasionally or smoking some weed occasionally is far from a problem, but it can become a problem. It seems like any smoking is a problem for you (understandable as a recovering addict, good for you and good luck with that), and that he lied and didn\u2018t quit when he said he would, so like why give him another chance? He already made it clear he would lie and go behind your back, if he didn\u2018t wanna quit completly he could have told you that he doesn\u2018t have a Problem bit likes to smoke from time to time (that would have been his decision, but to lie to you\u2026).\n\nIn the end it\u2018s your decision and hard to say as an outsider, I don\u2018t know what would be dealbreakers in a relationship for you (like for me the smoking wouldn\u2018t be a problem, but the lieing about it would). Good luck either way. Maybe talk things through with him, it\u2018s not like you need to make a decision right this moment but I would hold off with moving until you are sure.",

                "body": "We need specific examples. Passive aggression isn't inherently bad - much like compromising, people have different ways of expressing themselves, and sometimes expressing frustration passively can still convey how someone feels, in a way that otherwise would result in more active aggression.\n\nAt the same time if you don't like it, that's fair enough, but there can be a lot of overlap between \"I don't like it when you say X / talk that way\" and tone policing, or being controlling, like \"you must express yourself how I dictate, rather than how you'd prefer to.\"\n\nSarcasm for example - I'm naturally sarcastic. Not in a mean/personal way, like \"well done, genius\" if someone messes up, but if someone asks a silly question, like \"are you about to inflate your tyre\" if I'm holding a bike pump, I'm near-guaranteed to answer along the lines of \"no, I was on my way to paint the ceiling\" or similar. My wife's not a big fan of that, I know it. But it's also just...what I'm like, and she knows that too, and married me regardless. So I make a sarcastic comment, she does a performative sigh, then I answer the question properly (sometimes). I make an effort not to do it as much as I would otherwise, and she knows that, so lets it slide when it happens. We've talked about it, it's not a big deal.\n\nSame thing could happen here - *at a time when you're both content* bring up to your wife that you've noticed occasional passive aggression, and just...discuss it. Which means hearing her out, not starting from the position \"my acceptable end goal is she never does it\". She might do it because she's tried addressing things with you directly and got nowhere, so this is her only option. As I say, we need examples. She might do it without realising she does it or how it makes you feel. Approach it neutrally, focusing on how it makes you feel, **not** making assumptions about how she's feeling or her intent behind it.\n\nFirst and foremost tackle this as you and her vs. the issue, not you vs. her.",

        "text": "TL;DR:\nF20 in a relationship with F19 for 8 months. After my grandma died, I developed anxiety and became emotionally dependent on my girlfriend. She broke up with me because she felt smothered, then admitted she secretly met with her ex twice behind my back using fake excuses. After some emotional talks and her blocking him, we got back together. Now I\u2019m struggling with trust issues and fear she might lie again. Her mom even helped her hide the meetups. I love her, but I\u2019m unsure how to move forward.\nHow can we rebuild trust? Is it normal to question my feelings?\n--------------------\n\nHeyy Guys!\n\nI really need an advice rn. Soo: Im F20 and Im in a relationship with F19. We are 8 months together. Our relationship was full with passion and love, until something happened.\n\nMy Grandma died 3 weeks ago. And I've never been the same since then. I got trust Issues and was scared to lose my girlfriend. I wanted to spend every minute with her because It felt like I was only doing good when she was around. But.. We all know.. This isnt good for a relationship. \nA week after my Grandma died, a friend of hers texted her \"Heyy your ex wants me to tell you, He wants to talk with you\". I said \"No\" Immediatly because I was jealous. They came 3 times back together and I thought he would try something and wants her back. She told me she won't text him. You should remember it.\n\nThen my Problems got bigger and bigger until last sunday. She broke up with me because I was too much. She didnt have freetime or alonetime. She felt like in a cage with me. And she told me.. She met him behind my back. Two times. One time when she told me she meets a friend, which was okay for me. And the other time we were talking and she was like: She has to go soon because her Mum wants to go shopping with her. But when she told me that It was no big Deal for me. Of course I was hurt, but then it was okay. I was focused on improving myself. I wanted her back. And so.. she texted me tuesday morning (3am). She missed me and wanted me there. She was crying and didnt sleep the night. She was going to the burial with me to be my Support on this day. After the burial we talked and she told me she still loves me. So we came back together.\n\nNow to the Point with her Ex: She told me he tried to get her back as soon as she told him we broke up. He didnt even cared about her feelings. She told him she is hurt because of the break up but he just asked everyday if he gets a chance. And soo she told me she wants to quit contact with him. She did it in the evening and showed me how she blocked him. \n\nBut now to the main reason why I text here: \nShe lied to me because she was scared of my reaction. She knows im scared of her meeting up with him because I dont trust him (And now I know Im right). But thats not the problem. The problem is that she created a good Story or a good excuse to meet up with him. She told me I can join her and her friend when they meet up if its okay for her. But then a day before she told me its not okay for her. I was fine with it. And when she was \"with her mum\", I saw random that I cant see her location. I gave her my GPS on Snap map a while ago and she did it too. But now I couldnt see it. I asked her about it and she lied to me that someone texted her her Adress and she turned it off because of it. But the craziest part is.. Her mother told her to do it. She supported her to meet up with her ex behind my back.\n\nAnd now how do I feel? I feel betrayed and Im scared she will do it again. I love her, thats why we back together. But I cannot trust her yet. She tries to reassure me that she won't do it again but there was some more times when she broke my trust. But there it wasnt as Bad as now. And I just dont know how to handle this situation.\n\nSo my questions are: Do you guys have any advice for me? How can we build our trust again? And is it normal to doubt my feelings and our relationship?\n\nLet me know. I would be thankful.\n",

        "text": "I\u2019m (21M) writing this because I don\u2019t really know what to do anymore, and I just need to get some of this off my chest.\n\nLately, it feels like my girlfriend (21F) is actively looking for reasons to get annoyed or upset with me. I try to be respectful, caring, and honest with her, but no matter what I do, something seems to always set her off.\n\nOne example that really stuck with me was when a girl at school tried to get my Snapchat. I said, \u201cNo sorry, I have a girlfriend,\u201d because I didn\u2019t want to be rude. I told my girlfriend about it because I wanted to be transparent, but instead of appreciating the honesty, she got mad at me for saying \"sorry.\" I tried to explain over and over that I just didn't want to be mean, but she wouldn\u2019t hear it. She ignored me for days and when we were out in public during that time, she started pushing me randomly when people were nearby and yelling things like, \u201cStop touching me!\u201d or \u201cGet away creep!\u201d It felt like a joke to her, but it was incredibly humiliating for me. She didn\u2019t seem to care.\n\nAnother time, I talked briefly to one of her friends about an assignment we had together. I asked when she thought her part would be done, since mine depended on it. That was it. But when my girlfriend found out, she ghosted me for days. Then I find out she had an 8-hour FaceTime call with one of my friends, someone who clearly has a thing for her and doesnt hide it. When I brought it up, she claimed it was for their school project... but both of them were done with it many days prior, i got that confirmed by their 3rd partner on the project.\n\nShe\u2019s made it clear that I shouldn\u2019t interact with her friends at all, fine, I\u2019ve respected that. But she talks and flirts with my friends constantly, especially one guy who everyone knows is a bit nasty and who has openly flirted with her. She clings to him and jokes around with him all the time, and it just feels like a slap in the face. The double standard is crushing.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m asking for, maybe just some perspective. Has anyone been in a relationship like this? How do you even know when it\u2019s time to let go?\n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far. It\u2019s been heavy on my mind for a while.\n\nTL;DR: It\u2019s starting to feel like I\u2019m not allowed to breathe without upsetting her. She gets upset with my for the smallest reasons, there were plenty i didnt write down, trust me. And the worst part is, I still love her so much. But I don\u2019t know if this is healthy. It\u2019s like a loop: she gets annoyed or mad, I get sad and feel unappreciated, and then nothing really gets resolved. I try to show her love, affection, and loyalty every day, but it\u2019s like none of that gets seen.",

        "text": "The situation: I [23F] have been with my boyfriend [27M] for almost 3 years. The last year has been long-distance, but we\u2019ve been planning for me to move to London after I finish university so we can start our life together. We\u2019re both excited about the future\u2014living together, building a life, and eventually having a family. At least, that\u2019s what I thought.\n\nThe other night, I asked him a hypothetical question: \u201cIf I couldn\u2019t have children, would you still want to be with me?\u201d His answer? He\u2019s not sure, because he really wants biological children of his own.\n\nWe\u2019re both healthy as far as we know, and we\u2019re not planning to start a family anytime soon. But his answer hit me hard. Being a mom is something I have a strong desire for, probably even stronger than his. I realized that I would most likely stay with him if the situation were reversed. I\u2019d be open to IVF, adoption. Because to me, being with him matters more than genetics.\n\nThis made me step back and ask: Are we equally committed? I\u2019m getting ready to uproot my entire life\u2014leave behind family, friends, and career opportunities\u2014to be with him in a city I wouldn\u2019t have chosen otherwise. That already feels like a huge personal sacrifice. But now I\u2019m wondering\u2026 what if something goes wrong? What if I make this move and he walks away when life throws us a curveball? \n\nIt was honestly an eye-opener. I love him deeply. But if I\u2019m willing to go all in, shouldn\u2019t he be willing to do the same?\n\n\nThe outcome I want:\n I want to continue my life with him, but I need the reassurance that my sacrifices won\u2019t be wasted.\n\nWhen and how should I approach a future conversation about my concerns? \n\nTL;DR:\nBeen with my boyfriend for 3 years, long-distance for the past year. Planning to move to London to live with him soon\u2014a big life and career sacrifice for me. Asked him if he\u2019d still want to be with me if I couldn\u2019t have children. He said he\u2019s not sure because he wants biological kids. Now I\u2019m questioning whether we\u2019re equally committed and if I should be worried about making such a big move for someone who might not stay through tough times. When and how should I approach a future conversation about my concerns? \n",

She said if it turned out they couldn't have kids, she would regret marrying him.\n\nThey had kids, but I feel awful for him knowing that he will always be a means to an end for her.\n\nAt least he's being honest with you. He doesn't want you as a life partner and spouse, he wants you as the mother of his children. And if he doesn't get that, he doesn't want you. He's not in it for better or worse, for richer or poorer. He's looking for a somewhat transactional relationship. Lots of people have transactional relationships. And there is nothing wrong with that, as long as everyone's clear about it, and don't hide the fact. \n\nYou say, if I'm willing to go all in, shouldn't he too? No. He's telling you, no matter what you do, he will not be all in. If you have a miscarriage he might give you another shot. But if you cannot carry a child to term, he will find someone who can. \n\nIf you're okay with those terms, proceed with the relationship. If you're not, don't try to change his mind. Be grateful that he actually told what many people hide. If it's not what you want, break up.\n\nYou want him to be the person you imagine him to be, not the person he is. He's telling you who he is. You're arguing that he shouldn't be that person, he should be who you want. You don't get to dictate that. All you can do is decide if what he is offering is what you want, or if you want to find someone more compatible.",

He may not know, but he picks up on the fact that she doesn't feel the way about him that he feels about her. They fight and bicker constantly. \n\nUnsurprisingly, having kids wasn't actually the key to long lasting happiness. That's because if you don't know how to be happy on your own, no one will be able to make you happy. Her kids aren't babies anymore, but real people with their own personalities and needs, and she resents them too because they didn't make her happy the way she wanted. \n\nShe is essentially a very selfish person, who was fine using someone to get what she wanted, and to discard them if she didn't. She doesn't see anything wrong with that, and treats other people like that too. She is worse than your boyfriend because she KNOWS he is a means to an end, but she lets him think it's real love. \n\nDon't fall for it that this is the only place where your boyfriend would be selfish and transactional in the relationship. If he thinks it's fine to marry to get kids, and then leave them if kids aren't possible, will he be fine if you get sick and can't fulfill his sexual needs for a time? Do you think in old age he will stick with you if you get sick and can no longer take care of him? Did you know that men are six times more likely to leave their wife if she gets a cancer diagnosis than a woman is to leave a man? It's such a common occurrence that oncologists warn women about it. That's because those men see their wife as a means to an end of getting their needs met, not as a true partner. \n\nIf you have daughters would you want them to marry and give their life to someone who will divorce them if they have a miscarriage? Is that what you would want them to think their worth is?",

But then two seconds later he say he used the wrong words or he didn't mean what he said. He claims he has difficulty finding the right words.

He will take that perceived attack to his character as a betrayal, but he won\u2019t have the words or understanding to name what that feeling is. So he lashes out in a fit of rage in an attempt to silence you and make the bad feelings he\u2019s having go away. You\u2019re making him feel uncomfortable emotions and he doesn\u2019t know how to recognize them, so he\u2019s reacting in the only way that he knows how: by throwing a tantrum.

But they can stop the urge to lash out even if they feel hurt, and measure their response. He is lacking emotional regulation skills. He can't feel an emotion and decide whether it's rational or not, he just feels an emotion and acts on it immediately the way a toddler does.\n\nI don't think he means the mean things he says, but the issue is that he keeps saying them. He needs to prepare for the wave of defensive feelings and keep his mouth shut until the emotions subside.\n\nThere isn't much you can do one therapy session in. Because he may do this in therapy too, and be closed feedback and just get defensive.\n\nIn the meantime, he doesn't need to know why he does it, he just needs to know it's wrong to do. He needs to practice some self control and not say the first thing that comes through his head.\n\nWhat would happen if you both managed this reaction by knowing he needs time to let that wave of emotion pass before responding. He knows it's going to come. He knows he shouldn't speak while he's feeling it. Is he not capable of feeling a wave of negative emotion without keeping himself from lashing out?\n\nWork on preparing him for that experience. If you're going to talk to him about something, tell him first \"I need to talk to you about something.\" Let him prepare for the fact that he will have a wave of emotion and he needs to let that pass before you talk. Tell him what you need to, and give him space if he needs before you talk about it calmly.\n\nBecause it doesn't matter if he means it or not, it does harm to say those things out loud to you. It harms your relationship for you to have to hear them. And that harm isn't undone when he takes it back a moment later. If he doesn't want to harm the relationship, he needs to bite his tongue for a few moments and wait until he calms down to speak. Does he think that it doesn't matter what he says in the moment, as long as he takes it back later? Ask him.\n\nHe needs to take therapy serious, share with you what he's learning about himself, and why he does things, and show an ability to change his behavior. He needs to accept his pattern of behavior and work to break the pattern by keeping his mouth shut while he's feeling intense emotion.\n\nWhether or not he does this, and does it successfully, doesn't mean you need to continue in this relationship. Sometimes by the time someone breaks down and accepts help or goes to therapy, the damage is done and the years of refusing to change have taken their toll. He has be willing to damage your relationship over and over through the years, and expected you to just accept it and forget it. That damage is done even if he changes tomorrow.",

Wear you out so bad he emerges new and changed while you get some autoimmune disease or cancer and he abandons you saying your not the girl he fell in love with any more and divorces to remarry someone 15 or 20 years younger who will give his ego the white glove treatment.\n\nThat's just the story I always hear and I find it telling that it took you literally being at the end of your wits with it to even evaluate his own problems.

They simply cannot do it. And personality disorders generally are not fixable. (I'd say the same for adults who are very emotionally immature, in my experience. If that's how they are in their 40s, they aren't going to change.)\n\nIt's good that he has some awareness that he's reacting badly, but if he's not actually taking responsibility for his responses **and** sincerely apologizing to you for the hurt he's causing, that doesn't bode well for his being able to make much progress in therapy, I'm afraid.",

Why not ask how he feels about this style of communication you're having?\n\n  \nTexting gives us the ability to instantly respond to people. But that doens't mean people are going to sit on their phones and immediately text back, or text all the time.\n\nHe could be busy with other things. He could be investing time into video gaming, chores, talking to other friends, who knows.\n\nIf you want to talk to him at a specific time, say that. If you want his undivided attention, ask to call or visit him. But just because someone gets a text from you, doesn't mean you're entitled to a response.

It's a very brutal breakup, with a lot of hurt feelings. I am living in the house, and she has moved out. She hasn't lived here for 3 months.\n\nOur lease is up, and I've chosen to move into a new place. We lived here for 4 years and I just can't live in this house anymore-- want to start out fresh. I told her in email and verbally that she has until May 30th to remove her things from the house. She still has a bed, a dresser, and some clothing.\n\nShe is emotionally unstable in some ways, and tends to be controlling. She hasn't spoken to me in over 2 weeks. Obviously, I'm on edge because when is she coming to get her things? I think it's part of her controlling nature. Also, I cannot just throw her things to the curb legally. I'll have to get a storage unit and move the things for 14 days to the unit to protect myself legally (if she doesn't get her things.)\n\nI know that if I email her, she'll just ignore the email but at this point I really just wish she could communicate. Any advice would be great, thanks\n\nTLDR: my ex 40 F and I are moving out of the home we share. I've been living her, she has not for 3 months.

        "post-author": "Fuzzy_Zebra4723",
        "text": "This is gonna be a long one but here\u2019s the context to the situation first:\n\nMy (25f) fianc\u00e9 (26m) told me that he\u2019s not attracted to me and doesn\u2019t love me anymore. We have been together for 4 years, lived together for 3, and everything had been great until a few months back. He stopped doing little things for me like giving me a kiss before leaving for work (something he had done every morning since we started dating) and when I asked him about it the first time he said he forgot the past few mornings because he\u2019s been stressed about work etc. Then when I brought it up again, he told me he felt like it was too much effort. At this point, I was concerned because this was very out of character for him. I honestly thought he was falling into a depression and wrote off a lot of what was going on because we had three years of him being considerate and loving. There were definitely signs in the past few months, but I didn\u2019t think it was because he didn\u2019t love me anymore.\n\nHe started acting hyper critical towards me, commenting on everything I did wrong, telling me everything I do is wrong, etc. It hit a boiling point when we were driving home from his family\u2019s and he looked like he was going to be sick (he ended up having a severe migraine which we found out after I took him to the hospital). The reason I took him to the hospital is because he started swearing at me on the way home (something he had never done before). It scared me. I told the nurses and doctors about it, thinking it was a symptom of some kind of medical emergency. Later, on the drive home, he told me to stop telling people that he swore at me because they would think he was abusive. I told him that I wouldn\u2019t stop telling people and if it wasn\u2019t a symptom then it was not okay and if he ever did that again I would leave him. In retrospect, that\u2019s when he started to become way more distant. Nothing I did was good enough. If I cooked supper, it was overdone, if I cleaned the house, I forgot to fold a blanket, I couldn\u2019t do something good without him commenting on something that wasn\u2019t quite right. I confronted him about this and he was apologetic but it started back up again pretty soon after.\n\nFinally, I sat him down and asked what was going on. He acted like he didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. I went through everything that had been going on and he just sat there in silence. I asked him if he had any kind of response or reasoning behind this and he just said \u201cI dunno\u201d. I should have taken this as his answer, but I genuinely thought he had something going on. I just wanted to support him. After a long discussion, we went through things that he needed to change and things that I could do to support him. We also decided to go camping as a way to try to rekindle things.\n\nWe went camping this past weekend and it was fun. Something was off about him all weekend but when I asked, he told me it was nothing and he was just trying to enjoy himself. So I left it. I didn\u2019t push and just tried to have a nice time. Once we got back and had finished cleaning up, he came and sat down on the couch next to me. He asked me what I thought about camping and I told him I enjoyed myself but that something seemed off about him. That\u2019s when he told me that he wasn\u2019t sure about us. He told me he\u2019s not attracted to me anymore and he\u2019s not sure if he loves me. A very long, very emotional conversation ensued where I kept asking him to clarify things and he kept answering \u201cI dunno\u201d. He told me he hasn\u2019t been attracted to me in a while and that I\u2019m not sexy enough. I haven\u2019t gained any weight or really changed anything about myself physically and so I asked him what about me he was no longer attracted to and he couldn\u2019t give me an answer. He told me there was just something missing. Finally, I asked him if he still loved me and he said he didn\u2019t think so. I looked and him and said \u201cso things are over?\u201d And he said \u201cyeah\u201d. He slept on the couch that night and left for work early. \n\nI spent the entire next day completely broken. I have never felt that kind of hurt before. I sobbed all day and couldn\u2019t get myself to stop. I spent the day with family and they helped me get my thoughts together. We planned out what I would say and do for pretty much any scenario. The only way I would let myself give him a chance is if he apologized profusely, initiated going to therapy and recognized everything wrong with himself and what he did. All of this without any prompting from me. Well, that\u2019s exactly what happened and more. I had never seen him so broken. \nHe told me that everything he said was a mistake and not true. That he was afraid of marriage and didn\u2019t know how to confront that. He told me he was looking for a therapist that specialized in family trauma and attachment styles and that he would do anything for a chance to try and fix things. I told him that we could try to fix things but that I had no guarantee that I\u2019d be able to move past what happened. That only time would tell. I told him the wedding was still off, that we were no longer engaged, and that the relationship is taking a major step back. That we\u2019re not just starting up where we left off. \n\nNow I\u2019m torn. I love him, but I also recognize that love isn\u2019t enough. I do believe that this was a major wake up for him and that he will follow through with everything he said. But I\u2019m just so embarrassed. I\u2019m cancelling things like my wedding dress and the venue and I feel so lost. I want things to work out, but either way I\u2019m embarrassed about a failed engagement and failed wedding. If we hadn\u2019t been engaged, this wouldn\u2019t be so public and I think it would have been a lot easier to deal with. But my family, his family, and friends all know about this and that\u2019s what I hate the most. I hate having my personal life and struggles out there for everyone to judge. The worst part for me is that the embarrassment is there whether we work things out or not. So how the hell do I come back from this?\n\nTLDR: He broke up with me, realized it was a mistake and is now making steps to fix everything. The wedding is off and I\u2019m embarrassed.",

If someone acts selfishly and can't communicate, they're not good for anyone. Why give a bad person a second chance? Grieve the relationship you had, and don't grieve the person who he became. He chose to grow apart. I'm sure you have some part in things not working, and you should take the time to learn from it and become a better person. Know that who you are in love with isn't the man today. You are in love with the man you first met. When it comes to relationships, second chances VERY rarely work out. It's rare enough that most people will never meet someone who has had a second chance to work. You have better odds playing the lottery. Besides, why would you date an asshole? \n\nHit the gym, read, mourn the relationship, and give yourself time to reflect and grow.

She pushes more and more for a ring. The issue is, every time these \"forever\" events get discussed, my mind goes to all the things she does that drive me insane or make me insecure about the relationship.\n\nFor instance, I am very extroverted. I need to be social and hang out with friends or I get very withdrawn and short with people. However, she does not want to go out and do those things regularly. She needs a week to get enough social energy for a few hours out. The issue comes when I make commitments to things that do not involve her that take me out of the house (social organizations, etc.) then all I hear is how much she misses me and wishes I was home. I cannot be home as much as she wants me to be and support my mental health but if I am not home, I hear about how she and the dogs miss me and she will be glad when I am done with this activity so I am home again.\n\nI NEED this social stimulation and I understand that she NEEDS to not feel pressured to be social. She has suggested on occasion joining me at some of my events but she wants to get there at the start time and leave either before or as soon as things wrap up because her battery is spent. That cuts into the social aspect for me because its the socialization before and after that really make the events enjoyable.\n\nI cannot imagine starting over again without her, but I also cannot picture a future where I am stuck at home for fear of being nagged about going out again.\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : My GF is an introvert and I am an extrovert.

It\u2019s not just an \u201cI\u2019ll be excited to see you.\u201d\n\nBut he's talked in a comment about some of these activities being a long weekend. That drastically changes the context of her being glad when the activity is done. \"I can't wait til the weekend long convention is done and you come home\" is super different than \"I can't wait until your 1.5hr movie is done and you can come home\". \n\n>Also I wouldn\u2019t jump to say OP is wrong for his assumption, as it\u2019s likely based on more information than the little bit we were given here.\n\nSee, but I'm judging based on what he's written and the context of the situation that he has provided, you're judging based on his provided assumptions about the situation. If he wants real advice here, if he is open at all to trying to make this work, then he needs to see all sides and interpretations of the issue. And a very real, very honest interpretation is that he is choosing to hear the worst in what she is saying, which is why I am so staunchly defending that the wording choice provided is not, in and of itself, bad, pressure-y, or pushy. My partner has said some variation of this sort of thing  to me a hundred times, and I've never once interpreted or 'heard' that he was pressuring me to come home, or trying to guilt me. \n\nIf he is hearing or seeing resentment that is external to the words and example he provided to us, I would get it completely (though then we go right back to him needing to talk to her about this ages Ago), but if there is only these written words, then as I said, he is choosing to see the worst in his partner rather than give her the benefit of the doubt. And again, I am going 100% on what is provided to us, not his assumptions of her. So If he chooses to interpret her words in the worst possible way, and doesn't tell her that he has done so, and then builds himself up internally to the point he is seriously thinking about leaving her due to his interpretation of the worst possible meaning of her words, then he needs to grow the heck up tbh. \n\nAnd yeah, he's come back to the post to answer questions but hasn't replied to older ones asking directly about her response when he discussed this with her, hence why I'm fairly positive he hasn't. I'm very open to being corrected though, of course.",

I'm realising though, by dissecting this more with you, that I see him as an unreliable narrator, as he seems very much to not have just talked to her about his feelings, and is just stewing in silent resentment of her actions. This reads entirely to me that there is a mismatch that he privately resents her for, and that she has absolutely no idea and is just going on with her life wondering why he isn't as committed to her as she is to him. If he hasn't spoken to her about any of this, then we again come back into a similar style of argument we had prior, where it's 'well if you haven't even asked her, then how do you know her intention at all?\"\n\nMy opinion on all of this would swing drastically the other way, aligning much closer to yours, if he confirmed he's spoken to her and worked on the issue, and she's not changed the behaviour which is why he's here, I can see now. \n\nHard disagree on the dog thing though, since we clearly haven't disagreed on enough yet lol. Regular overstimulation in ones life is too often a (possibly undiagnosed) symptom of a variety of things, such as but certainly not limited to ADHD, and some people just aren't as good of a pet owner as they think and failed in training properly, etc for us to look at and judge her ability to negotiate boundaries on. There are a variety of reasons this might be impacting her life, and we just don't have enough on that one to judge, in my opinion.",

(Not that he ever claimed he had, I don\u2019t think? I wouldn\u2019t say that failing to realize that makes him an unreliable narrator per se. People can have blind spots, that\u2019s why asking for advice is helpful.

I also think the clues given here do indicate that the gf is likely objectively on the far end of the neediness scale, maybe someone who has trouble regulating her own emotions (due to maybe anxious attachment, or ADHD as you mentioned could be another cause). \n\nI think it\u2019s very likely that both sides have issues. That she is unable to emotionally regulate herself, and places too much expectation on him to do it for her.

That detail shifts the entirety of her actions from a simple mismatch in expectations, to intentionally overriding him and ignoring his needs and wants. If he didn't communicate with her, it changes her entire 'character' that he has painted in his explanations of her in this story from a needy, guilt tripping, codependent, self absorbed individual, into someone who is unwittingly annoying their partner by wanting to spend time with them. That is why I view him as an unreliable narrator, because this woman is either significantly worse than he portrays, or significantly better than he portrays, and whether or not is or isn't, hinges entirely on whether *he* communicated with her or not. \n\n>Where I guess I disagree is with the idea that communication should be some kind of easy fix for this, I think it sounds like a bad situation that is likely not solvable.\n\nBut it *could have been* is more my point. You're right, if he communicated and she ignored it, then communication won't help, and if he hasn't communicated and now does, there is the several added issues that include but aren't limited to her being blindsided, and him being near a breaking point. So you're completely right that communication isn't an easy fix, with the caveat that it isn't an easy fix *anymore.* Mismatches in needs like this, between even just decent communicators, is something you can work on and get through and find a balance, if you're committed to each other. But it's well past that now, I agree with you there. \n\n>I think it\u2019s very likely that both sides have issues.

Her degree to which she cannot emotionally regulate certainly isn't clear, but based on the overstimulation to the dogs that is resolved by playing with them, I absolutely think it's fair to say she needs *some* degree of co-regulation in her life. And he certainly screams of someone who shuts down and pulls away, in this post, absolutely.",

Long response incoming: \n\n> But he's painting a picture where his partner is intentionally causing issues that he hasn't even said that she is aware of. That detail shifts the entirety of her actions from a simple mismatch in expectations, to intentionally overriding him and ignoring his needs and wants.\n\nSee, here is where I feel like you are now reading in things that aren\u2019t there. I don\u2019t see this anywhere. I see no reference to it being intentional. Just that the situation is a problem for him. In fact, I think it\u2019s likely that her very lack of awareness adds to the problem. She thinks \u201cit\u2019s natural to want to be with your partner right?\u201d When what\u2019s being described is excessive and unhealthy.\n\nBecause I do think it\u2019s excessive and unhealthy. He says she has no real hobbies. What is this? An introvert with no hobbies? It makes no sense. This is a person with an incomplete life who expects him to complete it.  \n\nAlso, re: your saying, \n\n> the overstimulation to the dogs that is resolved by playing with them\n\nSo this is not what he said; he doesn\u2019t say that playing with them resolves it.\n\n> She gets easily overwhelmed when the dogs are needy and they know that pestering her will result in her dropping everything to play with them\n\nThis sounds like a situation where she is overwhelmed by the dogs\u2019 neediness but cannot tell them no. When they want something from her, she feels she has to ignore her own preferences and do whatever they want. \n\nThen, she expects that OP will do the same for her. She doesn\u2019t mean wrong, she just thinks this is how relationships work. But in fact that\u2019s a codependent dynamic.\n\n> That is why I view him as an unreliable narrator, because this woman is either significantly worse than he portrays, or significantly better than he portrays\n\nI don\u2019t agree with this. I think she sounds like a person who has no bad intentions but needs therapy, because her inability to meet more of her needs on her own is depleting her partner. (And OP is not the only person who would be bothered by this situation.)\n\nAbout whether it could ever have been an easy fix, you say: \n\n> But it could have been is more my point. You're right, if he communicated and she ignored it, then communication won't help, and if he hasn't communicated and now does, there is the several added issues that include but aren't limited to her being blindsided, and him being near a breaking point. So you're completely right that communication isn't an easy fix, with the caveat that it isn't an easy fix anymore.\n\nSo, I agree that the situation building over time makes things way worse. But I don\u2019t agree that it would ever have been an easy fix. If you are unable to emotionally regulate by yourself, that is something that takes a lot of work on yourself to fix, quite aside from the communication issue.\n\nIn other words, this sounds to me like something that, to fix, would require both couples therapy for communication AND individual therapy for her. Maybe also individual therapy for him if he is avoidant. I\u2019m not sure quite what OP\u2019s role is in the situation, whether it\u2019s mainly about being a bad communicator or also about being avoidant. If he\u2019s avoidant, that would be exacerbating the situation and making her more anxious (which would then make him more avoidant, it\u2019s a vicious cycle). \n\nI noticed something you said in a different comment:\n\n> My partner and I are both varying degrees of introverted, but we both spend all of our 'alone time', together, just not feeling like we must be engaging, and switched on, and anything outside of just ourselves.\n\nSee this sounds great! But it sounds significantly different from the dynamic that OP is describing.",

It made me cry when he said that. I told him it felt like he wanted me to be someone else. Someone who went out, drank, and was more like him.. he said \u201cno no\u201d. But prior to this, months before, he had also said he was embarrassed by the fact that when he went out without me friends would ask where I was. I had to explain to him that, them asking about me is just social politeness - they are not making hidden commentary on my absence being weird etc like he was assuming. That also really upset me. He would rather me change to appease his friends and insecurities than accept me as I was. It really broke our relationship down.",

I want to go and have enough capacity to go and 2. if I'd rather stay home then what are things I can do to keep myself occupied or maybe have a friend I'm more comfortable with over.  \n\nMe and my boyfriend don't live together but more and more I don't see him because of work and such, I miss him so much and feel like sometimes he doesn't emotionally respond well to me saying that. Instead of thinking that she can't do things or doesn't want you doing things, just allow yourself to understand that she is more emotionally driven. She needs you more and wants to be with you more then you might like. \n\nBut maybe try to have a conversation where you tell her how you've been feeling. Trust me when I tell you; she'll want to hear your side, understand you better and help you.",

I would have a serious talk with her and ask her to work on that part of herself so you guys can both be comfortable when you go out and socialize. Make sure you're also catering to her needs as well and it's not just her doing the work. If she needs reassurance, give it to her (to a certain extent), or whatever she feels like she needs from you in order for her to feel ok and grow out of her current behavior.

        "post-author": "thegeneralvenus",
        "text": "TL;DR: My bf (25M) of one year has been having outbursts at me when he is stressed out. As they add up it is emotionally taxing for me. I want to figure out how to work through this with him because I do love him & he is extremely kind outside of the outbursts.  \n\nMy bf and I have been together a little over a year. I want to preface by saying he is a very kind person and I do love him. I want to figure out how to approach this with him and work it through. There have been multiple instances over the last year where he is either overstimulated or stressed out and if i say something wrong in these moments he gets snippy with me. One of the first times I pointed it out, we had a gathering at his mom\u2019s house for a game night and he was upset he was losing a game. I cheered on his mom and told him he could do .. xyz .. to better his chances and he abruptly in a raised voice said \u201cstop talking to me\u201d. I was shocked because I couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d take a tone like that with me especially infront of his family. I felt extremely embarrassed and just stopped talking the rest of the night. I brought up to him the way I felt and he apologized profusely saying he just gets competitive and caught up in games. \n\nThere have been multiple instances where he abruptly just has a mood switch but I\u2019ve brushed them off. Recently it was my birthday and we were driving in a city. I am originally from a big city and am used to the driving & I suggested I drive but he insisted so I let him. I accidentally told him to get in the wrong lane and he cut someone off to go where I told him and had to get back over. He said \u201cugh now I look like an asshole\u201d. I told him it\u2019s fine everyone makes a wrong turn here and there and everyone is an asshole to someone. I did make a following comment that he was bumper to bumper with another car because I was worried about them braking hard and us rear ending them. After I made the comment he snapped at me and yelled \u201ccan you just let me drive?\u201d I was very upset and my emotions got the best of me so i started tearing up because I was sad it was my birthday and he was ruining my mood & I just stopped talking. He did apologize later that day. \n\nWe\u2019ve had multiple conversations about how I don\u2019t want to be talked to that way by my partner and he always says he\u2019s working on himself and trying. \n\nI do appreciate the apologies but just saying sorry after being mean to me is not cutting it for me. He is working on himself in therapy and I am proud that he is but I don\u2019t want to be on the receiving end of his outbursts. It\u2019s getting harder for me to move past them even after apologies. I\u2019m not sure how to bring this up without discrediting his work in therapy. ",

        "text": "Hello everyone\n\nPlease help, I would really appreciate the help. Have been together for 6 months about to go into 7. Dating for 5 months going into 6. \n\nI truly love this women. I\u2019m trying to figure out how to support my girlfriend the right way without smothering her, overwhelming her, or making her feel like she has to be okay. A few days ago, we had a really honest conversation. She told me she\u2019s been feeling emotionally numb. That she\u2019s lost her spark. And that even when we\u2019re together, sometimes she still feels alone. That hit hard\u2014not because I took it personally, but because I love her and I don\u2019t want her to feel like that, especially not with me. I\u2019m not trying to fix her. I\u2019m not trying to force anything. I just want to be steady, present, and supportive. I know I have my own flaws and I really.\n\nLast night we FaceTimed before bed and she said \u201cI love you\u201d multiple times before falling asleep. Today she was joking with me and laughing, and hearing that laugh meant the world to me. It reminded me that the connection is still there, even if things feel off. I know she\u2019s drained. I can feel it. And I\u2019ve been doing these from the beginning taking her out on dates when I can, writing her love letters, bringing her flowers just because. I don\u2019t do those things to fix her mood. I do them because I want her to feel loved.\n\nThis situation made me realize how much I need to grow. I don\u2019t want to love her with empty words or promises I want to love her with action. I want to change as a man. I want to be more emotionally available. I want to be more thoughtful, more intentional, more grounded. I don\u2019t want to lose her, and I\u2019m not just saying that. I\u2019m doing the inner work.\n\n* How do I keep showing up in a way that gives her peace, not pressure?\n* How can I stay emotionally connected to her when she\u2019s feeling so disconnected from herself?\n* What are the quiet things that matter most to someone who\u2019s going through emotional numbness?\n\nIf you have ever been on either side of this feeling numb yourself, or loving someone who is your advice means a lot.\n\nI\u2019m not here to fix her. I genuinely love this women and I know as a man I need to step up but I am unsure of what to do and how to do it. I know I need to be more present when spending time with her. I really want this women to feel like she on top of the world and truly want her to glow with love and not make her feel like her spark is lost in herself because shes trying to keep the peace in the relationship.\n\nPlease help, I really would appreciate the help. I am afraid to lose this women and I really want to change and truly show her with actions that I love her. I know I am loyal to her and keep my heart loyal to her and always give assurances and communicate, as well as tell her she has a safe space to talk about her feelings.\n\nI know I need to be more present when we spend time together. I really dont want her to feel alone when we are together. Always try to listen to her and stop trying to give solutions to problems. Im afraid to lose this women.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nMy girlfriend recently told me she feels emotionally numb and disconnected\u2014even when we\u2019re together. I love her deeply and I\u2019ve been doing what I can (dates, flowers, love letters) to show her she\u2019s loved. But I know that\u2019s not enough. I want to grow as a man\u2014be more present, more grounded, and support her with real actions, not just words. I don\u2019t want to smother her or pressure her. I just want to be steady and give her peace. I\u2019m scared of losing her, and I\u2019m asking for advice on how to love her the right way through this.",

He doesn\u2019t like her thats for sure and he\u2019s been even trying to ghost her and not text her back when she asks him to go over to his place and she was crying to my other friend because she felt like hes ignoring her. So hes not into her whatsoever but his reasoning is that he feels lonely since im not there and he only has 1 close friend thats always busy. He was hiding that they hang out until I found out when she was talking to my friend over the phone about that. But ofc I was suspicious bc of the way he was acting.\n\nAnyway 1 week after this drama he told me he doesn\u2019t wanna be with me anymore bc of sth I did but it was sth sooo stupid, until now I\u2019m not convinced it really annoyed him but my perspective is that he got bored bc I was always questioning him abt that girl bc he was acting weird!!! I\u2019m not paranoid!!! And my doubts came true at the end when I found out they were hanging out almost everyday. Anyway I said ok fine and I stopped texting him at all, like at first I tried to apologize hoping that it really annoyed him but he wasn\u2019t listening and wanted to end things. Then 3 weeks later he called me apologizing and saying I really love and miss you but I was annoyed by you questioning me all the time.\n\nAnd we\u2019re back together but I\u2019m still so hurt. I feel like he\u2019s never been genuine with me from the way he handled the situation, the way he was talking to me calling me hypocrite and liar (only during our last fight\u2026.he never treated me this way before), telling that gurl I don\u2019t see a future with her (it\u2019s true that we have no future but lately hes been telling me that he\u2019ll try to fix everything so that we can get married bc he loves me and he never said that we have no future so by him saying that and to that gurl made me feel tht he doesn\u2019t care abt me at alll and it feels like hes talking shit abt me) also my friend told me that this girl told her that they kissed and hugged I\u2019m soooo hurt. N.B: I have some issues that will hold me from going to where he is for the next maybe 9 months and maybe more so it\u2019s making things harder\u2026.QUESTION: why did he start talking to me again??? Hes been ghosting her and she calls my friend and cries to her bc of that\u2026.what tf is happening?? I need analysis to that\u2026.hes calling me everyday now exactly like before as if nothing happened\u2026.but I\u2019m 100% sure she still comes over and they hang out but he still hides it\u2026why??? Is this normal bc we\u2019re long distance so it\u2019s fine that he hangs out with her a lot???? I\u2019m so hurt and feel unappreciated\n\nTL;DR: hes been hanging out with another girl bc we\u2019re long distance\u2026.does that justify it??",

        "text": "Sorry if the formatting is wrong this is the first time I\u2019m posting on here.\n\nSo here we go. I (34M) am struggling to figure out why my girlfriend (28F) seems distant.\n\nI have a 16 y/o and she has a 9mo old. My kid is in high school doing his own thing so he\u2019s met her two times, but it went great when they met. Both her and I have very busy work schedules so we only get to see each other once a week or so.\n\nShe is going through child custody case in the courts currently and it has been very stressful for her. I have tried to be as understanding as I can through out this whole process because I have been through these things before with my son. Her baby dad isn\u2019t the most savory person and I know she is scared for the safety of her little.\n\nNow onto the problem. When we are together I feel like we are great. The chemistry is there, the horizontal tango is great, and it seems like we want like things. However, when we aren\u2019t around each other it seems like she\u2019s checked out. I have made plans on multiple occasions and she\u2019s good for it, but then something always comes up. I\u2019ll preference this by she hasn\u2019t lied to me about anything going on and I know she isn\u2019t cheating on me.\n\nA few examples, Firstly Easter. The Saturday before Easter we had my family\u2019s Easter get together. She had just switched lawyers and apparently hand to get something faxed over to her and she was running around that day. I tried to get her to come stay with me the night before so we could make our dishes together for the party. She didn\u2019t want to wake her little up when she got off work, around 9ish, and drive him around that late. So on Saturday she kept on pushing back the time she would get there. Well in the process of running around her engine cover got stuck on something and was dragging. She was scared to drive around with it like that so she said she was going home. (We live 50 minutes apart) I end up driving to her place to be with her that night. She didn\u2019t lie to me and I saw the engine cover.\n\nSecond case was we were supposed to watch Star Wars Episode 3 in theaters ( I\u2019m a big Star Wars fan and so is my son) I had planned this over a month in advance. Come to find out she never requested off for this day so it was a slap in the face to me and once again she dipped out on something where my kid thought she was coming. After this one I told her I was going to take a step back and not plan anything because every time I plan something she ends up backing out.\n\nThird, was this weekend. I had met her when she dropped off her little for visitation with the baby dad so we could spend time together. If I didn\u2019t make time to see her we wouldn\u2019t have seen each other over this past month. We have a good time and we make plans for Memorial Day. My dad is retiring and she had bought a shirt as a retirement gift that she wanted to give to him, and my kid was playing taps and in a parade for Memorial Day. I figured her kid would enjoy the parade and it\u2019s a win win for us. Sunday I went to church with them and we got lunch. Before leaving I had a conversation with her about how I felt like she has been distant from me and how it seems like she checks out when we aren\u2019t around each other in person. She said she understood and would work on it. Plus to top this off we haven\u2019t done the horizontal tango in about a month.\n\nWell I get a message from her around midnight, and asks if I\u2019m still up. I had just woken up so I said yes. Well she called me and she is staying over for a 16 hour shift at work. I was flabbergasted because I had just talked to her before she went into work about how she seemed distant while we weren\u2019t physically around each other. I had no words so I didn\u2019t say anything for 10 seconds and she just hung up on me.\n\nI\u2019ll just include the text back and forth after because it will be easier.\n\nMe: Are you just trying to make me break up with you? I just had a conversation with you about this, literally right before you went into work\n\nHer: You talked to me like a piece of shit for working a double when you know I need to when Im able to. I am at work. I cannot have a fight with you right now, Im sorry. Sorry for being the bad guy.\n\nMe: Excuse me? How did I talk to you like a piece of shit? I once again told Gavin you'd be there and you make me look like an idiot for the 20th time in a row. You are proving to me you don't care. Like I said you when you are around me to when you aren't are two totally different people. I don't even know what to think any more.\n\nI will take you by your actions not words from here on out\n\nGoodnight (her name)\n\nHer: I am working 16 hours straight to help support me and (littles name), if you can't see a good reason in that, then yeah this isn't going to work out.\n\nMe: I never would make plans with you and (littles name), and then pick up with out talking to you. Let alone this being the 5th time in row I make plans with you and you not showing up.\n\nThat's the difference, communication\n\nHer: (My name) I dont have a choice, I need the money and you are making me feel like the worst person in the world by doing my best to make my next car payment, attorney fee, whatever comes up next that Im barely scraping by to take care of.\n\nI understand this is a stressful time for her and I don\u2019t want to be insensitive, but it feels like I\u2019m in a one sided relationship. I\u2019ve been in relationships like that before and I don\u2019t want to be in another. I was single for 5 years before this because I\u2019m horrible at picking. I thought I picked well with her, but with all this court stuff going on she just seems so cold.\n\nI want to have a conversation with her this weekend and try to get to the bottom of this, but I need some advice on how to try and get across how she\u2019s acting towards me.\n\nThanks for the help.\n\nTL:DR Girlfriend keeps on flaking when I make plans with her, and she is cold when I confronted her on Monday. What should I do ",

She has a 9 month old baby and she is scared of her ex that she is engaged in a custody battle with. She is absolutely exhausted and the fact that you trying to get to bottom of this when it is totally obvious is flabbergasting to me.\n\nInstead of supporting her during this time, you are complaining that she isn't giving you enough. She has nothing left to give. You are making it all about you, and nothing about what you are doing to support her. You are complaining that she didn't take a day off to go watch Star Wars while she is fighting to making it through the day.  You are complaining that someone working 16 hour days isn't giving you sex.\n\nYou should break up with her, because you aren't really contributing to her life right now. You are extra stressor.

She's working probably more than full time, raising a child, is attempting to date, and is working with legal issues. \n\nWith the star wars example: For something like this, it may help to ask her what you can do to help her attend these things. Could reminding her to ask off work help? Would several reminders help? Is there something else you can take off her plate to help her focus on these social outings? Perhaps you could pick her up.\n\n>After this one I told her I was going to take a step back and not plan anything because every time I plan something she ends up backing out.\n\nThis gives me the impression you're not willing to be understanding or patient with her. I also get the impression from this that if she makes mistakes, you're going to disengage from the relationship. Will that make her more or less likely to want to pursue this relationship? Because I don't think she's doing it maliciously or intentionally. \n\n>She said she understood and would work on it.\n\nThis is not enough. You both need to have a very clear understanding about what you both want. You need concrete, clear actions and expectations. Because in the next section, you're upset with her for working a 16 hour shift. Your expectations are not matching. When you want her to \"work on it\" What does that mean, exactly, down to the tiniest detail? \n\nThis situation looks like this to me.\n\nYou want her to prioritize the relationship, forgoing long work shifts for it.\n\nShe wants to prioritize the relationship, but she also needs the money.\n\nBut you're not on the same page. \n\n>Are you just trying to make me break up with you? I just had a conversation with you about this, literally right before you went into work\n\nLikewise. What was the expectation you had? Were you clear about precisely what you want?\n\n>  \nI understand this is a stressful time for her and I don\u2019t want to be insensitive, but it feels like I\u2019m in a one sided relationship. I\u2019ve been in relationships like that before and I don\u2019t want to be in another. I was single for 5 years before this because I\u2019m horrible at picking. I thought I picked well with her, but with all this court stuff going on she just seems so cold.\n\nWhat does \"warm\" look like to you, in specific behaviors? Again, describe it by the tiniest actions and details. \"warm\" and \"cold\" are very broad and can easily encompass dozens of little behaviors, maybe hundreds. More smiles? More texts? Hugs? Gentle touching?\n\nIt may help to alter your expectations to match where her life is at. Maybe something changed for her in this past month. Life might have gone for her from \"dating\" mode to \"survival\" mode, but for you nothing has changed. Perhaps you and your son go to the movies, with the hope that she shows up, but not the expectation. Just something like \"I'm going out with my son. I understand you may be busy and would love to see you there. If you can make it, great. But I understand you may not come because you've forgotten to get time off before. I love you.\" And now when she doesn't show up, she's matching your expectation; if she does, she surpasses it.",

        "post-author": "anonymonsters",
        "text": "TL;DR - my partner of 5 years (27m) and I (26f) agreed on vacation dates for two separate trips. I got the days wrong on both requiring changing time off work and asking family to move their trip dates to accommodate. Meanwhile partner is all upset over the stress of it and it still not being perfectly the way we planned. Can\u2019t make everyone happy, but how can I forgive myself?\n\n\nThis just feels totally fucked and I need advice on how to forgive myself and move on here. Basically we planned two trips to the shore in June. Family has a house we can use. I thought we confirmed the dates but I guess I got it mixed up in my mind and missed a day for one and took off work for the entirely wrong week on the other, also missed a day on the weeklong one. So when my partner heard this he got extremely upset because these vacations are \u201call he\u2019s working for\u201d right now. Which is understandable. I said I would fix it. I work a job where it\u2019s difficult to get time off, so I had to go back to my employers and beg nicely to be off on an extra day where they really needed me. That worked out without too much trouble, but I still feel shitty making them rearrange their schedules for me.\n\nNext, our weeklong vacation (that I planned for the wrong week) ended up then overlapping with the only time my dad can get to the house in June. He planned his trip after I already claimed my dates though. Partner is upset about this because it doesn\u2019t feel like a vacation with a parent around. Okay fine. I ask my dad to change his departure time, which he does but not so that it fully avoids overlap. So now I feel like everyone is losing. I feel like a total POS. Dad probably feels like I hate him and don\u2019t want to see him but I just want to have my own time like we planned. Partner is still upset because the beginning of the vacation is tainted by another person being present. I likely cant switch to being off work to the correct week we originally planned on going to avoid overlap because of aforementioned difficulty for my employers being able to cover me. But I did ask to find out if it\u2019s possible, which makes me feel even worse because I already did this once with the other trip. \n\nI feel like such shit about all this I am afraid I won\u2019t even be able to enjoy the trips because of everything I had to fuck up to get there. I want to cry and stay home and never try to go anywhere or take off work ever again. Help. ",

But you shouldn't be telling yourself you are a POS (because you aren't) or thinking you need to give up vacations for forever.\n\nFirst, I think you need to give yourself a lot more grace. You are allowed to make mistakes. You have tried fixing this as much as you can. This is entirely forgivable. \n\nSecond, your dad's vacation is not your fault. Your dad planned a vacation to his house after you had asked and gotten the okay to use it.  Your partner can be frustrated at your dad, but not at you. Its not your house. You don't control your dad's actions.  You are responsible for zero of this. If partner wants a vacation that is 100% guaranteed to not have another person there, then he needs to pay for an accommodation not owned by your family. \n\nI really highly suggest finding a therapist to help you work through your anxiety and how much of the world you are trying to carry on your shoulders. My therapist has been a life saver.",

Also, your bf needs to be a little more reasonable- this type of thing can happen when you're staying at a family home.

Sometimes he says \u201cI need to have complete control over everything at all times or else I get upset.\u201d Through our relationship I never could see him as controlling, however being almost a year together i\u2019ve really started to learn that he tries to be very emotionally manipulative with getting me to do things. I recently had a colposcopy done (NOT A COLONOSCOPY). We had plans to go watch a movie, I didn\u2019t think about how I would feel after the procedure. I was taking my dog outside to use the bathroom (morning after procedure) I started feeling a lot of pain and muscle weakness. I went to my BF and said \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be able to go to the movies with you I just started feeling like sh*t from the procedure.\u201d He pulled his t shirt over his head and got mad. He was upset because he had already bought the tickets and said he couldn\u2019t get a refund. I apologized and said I will pay him the money back. Then, I went to take a hot shower to try and relieve some of the pain I was having. After the shower, I went in our room to get into comfy clothes. He comes in and says,  \u201cAre you almost ready? We have to be there in like 20min.\u201d  I said, \u201cI told you how I was feeling and I really don\u2019t think I can go to the movies right now.\u201d I suggested for him to go watch the movie so he would just lose the money for my ticket, as he wanted to see this movie as much as I did. He got very upset, left our room and I heard him punch something in the kitchen. I laid down and about 30min later he comes back in our room and says, \u201cI was able to get my money back.\u201d I said \u201cThat\u2019s great, I\u2019m sorry because I didn\u2019t expect to be in this much discomfort.\u201d He didn\u2019t say much so we brushed it off and  proceeded on with the day.

How can I put an end to him doing this to me? \n\n\nTL;DR \u2014\nI (23F) feel as if my BF (25M) of almost a year is very manipulative/controlling, emotionally with me.

        "text": "TL;DR: trying to reconcile a second time with my ex boyfriend. He doesnt know what he wants and wants to take it slow and actively refusing to make any future plans. I'm trying to figure out if he's stringing me along. No kissing or sex but lots of sentimental moments, consistent communication, and dates\n\nI (41F) dated my boyfriend (36M) for less than a year and we had planned to spend our lives together. He moved across the country to be closer to me and bought some property to build on. At a certain point he became very cold and distant because he began resenting me as he fixed up his property and I began detaching over his change of personality. We broke up and didnt speak for a couple of months and during this time he tried very hard to get in contact with me. Finally we tried to reconcile but I was angered by him reconnecting with his ex girlfriend while we were apart and their growing emotional connection as we were trying to patch things up. So we quickly ended things again. I thought about my anger and realized I was coming from a place of control and jealousy. He has been apologetic, and is now in therapy. We have forgiven each other. I love him and want to continue our path together. I contacted him three weeks later and he was at my door in an instant. We are being very cautious and he has explicitly stated that he hasn't made up his mind about what he wants, either to jump back in or move on. He has refused to kiss me or have sex because he wants to \"take it slow\", but we have been physically loving and close without hesitation. It's been two weeks since we've been back in contact and have been on several dates, expressed our love for each other, and made very near future plans. We have also mutually agreed to be exclusive. He keeps saying we need to stay in the present and refuses to plan anything too far in the future with me. Our communication is open and consistent. He has asked me to be patient with him while we navigate our relationship, but everything seems so vague and uncertain on his part. It's been wonderful taking things slow but I am missing the passionate aspect of our relationship- kissing and sex. He knows this and is very adamant that it is because he wants to let it \"happen organically\" Can anyone shed light on this? Is he stringing me along or is this typically of a guarded man dipping his toe back into a relationship with someone he describes as his \"favorite person\" whom he loves unconditionally.",

        "text": "Hi Reddit,\nMy boyfriend (28M) and I (24F) have been together for several years. Lately, I\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019ve completely lost interest in sex. It just doesn\u2019t feel exciting or fulfilling anymore, more like something I go along with, but don\u2019t actively desire.\n\nWhat\u2019s confusing is that I am still very attracted to him. I think he\u2019s really good-looking, and I love being close to him, kissing, cuddling, touching, just spending time together. There\u2019s still affection and emotional connection. I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve fallen out of love or anything.\n\nIt also isn\u2019t about wanting someone else, I don\u2019t feel turned on by anyone, and I don\u2019t fantasize about being with other people. It\u2019s not about boredom or missing excitement. It\u2019s more like the whole idea of sex just doesn\u2019t feel appealing to me anymore. I miss wanting it, but the desire just isn\u2019t there.\n\nI haven\u2019t talked to him about this in detail yet, because I don\u2019t want him to feel rejected or unattractive, which he isn\u2019t. But I\u2019m starting to feel confused and a bit worried. I don\u2019t want this to create distance between us, but I also don\u2019t know how to \u201cfix\u201d something I don\u2019t understand.\n\nHas anyone else gone through something similar? Is this just a phase, or something deeper? I\u2019d really appreciate hearing others' perspectives or advice.\n\nThanks in advance. \ud83d\udcac\n\nTL;DR:\nI (24F) love my boyfriend (28M) and still find him attractive, but I\u2019ve completely lost interest in sex, not just with him, but in general. I miss the desire and don\u2019t know how to get it back. Looking for advice from others who\u2019ve experienced this.",

        "text": " The start of our relationship was not easy, it took 5 months for us to be able to have sex because he was very shy at first and then he had to get surgery on his penis. That created some tension, but after those 5 months our relationship was heaven. I truly felt love, I felt energetic, safe, calm... It became the healthy relationship I've always dreamt of. We were a team, our days were filled with support, sweet thoughts and kisses. I've never been that happy. Unfortunately this lasted only for four months. As his mother got sick, he started being distant, which felt normal as first, after all his mother was sick and the only important thing was to take care of her. I made sure I was being helpful, I still cook healthy meals for his mother, I text her frequently, researched doctors and the best exercises to keep her moving. However, she is a piece of work ( very controlling, jealous of me, very possessive) and I did vent about her to my Fianc\u00e9... She would criticise my cooking, constantly telling me what to do. She told her ADULT son he couldn't go on a trip with me because he had to work. Worst thing that happened is that I left my suitcase at her house (my fianc\u00e9 was still living with her) and she went through my clothes and washed some of them. That felt like a violation of my privacy, so I asked my Fianc\u00e9 to move in together, after all he had already proposed to me because things were just amazing. I assume that this \"request\" and the occasional venting convinced him that his mother and I were antagonists and that he had to choose between us. So he started defending his mother aggressively, for example he shouted at me when I asked if he could tell his mother not to call more than once when we are on holidays together. But we were still looking for apartments, he feel in love with this one apartment and convinced me to rent it with him. So we did. After that he started telling me I forced him to move in together, that he feels suffocated and can never see his friends (I have never once told him not to see his friends). He eventually realised that I never forced him to do anything, but he stopped being thoughtful and kind, stopped touching me and making plans with me. he acts like he does not care, sometimes he does not even look at me. It hurts like hell because I felt in bones like he was the one for me and he is not the same man anymore. I am still supporting him, I am never leaving his side, I take good care of him and his mother by giving them all the love I have. Please, I you found yourself in similar situation, I need your advice. I feel like I lost him and I am loosing myself as well.\n\n  \nTLDR: My Fianc\u00e9 (M27) has been distant for about 3 months now. We have been together for a year now. His Mother (F59) was diagnosed with cancer 8 months ago. ",

You do you, but that sounds like a REALLY bad idea.\n\nI think it's OK to keep dating him for a bit, if you truly think it's just the emotional upset of dealing with his mother's serious illness that's caused him to become far less affectionate and increasingly irritated with you.  But it's also possible that your relationship was never built to go the distance.  Long-term relationships depend on increasing intimacy - the emotional kind, not the physical kind.  That deepening emotional connection bridges the gap and eventually replaces the feel-good hormonal surge of a Shiny New Love.  Those endorphins tend to wear off after the first year or so - the so-called honeymoon period, and you're right on schedule for it to end.   It's quite possible that your BF's feelings were primarily based in physical attraction and infatuation, rather than a deep and long-lasting love based on shared interests and values.\n\nThe semi-good news?  You may have discovered his true personality BEFORE you married him, while you still have time to change your mind!\n\nWith modern medical advances, his mother could live on with a chronic cancer condition for decades.  If this is a far cry from the adult life you had planned for yourself, and your BF can't manage to find his way back to treating you with love and respect, no one would blame you if you decided to break off the engagement, end the relationship, and move on.  This is the only life you're ever going to get, OP.  It sounds like you're making major personal sacrifices, and giving a whole lot more love than you're receiving from your partner.",

I don\u2019t feel ready to tell friends or family, so I\u2019m hoping someone here might understand.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for almost three years. We live together. A few weeks ago, I found signs he had downloaded things from porn websites. I asked him about it, and he insisted they were from before we met. He told me he hadn\u2019t watched porn in years. This mattered to me, because of my own personal insecurities and history, which I\u2019ve always been honest about.\n\nI asked him multiple times, directly, emotionally, if he ever felt the need to do things alone, if he missed something. Every time, he said no. And that he only wants to do it with me, that I'm enough and the only one he's attracted to. But a few weeks ago, he admitted he had been watching porn and masturbating in secret for months.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the porn. It\u2019s the lying and hiding when he knew it would hurt me. He watched me suffer, doubt myself, cry\u2026 and kept saying exactly what I wanted to hear. Now, he says he\u2019s done with it, gave me access to his phone, and wants to rebuild. He says he didn't know how much it would hurt me, but he thinks he understands now how much it hurt me.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know how to feel close to him anymore. I want to. I miss feeling connected. I still love him.  \nBut I keep replaying everything. I don\u2019t feel safe, and I\u2019m so tired of constantly questioning whether I\u2019m enough. To make it even worse for me, he can climax to porn, but not with me. He says it\u2019s stress or medication, but it hurts more than I can say.\n\nHow do you begin to trust someone again when you still love them, but they deeply hurt you? How do you feel close to someone when your whole body feels like it\u2019s still flinching from betrayal? I don\u2019t want to walk away, but I don\u2019t want to lose myself either.\n\n  \n**TL;DR -** My boyfriend lied to me for months about secretly watching porn, even though he knew how much it would hurt me. He recently admitted it and wants to rebuild trust. I still love him and want to stay, but I feel heartbroken, anxious, and disconnected. How do I feel safe and close again after betrayal?",

I have never been in a relationship before this, only having my first kiss at 21 with someone (20M) who, (not so) deep down, I knew would end up hurting me. I now know that what I was experiencing was feeling wanted for the very first time, that maybe someone really COULD be interested in me. But I didn\u2019t feel fireworks, and it didn\u2019t feel like falling in love with him would be this inevitable thing. It felt awkward, forced almost. Any other experience I had before then was at most 7 or 8 different first dates organized via dreaded dating apps. All of these first date connections were ended by me. \n\nAnd then after my first and only situationship ended, I met them (22NB). The light of my life, someone that I never would have met if not for some completely unrelated, coincidental, shared glances.  \n\nAnd wow. Fireworks. The best, most beautiful, wonderful fireworks I\u2019ve ever seen. But also the scariest. It\u2019s a slightly terrifying feeling, like my life will never be the same again; like my life will permanently be entwined with theirs, but in the best way possible. \n\nThough I think what makes it a bit scarier is that I am aware of my na\u00efvet\u00e9 due to my lack of experience. But each and every time I step back and think further on it I\u2019m met with the same overwhelming, ever so sure feeling that I am going to fall in love with them; that I want to be theirs, and them to be mine. \n\nEverything feels so secure, so right, so safe. It really is very easy to be there for them, to do better for them, to communicate with them. And it\u2019s even easier to want to do all of those things. \n\nTL;DR: I have little to no experience with dating, and have never been in a relationship before this.

We were living on our own but I lost my job last year and my husband is disabled with no income at all. We didn\u2019t have anywhere to go so we moved in with my parents, plus I\u2019m going to start school soon to advance my career and my parents are assisting me with that.\n\nThe conflict is my dad (me and him do not have a good relationship), he can be really selfish and has no empathy. My husband puts up with him for the most part but my dad keeps throwing our stuff away without checking with us first and it makes my husband really angry and we have asked my dad to stop but he continues anyway.\n\nMy husband was venting to me about it in our room and my mom overheard the conversation and confronted us.

OP and her husband are poor, they can't even afford basic living expenses, so throwing away the few remaining things they own just makes their situation worse and is also a violation of the few remaining property rights they have. This is why homeless people are so attached to their meagre possessions, because it's all they have.

How guests are treated has a direct impact on whether staying in a particular home is sustainable \u2014 emotionally, mentally, and logistically. If the hosts are repeatedly throwing away personal belongings without consent, eavesdropping on private conversations, and escalating those into screaming matches, that\u2019s more than just 'friction.' That\u2019s a hostile environment, and OP and hubbie need to seriously consider if it's realistic to assume they will be able to white knuckle staying there for 3 whole years.\n\n>If they don't like how they're being treated then they need to focus on getting on their feet, not litigating over who started some inane conflict, or even less important over whose \"rights\" are being violated.\n\nFirstly, no-one is 'litigating'. Not the OP (who is asking for assistance and has taken more blame on herself than I believe she should), and not me. I do have an issue with you passing moral judgement on the husband for getting into a screaming match, when he was attempting to not get into a screaming match by venting to his wife behind closed doors about his painting being cut into pieces.\n\nSecondly, rights and boundaries aren\u2019t \u201cinane.\u201d Being poor doesn\u2019t mean you stop deserving basic respect or privacy. The husband didn\u2019t instigate the screaming match. He vented privately to his wife after discovering that FIL had destroyed his painting. That\u2019s not an overreaction. That\u2019s an understandable reaction to of grief and helplessness and having one of your few possessions destroyed.\n\nAnd guess what? While he was venting he was being monitored, and his words were used to force a confrontation. It's almost like the parents are trying to provoke a reaction, and I would not be surprised if they were doing so in an attempt to expel OP's husband from the house in a way that they don't appear to be the bad guys.\n\n>It 100% is about pride, maybe not for OP who seems more reasonable, but absolutely for her husband. If he'd rather live in his truck than keep his mouth shut for a free room, so be it.\n\nSaying this is about pride is awfully reductive. We aren't talking about a man refusing assistance out of ego, We are talking about someone who is frustrated that they are dependent on someone for help who is using that help to violate their basic dignity. \n\nGetting upset when your last few belongings are destroyed isn\u2019t pride. Feeling emotionally raw after being monitored and confronted isn\u2019t pride. Wanting to leave a residence, even if it means living in a truck, implies that the living situation is too toxic. That's not a prideful tantrum, that's a move to preserve one's sanity.",

        "text": "Having trouble with my wife.\n\nMy wife (f 28) and myself (30ftm) seem to literally have no intimate relationship. We've been together since 2020 and married since 2022 (5 years together 3 married) Yeah we hug and kiss and stuff. I love her very dearly. Last February she discovered some online profiles i had for dirty chatting with other people (I used that for maybe 3 months) At that point we hadn't been intimate for over 2 years. I gave her plenty of warning where I was with that before i got an email from one of my old profiles and re-activated it. We've since made a lot of head way. But damn if I still feel like my needs aren't being met. We still haven't had intimacy. Ive become more understanding of her feelings and I feel like I'm giving her what she needs in the relationship emotionally. Much of which I maybe didn't before. \n\nI carry my weight at home. I do all the cooking. I do the laundry. Walk and feed the dogs. I do the cat litter box. I build her nice things like garden boxes. I compliment her and snuggle. So it's not like I'm an additional responsibility she has to take care of. I just don't know what else to do here. I'm at a loss. I refuse to go another couple years without intimacy. It gives me some serious self esteem issues considering my body dysphoria to begin with and it's so hard for me to remain emotionally connected to someone im not physical with. \n\nIll add that im autistic and she is unmedicated ADHD.\n\nI feel like I'm doing everything I can but still get rejected whenever I even try. Any advice is appreciete.\n\nTL;DR: been with my partner for 5 years and our bedroom life is dead. Help. What else can I try?",

You could have continued to have conversations with her about the lack of intimacy until a solution was reached, or until a decision to end the relationship was met, but you didn\u2019t. Instead you signed up for whatever dating app and cheated on her. And now she has to live knowing that her husband cared more about getting his rocks off than actively and consistently working with his wife, the one he vowed to commit to, to find a solution. I do believe it could have been fixed before, but now irreparable damage has been done. She doesn\u2019t owe you her sexual intimacy when you couldn\u2019t even provide her with the emotional intimacy she needed. She shouldn\u2019t have needed to be hurt for you to realize that you weren\u2019t providing her with what she needed. Is it that really that you love and care about her or that you just don\u2019t want to be alone? My answer is that loving and caring for someone takes a lot more than what was done here. Those who love someone do everything in their power to address and fix things, or end it if there isn\u2019t a solution. They don\u2019t cheat.",

You'll never hear me say I didn't. I wasn't the only person with drawing on that front.\n\nI should have been more clear; when I said maybe I didn't fully before. I meant that she is a very very HIGHLY  emotional person. Being autistic I can't always relate. I am very analytical and spent more time trying to fix her problems rather then just listen. Since doing counseling we've gotten much better strategies on the front. She's also agreed to therapy on her own as there's always been contention between us based on her refusal to go and obtain better coping strategies.\n\nThere's been a lot for us. We've had a close death in the family. I have a child with an ex that isn't always great to deal with. We both have traumas as well. \n\nRelationships aren't always so black and white. Neither is cheating. I'm not proud of what I've done. I've accepted it and made choices and I've been in therapy for the 6th time in my life since January.",

        "post-author": "chael809",
        "text": "My wife and mother have always had a rocky relationship, but have always been able to manage, my wife in particular feels that my mom has talked about her behind her back and my mom supposedly doesn\u2019t know what she did to get the cold shoulder from my wife. \n\nLast episode was About 3-4 months ago we were going out and we needed someone to stay with the kids (14m, 12f, 2m) and I suggested we should leave them with my mom, that way she gets to hangout with them, since she doesn\u2019t really spend much time with them. My wife tried to counter that and try to make it so that they would stay with her parents, but I stood my ground and they were gonna stay with my mom. The day came and I drop them off early at my moms house, so we could get ready, and as we are almost leaving she tells me she doesn\u2019t feel ok living the youngest one with my mom because she won\u2019t know how to take care of him, and I said that it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal, anyways she calls my mom to talk to her about this and basically ends up saying she\u2019s going to pick them up and basically hangs up on her abruptly, I got pretty much pissed at that, but decided to play it cool cuz I didn\u2019t want to mess up the day, we picked up the kids and my mother definitely felt disrespected by her for hanging up the phone in such a manner (but because I walked in and got the kids we didn\u2019t really get to discuss it.\n\nAfter that they weren\u2019t speaking much to the point where my mom ended up blocking her on WhatsApp, and my wife found out that she was blocked, and then also found out that my daughter was blocked (my daughter being blocked is kinda not clear on how that happened). And basically I had to hear it again about how my mother was a nightmare and how she hated us and just a bunch of demeaning things about my mother, and I tried to stay neutral and said that it was a reaction based on what had happened ( I didn\u2019t know a 100% but I kinda figured) and that we should all have a conversation about it and get down to the bottom of the issue between her and my mother, because I didn\u2019t want to feel like my mother wouldn\u2019t be accept in my house if she wanted to come over or whatever.\n\nFast forward to Memorial Day weekend, one of my aunts was in town and since I had just bought my house a couple of months ago I wanted her to come see it, and she was staying at my moms house, so I ended up inviting my mother over also, my wife knew about it because I communicated to her that I wanted to bring them over, and she was fine with it. My mother on the other hand was a bit skeptical about coming over but at the end decided to come.\n\nMy wife was cool with it and even went and bought some crackers and cheese to serve and some coffee. We get there and walk in and everything seemed to be cordial, but I could tell my wife was not too comfortable with this visit not from my aunt but from my mother, she seem hesitant and didn\u2019t want to sit with us and was a little tense, some time goes by I\u2019m showing my aunt the house and we go back to the living room and my wife is kinda just floating around and not really sitting or interacting, just kinda awkward, by then I had noticed my daughter had not said hi to my mom or aunt so I go to her room and asked her to come and say hi to them, she basically refused and then my wife came over and in front of everyone basically asked me what was wrong and that she felt like the mood was tense, that if there was something going on I should tell her, kinda in a way so others can hear, and I basically said that no one was saying anything and that if she had a problem she could just say it, and she said that maybe my mother had a problem and so then I asked my mother in front of everyone if she had a problem and my mother replied that she didn\u2019t and that moment was settled.\n\nWell after a little while my wife was sitting next to me and my mother was sitting across, and so there was silence and I felt like I had to try and get them talking about the issue without picking sides just talk it out to start from scratch, and when I did that, and I started pointing out some of the things that they have both done to make the issue bigger then all hell broke loose and they started arguing with each other, it got pretty intense, my mother mentioned her hanging up the phone and my wife mentioned something to the effect of her being deceiving, and basically it was a mess, nothing came of it, they disrespected each other some more, I tried to mediate but it didn\u2019t work, by the end I took my mother home, and it hurt me to see the 2 of the most important women in my life not get along with each other, so now I\u2019m just here thinking of if I should even stay with my wife (not running to my mothers arms because I know she has as much fault and I\u2019m a grown man) or walk away just cuz I can\u2019t stand the idea of not being able to have my kids see their grandmother or have her over when we have get togethers, maybe I\u2019m just thinking about it too much, maybe I should just look forward to a live where my mother has very limited access to my kids.\n\nTl;dr: my wife and mother got into a heated argument over Memorial Day weekend over the way they treat each other, I tried to meditate but it didn\u2019t work, im contemplating braking it off with my wife because I feel she is being way too condescending against my mother, but I also know my mother has some fault in this too, and now I\u2019m contemplating weather if I should move out altogether and start from scratch. \n\n\n\n",

Your alternatives of: leaving your wife, walking away, distancing yourself from your mom, moving out, starting from scratch all sound like you running away from the conflict rather than resolving it in a productive manner. All of those (besides distancing from your mom) would rock your kids' world to the extent that I'm surprised you're not worried about how your choice affects them. They're watching you right now, and judging your character accordingly. \n\nAt the end of the day, being married means when there's a choice between wife vs. mom, you pick wife.

They have specific needs, likes, dislikes, parents have certain ways they want things done, etc. I'm assuming your wife had reason to believe your mother would not be providing care to the standard she wanted.

My wife tried to counter that and try to make it so that they would stay with her parents, but I stood my ground and they were gonna stay with my mom.\n\nIt seems like your wife has some concerns about your mother's ability to look after your kids (specifically the youngest one) in a way that she is comfortable with. Instead of finding a way to ease your wife's concerns (for example, by calling your mother to set boundaries and make sure your instructions are followed), you just put your foot down and insisted they go stay with your mom, end of discussion.\n\nThen, you go to drop the kid off and your wife makes it explicit that she is doubting your mom's ability to look after the youngest one properly. Instead of stepping up and making sure your mother has the instructions down, you dismiss the concern and plow ahead. Then your wife has to be the one to call and have this conversation with your mom that you should be having. During that conversation she feels like your mom is brushing her off or being dismissive - guessing it's not the first time that has happened - and decides fuck it, I don't trust this woman to watch my toddler, I'm not risking it. Yes, hanging up the phone abruptly is a little rude, but I think the conversation that led your wife to deciding she doesn't trust your mom to watch your toddler was not the most constructive from your mom's side either. Also, hanging up the phone with the intention to go directly to that person's house is not the same thing as hanging up and ignoring them.\n\nIn your post you don't make any mention of what your wife's specific concerns are, and whether your mom's inability to follow instructions for the kids has been an issue before now - but it seems like it has. Did you seek understanding for yourself of why your wife was uncomfortable with all this? Are her concerns valid? I know if my partner didn't trust somebody to look after the kids, then I wouldn't be taking that lightly.\n\nIt seems like at no point after this did you have a conversation with your mom where you presented a united front with your wife and said, \"This is why we didn't feel comfortable leaving the kids with you and this is what needs to change moving forward.\" It seems like you primarily took your mother's side in this conflict because your wife abruptly ended a phone call that was going poorly, and continued to take your mother's side even when she blocked your wife and your pre-teen daughter on WhatsApp. Who blocks their pre-teen grandchild? Doesn't that raise a red flag to you?\n\n>And basically I had to hear it again about how my mother was a nightmare and how she hated us and just a bunch of demeaning things about my mother, and I tried to stay neutral and said that it was a reaction based on what had happened ( I didn\u2019t know a 100% but I kinda figured)\n\nAt this point, I think your wife has every right in the world to be shit-talking your mom, and the fact that you try to minimize her issues and stay out of it is a very big part of the problem. At no point do you ever seem to acknowledge that your mom needs to make some changes or has any fault. You just want your wife to get over it. If I was married to you I would be absolutely pissed. You should be having conversations with your mom (*you*, not your wife) where you present the problems that you and your wife agree on as *your own problem* (not your wife's) to your mom and set expectations moving forward.\n\nThen, instead of having those conversations, you invite your mom as a tag-along to your aunt's visit. You've got this high level of tension in the air, and you have company at the same time (your aunt), and it makes it REALLY awkward to discuss any sort of issue. And instead of you taking the reins and expressing (again, as a united front with your wife) the problems that have been going on, you pass the buck to her and make her be the one to broach the subject. Obviously your wife doesn't want to bring up these issues in front of your aunt, and neither does your mom. But still, you force the conversation and try to bring up all the things that both of them have done to exacerbate the issue without ever really getting to the heart of it.\n\nTo be real, I think you are scared to stand up to your mom about anything and so over the years you have left your wife to have all the conversations that involve setting boundaries with her, and have probably thrown her under the bus a number of times similar to how you did in this post. Those conversations that your wife is having to set standards of childcare and whatnot should be funnelled through *you* not your wife, because you are the one who has the closer relationship with your mom, and your relationship can withstand it more. As a result of your wife having to the one to bring these things up and you seemingly never presenting a united front with your wife (always trying to \"stay neutral\"), there has been a buildup of tension and resentment by your mother towards your wife - and probably also a buildup of resentment by your wife toward you. I think you should seek out couple's counselling and go into it open to the idea that you are handling things really really poorly, and you need to completely overhaul the dynamics that you have with your mother, especially as it relates to your wife/family.",

        "post-author": "Turbulent-Egg-4942",
        "text": "***TW:\u00a0Mentions of eating disorders***\n\n*tl;dr: feeling like I'm outgrowing my partner of five years, who hasn't done anything wrong; needing advice or perspective!*\n\nHi everyone, I\u2019m really struggling and could use some advice. I want to start by saying my partner (37M) is a kind, supportive, and wonderful person, and I (29F) love him like family. But I\u2019m starting to question if that\u2019s all there is to being in a relationship, and I\u2019m terrified about it. I want to emphasise that he hasn\u2019t done anything\u00a0*wrong*, but something feels off, and I\u2019m hoping for clarity.\n\nWe\u2019ve been together for five years, but we met at work when I was 22. We got together at the start of the pandemic, and with strict COVID restrictions where I live, we got used to seeing each other just once a week, so the years kind of blurred together.\u00a0\n\nDuring that time, I developed a severe eating disorder and became a shell of a human being, so the next two years from 2022 - 2024 felt like another blur. He was incredibly supportive through my recovery, and I\u2019ll always be grateful for that, which is why I feel so incredibly guilty for how I\u2019ve been feeling.\n\nHere are the things that are nagging at me:\n\n**1. Physical intimacy**: Somewhere around the 3 year mark, I stopped wanting physical contact. This coincided with my eating disorder (which can cause that) so I brushed it off. But even after full recovery, any sort of prolonged touch makes me uncomfortable. I started to wonder whether I might just be fully asexual, but going out and talking to people made me realize I\u00a0*can*\u00a0feel attraction\u2026it\u2019s just not happening with him. I want to stress that I have not met anyone else; it\u2019s more that these interactions made me feel\u00a0*interesting*\u00a0again, something I haven\u2019t felt in a while. I fully understand that this is normal in long-term relationships, but I can't help but wonder what it's like to be physically attracted to someone.\n\n**2. Feeling disconnected**: He\u2019s so kind and supportive, but every conversation either feels really shallow or one-sided. We have banter and it\u2019s\u00a0*fun,*\u00a0but when we talk about anything serious I feel like I\u2019m talking\u00a0*at*\u00a0him, not\u00a0*with*\u00a0him. This is also the reason why we don\u2019t fight - he rarely contributes to the conversation. and when I repeat something later, it\u2019s always like he\u2019s hearing it for the first time, which makes me feel unheard. If I ask him to express his thoughts he will literally just tell me he has none, which brings me to the next point.\n\n**3. How passive he is**: The biggest issue came when he quit his job after years of resenting it. I\u2019m proud of him for choosing happiness, but he has never once spoken up about the unfair workloads. Not once. He just let the resentment build up and took it all in until he couldn\u2019t anymore. This is a pattern: he will get upset but won\u2019t voice his feelings or act, even after I\u2019ve asked/encouraged/begged him to. It feels like he\u2019s stuck in a cycle he won\u2019t break, and I worry it\u2019ll continue in a new job.\n\nThis is something that extends outside of work. Once, a stranger shoved me hard, and he did nothing. He didn\u2019t say a word. And when I wanted to address it, he held me back. I understand wanting to avoid confrontation/trouble, but it really bothered me that he made it seem like a me problem.\n\nAnother time, someone took our paid seats at the theatre, and he suggested we just sit elsewhere. I handled it and got the seats back, but it was frustrating. I\u2019m fully capable of standing up for myself, but I want a partner I know I can rely on to step up too, if that makes sense.\n\nWhen I think about the future, I panic that I can\u2019t count on him to make decisions or advocate for me, or us as a unit. This makes me feel so guilty because he\u2019s technically done nothing \u201cwrong,\u201d and I love him like family. He\u2019s still the same kind and thoughtful person, and seeing him feels like being at home. But I\u2019m scared I\u2019m outgrowing him, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nHas anyone felt this way? How did you navigate it? I\u2019d appreciate any advice or perspective. Thank you!",

I think in my situation Ive stayed because we are married and share everything and it would be so so so difficult to leave. I think if you\u2019re able to leave him, do it before it\u2019s too late. Also, can you imagine dating a 22 yo now, being the age he was when you got together? And the fact that you have to be the more mature one when he is much older is crazy. Lack of emotional intelligence is real and even though he\u2019s not \u201cdoing anything wrong\u201d he\u2019s also not doing the right thing, which would be to go to therapy to help open himself up to confrontation. As for physical attraction, assess what about him has changed to make you less attracted than before. Encourage ways for him to improve his appearance.",

He\u2019s incredibly sweet and caring in his own way, and he would move mountains for me - I just think that he doesn\u2019t have the capacity to understand. He\u2019s always been relatively mellow and isn\u2019t the most emotionally aware.\n\nRegarding attraction - I\u2019ve always thought he was cute, but there was a period of time when I was genuinely physically attracted to him. That faded when my eating disorder developed, but I always thought it would return upon recovery.. but it hasn\u2019t. I look at him fondly, but in the way you would a family member. \n\nWe\u2019ve had conversations about it - he\u2019s adamant that he\u2019s not with me for intimacy and that support me and that we\u2019d figure it out either way, but I don\u2019t feel right putting him in a position where his partner can\u2019t desire him physically.",

Moreover, I think that concerns 2 and 3 actually contribute to you not wanting intimacy.\n\n\nI also feel that the dynamic you've described is more of a caregiver/dependant than of equal partners. You carry twice the mental load, you don't connect on a deeper level (how can you if he literally \"has no thoughts\"?), you can't count on him even for such mundane things as someone taking your seats.\u00a0\n\n\nProbably, you would like him to change. To realize that he has a lot to work on and actually do the work. However, this is not going to happen. Firstly, such change require a ton of work. Therapy is hard work changing the patterns in the brain and he hasn't as much as acknowledged his problems. Secondly, he faces no consequences for his actions/inactions. You stayed with him, didn't you? You still agree to provide emotional and mental labor to accommodate him. So chances of him changing a practically null. Aren't you afraid to spend all your life like this, unheard, unnoticed, undesired, carrying the double load?..\n\n\nYou're very right to panic but you're not panicking enough. He will never advocate for you or take the responsibility. Never.\n\n\nAs for him having done nothing wrong... Here is the list of what he did do wrong:\n- he refuses to make effort to connect to you\n- he doesn't want to engage in meaningful conversation with you\n- he is content with you carrying the double emotional and mental load\n- he chooses not to face his emotions knowing it negatively affects you\n- he chooses not to improve his communication skills\n- he refuses to acknowledge his shortcomings\u00a0\n- he makes no effort to build intimacy\n- he refused to protect you\n- he is emotionally manipulative (especially with guilt).\n\n\nYou know, sometimes one can describe their partner as \"laying in a starfish position\" during sex. This dude is laying in a starfish position in your relationship as a whole.",

        "text": "Hi I am 14y female and my 'friend' is a 14y female aswell, and my bestie also just happens to be a 14y female aswell. I've only really known my 'friend' for 4 weeks but i've been besties with my bestie for 2 years.\n\nSo basically me and my bestie wanted to enter a commerce competition together which has a prize of $1000. Me and her work REALLY WELL together and have gotten outstanding results in the past. I asked her if she wanted to do it and she agreed!!!!!!\n\nNow moving on to my 'friend' let's call her Ari. First of all Ari's personality is so bad and she has a superiority complex so no one ever wants to partner or group with her in group projects. Secondly she is known for trying to push her way into making groups of 3 when the teacher says make partners by crying, after she does this she doesnt do any work and makes the group fail. q\n\nNow when the teacher announced the competition i immediatly texted my bestie asking to pair when Ari walks over and asks who i'm working with, I saw i'm working with my bestie and she says \"Let's make a group of 3\" and i reply with \"me and my bestie just really want to work together on this one\" she says \"NO NO NO it's ok we will be great together\" then she texts my bestie if she can join my group. I then tell her that i really dont want her in my group and she gets super mad and decides to start trash talking me to a friend who's she bullied in a previous group task. This friend is friends with me and doesnt like Ari so it's ok. On the train my crush waves at me and i wave back from across the carrige. i move closer to him and sit next to Ari she looks mad and we just sit in silence. \n\nSHE'S STILL TRYING TO JOIN ME AND MY BESTIE PLS HELPPPPPP\n\nTL:DR\n\n",

Continue being friendly with Ari, but enforce your boundaries. It's likely Ari will probably just be pissed at you and won't be your friend. With how you've described her that's probably... fine. Give her a wide berth and move on with your life.",

        "post-author": "Intelligent-Award839",
        "text": " I m31 girlfriend f37 6 months together \n\nSo I am going to try and word it as good and especially as neutral as I can in order to have a outsider their view view that is unbiased on the situation.\n\nI have been in a relationship for 6 months now.\nI met this girl online, was so insanely attracted to her that I couldn't resist striking up conversation.\n\nI ended up following her from one online platform to a other, than we exchanged numbers and a month and half later we met up.\nThis girl is a extremely unique one of a kind woman.\n\nShe's has been in a institution for people with mental health problems and addiction, she's been in and out these institutions for about half her life.\nShe's also been in mental hospitals and therapy for almost her entire life too.\n\nThe reason?\nShe was heavily abused, sexually, pscycally, emotionally from childhood on.\nBy her mother no less.\nAs a survival mechanism she developed psychopathic, sociopathic, and narcissistic tendencies.\n\nShe has after leaving the environment of her abuser(mother)\nDevelopt a nasty habit of manipulating everyone around her to get her way, or out of a sadistic trait to hurt people.\n\nThis behavior has led her to destroy the 2 men she had a serious relationship with and who were genuinely in love with her and did nothing but their best to see her happy.\nShe also ended up with a alcohol addiction that nearly ended up killing her.\n\nThe past 5 years of her life she decided to go for a different approach.\nShe no longer hid the fact that she didn't feel empathy or any remorse, and she stopped manipulating the people close to her because this behavior lead to her being so lonely in the end, she almost threw herself in front of a train.\n\nIn fact she did, but people saw and cops were involved to get her of the rails before she was successful.\nThe other institute what she called home before the one she lives now.\nWas hell, no other way to describe it.\nOnly money was on the minds of the people who were in charge there.\n\nFor over 1,5 years she decided that she finally wanted to explore her sexuality, and not just play the part in a relationship, or be forced by anyone.\nThis is the reason why I met her on pornhub and not a more normal social media platform.\n\nShe said to me, even before meeting up with me.\nThat I would be the first guy in her life she wanted to have sex with, she even was looking forward to this from before we met.\nAnd this is true, how much effort it took for her to get comfortable enough with me to go for it tells me she was 100% honest about this.\n\nBecause of her unique situation she has the right to a extremely early pension, but because of her age and lack of work years.\nThis money is only 500\u20ac per month.\nEver since I first met up with her, we've had one BIG issue in our relationship.\n\nThat being how much we saw each other per month.\nShe was only able to do so because of her mental health (her institution allows her to go out and stay the weekend every week) twice per month.\nI have always been very vocal about me wanting to see her weekly, after much arguing and fighting I finally gave in to her pace of 2 times per month, but she did promise me that when we reached half a year of relationship that every week would become a thing.\n\nHalf a year of relationship is where we are at now, and I am seeing her less and less than ever before.\n\nSeeing how little money she has, and how much I wanted her to be happy.\nI got her things of her Amazon wishlist, for around a good 100\u20ac per month.\nI knew that I was getting her stuff she could have never dreamed of having without my help.\nAnd i very much love making her happy.\nI even got her a playstation 5 not that long ago, as well as paying some bills so that she was finally debt free for the first time in years\n\nMy living conditions are not super comfortable for a woman, my toilet is broken and showering at my house is impossible, and in winter I have to use electric heaters to warm up.\nBut I have always taken her to a nearby gas station for using the toilet.\nAnd showering is possible at my aunt's place who lives a few hundred meters away.\nShe even said that I did so much for her to feel at ease in my room that this was very doable for her, she always refuses to shower at my aunt because she doesn't really like being there. Even if I can make it so we don't spend any minute longer than we need there.\n\nOver the course of these 6 months, I have taken us to hotels near the border( she lives in Germany, I live Belgium)\nI'm actively looking for a new place on my own ( this is something that I wanted to do before meeting her, but I have been putting in effort for speeding this up because I want to have a life together with her)\n\nLast time I saw her was 2 weeks ago, this weekend was one of the only ones we've had that was really bad.\nEversince I have been begging her to finally meet up with me weekly, I completely dropped this for months.\n\nFor me having the stability and security of seeing the woman i love weekly is extremely important to me.\nShe only ever argues with me about the fact that I did get mad a few times because of her ignoring this one thing I asked of her.\nShe keeps telling me that one day she will come over weekly.\n\nI have gotten into contact with professional mental health practicers because I was doing bad(still far from perfect)\nI did this for a huge part because of her asking me.\nI'm speeding up moving out on my own also for her, and our future together.\nI have made several appointments with different medical people because she asked this from me.\n\nI have by now spend a fortune on her, I mean every time we see it's all on my paycheck she doesn't have any money.\nThe hotels, the food, even me getting her one or two packages of tobacco for when she goes back home to get her through the rest of the month.\nThe amounts of things I bought her from Amazon is insane, the playstation 5 is the most expensive one, but certainly far from all I got her.\n\nI never expected anything in return, I just wanted her to be happy.\nAt this point in time, I really need for her to provide me with the security of her being here for me in the weekend.\nI know my situation is not super fun, but I am changing this, especially fast for her!\n\nShe used her extensive knowledge of psychology to help me out with personal insecurities and I will forever be thankful for that.\n\nBut the last 6 weeks I saw her twice, this is even so much less than what was agreed in the start.\nThe two times we saw each other in the past 6 weeks I had one specific request.\nI was having a very high libido and asked her to make those weekends be more focused on sex, I obviously want so much more from her, I love her!\n\nBut I asked because this was never a problem before, the 2 times we saw each other I got almost nothing from her despite me asking this clearly and her being up for a weekend like this in the past.\n\nNot only am I getting to see her less and less, sometimes when we had agreed to see a few weeks in a row, something last minute came up on Friday while I was already super excited and had prepared everything I could to have a great time together.\nShe fell off the map until Sunday evening coming back with a explanation that was super vague and made no sense.\n\nThe past few days especially I have been pouring my heart and soul into trying to communicate with her.\nHer replies are always something like that she didn't even knew that I was struggling so much because of the lack of security of seeing her, her explaining that she too needed to work on our relationship, but so do I, and If I work on certain things about myself it would great because I could suddenly deal better with her not coming my way on the things that I want from her.\nAnd some other of her answers are, yes I understand you, but I am not going to even make a compromise for you.\n\nThe past 2 days I have been writing entire novels and leaving very long voice messages about how much she means to me and how much I need for her to be here in the weekend.\nToday she even kinda made a joke about my points.\n\nYesterday she said she was not responsible for me feeling lonely in the weekends she isn't with me.\nI disagree with this, I don't think a partner should be responsible for your happiness because too many factors involved, but loneliness is something that I expect a partner to help with.\n\nShe keeps going on and on about the times I got angry with her ignoring my requests and still gives me nothing to count on things being different in the future.\n\nShe told me about how she destroyed good guys in her past, she said she is different now.\n\nI'm at the end of what I am able to do for her.\nHer situation is so much of a hassle that most guys would not even bother for just sex.\n\nI'm doing all I can to offer her a normal life outside of mental institutions again.\nI'm completely drained of energy and ideas for what I can still do.\nI'm so at the end of what I can that I am about to fall into very deep mental issues myself.\n\nI didn't only help her with money and gifts, I didn't only spent so much time energy and effort into making her feel special and beautiful (she has major self-image issues)\nI didn't only help her get a chance at having a normal sexlife.\nI did ALL of this and more without even blinking a eye.\n\nI only ask for her to finally see me in the weekends, I don't mind if her institution is going to a basketball game, or they're throwing a birthday party for a other resident and her therefore not seeing me.\n\nI feel hurt when she calls of a weekend with me to spend the entire time playing games on her phone that are aimed at childeren, she calls this self-care.\nThese games she plays when we are together too, and I don't mind this.\n\nBut she rather does that, mixes in texting and sexting with me, and tells me how much she would have rather be with me then alone in her room!!\n\nI am burning out because of this!\nI want a outsider their view, and I hope you could \"choose\" her side so I can still try and make it work and not feel played like a idiot .\n\n\nVery current update, she just told me she is being committed to a mental hospital because of Crisis and stability.\nShe has no idea for how long she'll stay there, but she did tell me she still wants to work on our relationship....\nI'm confused as hell\n\nTLDR\nBeen in a relationship with a complicated woman for 6 months and she still doesn't want to see me weekly.\n",

Visit you on the weekends = sex.  So what I see going on here is in your mind you are trying to help her in her life paying for stuff, making her feel better and all of that but you really just want her to be there on the weekends (for sex).\n\nShe's onto the game and using you, and you are still holding out for hope.  Her telling you she committed herself again is a way of prolonging you to pay for her stuff but not have to visit you anymore.\n\nMy advice is to cut ties, work on your own life, if you don't even have working heat in your house why are you buying her stuff?",

        "post-author": "pkd0110",
        "text": "\nMy girlfriend (20F) and my parents don\u2019t get along, and now I (20M) feel stuck in the middle\n\nBody:\nI\u2019ve been dating my girlfriend since high school \u2014 about 2 years now. We\u2019re both 19 and currently sophomores in college. Things between us have been great, but there\u2019s a serious issue with how she and my family (especially my parents and brother) get along \u2014 or rather, don\u2019t get along.\n\nThe latest problem started on Easter. She came over to my parents\u2019 house, brought a gift, dressed nicely, and made conversation during dinner. After she left, my parents told me they thought she was rude and disrespectful, especially to my older brother. They said she rolled her eyes every time he spoke and that she\u2019s done this for years (though I honestly haven\u2019t noticed that). They also said she came off as cold and dismissive toward them.\n\nMy girlfriend was shocked to hear that. From her perspective, she\u2019s always tried to be polite, and she feels like my parents never really liked her and are constantly looking for reasons to dislike her. Because of that, she no longer feels comfortable coming over. She thinks anything she does will be twisted into something negative.\n\nNow my parents are asking for an apology from her. It\u2019s been about a month and she hasn\u2019t apologized, because she doesn\u2019t feel like she did anything wrong. Meanwhile, my parents say they\u2019re losing what little respect they had for her, and it\u2019s clear they don\u2019t want her around until she \u201cmakes things right.\u201d\n\nSo now I\u2019m stuck. I love her and want this relationship to work, but I also want peace with my family. I hate this tension, and it\u2019s hard feeling like I have to pick a side. I\u2019ve tried talking to both sides, but neither is budging. I don\u2019t even know what a \u201csolution\u201d looks like anymore.\n\nIf anyone\u2019s been through something like this or has advice on how to move forward, I\u2019d really appreciate it.\n\nTL;DR:\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years, but she and my parents don\u2019t get along. After Easter dinner, my parents said she was rude and disrespectful, especially to my brother. She says they\u2019ve never liked her and now refuses to go over. My parents want an apology, she refuses, and I\u2019m stuck in the middle trying to keep the peace. Not sure what to do.\n",

As time went on, we remained friends but now 5 years out of college, I am realizing we have nothing in common and I am only friends with her out of pity. She has no other friends, she doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend, she gets mixed in with the wrong people and she is always always ALWAYS dumping her problems onto me as if I am her therapist (funny enough she is an actual licensed therapist).\n\nI feel as if I am obligated to stay friends with her. I don\u2019t care for her and am tired of being that support system for her. I am tired of receiving her texts and constant requests to hang out. I am not interested in continuing to be her \u2018friend\u2019 but feel forced to continue out of pity. Don\u2019t know what exactly to do here.

When she texts you, take hours or even a day to respond. When you do respond, keep conversation superficial. When she dumps her problems onto you, respond in a way that isn't helpful. If she's looking for advice, offer bland sympathy. If she's just looking for sympathy, butt in with your two cents. Cut down on how often you hang out with her and occasionally flake out on meeting up. Cut evenings out short by claiming to need to get home and rest or whatever.

        "text": "So my gf and I have been dating for a year and 4 months and lately I've been feeling kinda depressed, sad, and emotionless especially with my gf and I hate it. I want to be able to have those same feelings back again as I used to have and I've been trying. I take her out on dates, do activities together, go out to bars, get high, and stuff but just the feeling isn't coming back. We went out to this club on Saturday it was like emo night which had a lot of the music that we like (it wasn't really emo music, it was more punk, rock, metal, and some emo music) and she would always be holding me or holding my hand but for some reason I was getting annoyed? Like I just wanted to enjoy the music and dance without her holding me every 5 seconds.\n\nI've been starting to realize that besides some same music taste, some same food tastes, drinking, smoking weed, we don't have a lot in common. I like to have deeper conversations and like to kinda analyze things and talk about them with my partner but when I try to do that, she just listens and doesn't provide a lot of input, I mean she does sometimes but a lot of the time she just ends the conversation. A lot of our conversations are surface level and only deep conversations we have are about her dreams. I feel like I'm not being challenged at all. Maybe it's the fact that we are in different stages of life? Idk because I have a career as a nurse and she's still a server at a restaurant so sometimes it's kinda hard to talk about things that happen at work you know?\n\nI also work 6 days a week so when I'm not at work I'm with her so it does take a bit of a toll since I don't have a lot of time for myself. We like some of the same shows/movies but it's hard to find A LOT of shows/movies we both like so sometimes it does bother me and it feels like I'm not able to enjoy the things I like since I'm always with her if not at work and feel like I'm expected to do things with her only. We do go out to casinos (which sometimes I get annoyed cause she spends a lot on keno sometimes and wants me to play with her which I don't mind but she spends a lot and when I say I'm done and don't wanna take out anymore, she would take out money from her own account so I can play with her but I feel bad when she does it and always deny it but she gets upset so I end up feeling bad of her getting upset that I'm like fine and take it out my account or just sometimes be okay with her money), we go to bars (which also have keno so we always play when we go out to bars haha) and we go out to dinner or breakfast or we just stay in.\n\nShe does do a lot for me which I'm super grateful for. She likes to cook for me, surprise me with dessert, supports me, and is very loving which I love about her but I can't shake this emotionless feeling I've been having around her and it's really taking a toll on me. I'm feeling depressed. I do fantasize about being single as well which I don't like either. I hate this feeling and I feel like a POS for feeling this way. She's always saying she loves me, she misses me, and says a lot of sweet things to me but I'm just indifferent about it sometimes and say it back just to say it back. Idk if it's the fact that I need time for myself or this is me falling out of love. I honestly don't know if I can get those feelings I once had with her before. \n\nTL:DR: think I'm falling out of love for my gf and I hate it. Idk what to do if we should break up or try to get that spark again. We're just two different people in different stages of life and it is starting to eat me up. I'm often fantasizing about being single and idk if this is normal or a phase I'm going through. I feel bad and a POS for thinking like this...",

        "text": "I am (38M) who has dated my gf (42F) for 5 years now (met in 2020). Since we dated, I had to plan everything from dates to trips. I'm just realizing this now that I had to make all the effort. This year, I wanted to do something special for our anniversary and take us to Peru in which I'll be paying for everything. I asked her since I am working overtime and working on settling in a house I just bought, if she can help with looking at accommodations. I sent her an interirary I made with everything we are doing the 2 weeks we are there and if she can just pick hotels she likes. Well, it has been 2 months and I ask almost daily if she even looked at the itinerary because we leave soon and hotels are being booked. I told her I need her help and asked what she was doing the past 2 months and it's the same story: I am spending time with my friends or spending time with her dad and too busy. I could have easily chosen the hotels but I want to know that she cares. And in the past, the places I have chosen she always comments on that she could have chosen better (then why not choose them!). I can't believe I have to beg someone to go to a paid vacation. Peru is somewhere I've wanted to go to since 1995. I'm thinking of cancelling the trip altogether and going by myself. Am I wasting my time with her? I feel we are too old for this bullsh*t.\n\nTo add more insight, I had schedule this trip at a specific time frame that worked best for her and her friends. This time frame pretty inconvenient for me since I go back to work the following day I come back from the trip. I've had to plan dates around her friends schedule since I met her. Everything has been snow balling emotionally the past year in the number of times she has bailed on me for other people. I am at a point where I am constantly thinking about ending things but worried this is trivial or non-issue thing to complain about. I can't see myself dealing with this anymore.\n\ntl;dr: Is it worth continuing a relationship if you aren't the priority? I personally couldn't marry someone doing this to me. Or do I try other forms of communication to salvage it?",

It might turn out she never wanted to go in the first place. But it sounds like there's a deeper issue running here than what you described. If you think it's beyond repair or you have to continue with your dignity at stake, I'll suggest you move on, as harsh as it sounds.",

Before I met her, I always traveled alone so it's not an issue.\nI'm going to talk to her today about the whole priority thing and see if anything is bothering her on this relationship or could be saved. It could be that I haven't asked her to marry me as someone said in the comments. But then, I'd be married and the lowest priority in her life. Will see.\u00a0",

Unfortunately, there are users out there and once they get a taste of you doing everything they will take and take. My advice is to do exactly what you stated and cancel the trip. If you want to end the relationship, then go without her. You know if you want to keep this girl then you can\u2019t go without her. Additionally, as much as you want to be her night in armor, time to pull back on all of that work for her you are doing. Cancelling the trip is the first step and come up with a reasonable explanation, which I am sure you can do. If you want to keep the relationship, don\u2019t tell her you are canceling it because she failed at her only job. You just bought a home and the costs associated are a great excuse for why you are short on funds for date night, letting her know it\u2019s her turn to pony up.

I actually bought the house for her with a large backyard since she lives in a tiny house with no backyard. I'm still setting up furniture lol. The backyard was so she can host parties for her friends since she kept saying how she wished she had a backyard for parties.

So, you\u2019re saying that she wasn\u2019t all that excited about the trip in the first place? Given that you triple checked with her on all of this and shelled out the money, some of which is likely non-refundable and yet she still didn\u2019t do her only job. Only you know her mindset, maybe she doesn\u2019t know her mind herself, but I have to believe that canceling on her and you going alone is a great way to end the relationship. Maybe I am wrong and she legitimately didn\u2019t want to go but something tells me she does but she wants you to do all the work. I\u2019m thinking that if I canceled and said I am going myself then that would likely end the relationship and maybe that\u2019s what you want. The problem here is that you want to go and you gave her a simple task and now your hand is forced to either go by yourself or scramble to secure the type of lodging she\u2019d like and not complain.  Sounds like you have a good relationship but you\u2019re doing a lot of the work and no appreciation for your effort. You\u2019re going to talk with her tonight and basically say that you are questioning the relationship because she didn\u2019t plan some hotels. You and I know the issues are deeper than that and I hope you go into this discussion, well prepared. Otherwise, you\u2019re going to end up spinning in circles if all you have is her being frugal and allowing you to pay and plan everything. Her response is that she loves you and she didn\u2019t know that her not having the financial means was a deal breaker because in the end that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get from her. If you\u2019re ready to move on from this girl then just do it and forget the talk because she is who she is and she\u2019s not changing. If you\u2019re okay with carrying the load and not being appreciated then accept it and keep her. I\u2019m not even sure a brow beating is worth the effort tonight, just tell you\u2019re going solo to Machu Pichu. It does not matter how much money you have or don\u2019t have but a woman who doesn\u2019t appreciate her man is not a good sign.",

However, I have serious reservations which is putting me off the idea. \n\nHer Dad is obbessed with conspiracy theories, Anti Medicine, screams, shouts and swears when confronted. He never calls her unless she calls him; he never visits her, only her visiting him even though he lives doors away. He has threatened every member of family. He does not take responsibility for anything that has happened in his life and goes crazy if challenged on any of his views. Blaming his aggression as out of his control, followed by a sob story and crying.\n\nHer Mum treats her like a child, she is very immature and loves family drama and gossip. \n\nHer mum and dad are not together but still obsessively stay in touch. They point score and can often be insufferable, the roles are reversed. Dad living with sister due to dad not being able manage his finances as wastes all money on Cigerettes and Cannabis. Mum is every emotional and demands children's attention. \n\nMy GF is submissive to them both, can never challenge their views, so let's dad fall deeper in to his views and his behaviour is widely accepted within the family. Same cycle of dad being abusive, apologies, crys they all hug him.\n\nI cannot bring a child in to this environment. I need her to prove to me that she can stand up to them and do what's best for her and our future child. Right now I don't believe she can. \n\nIs this too much for to ask of her? \n\nAny tips on what she can do? \n\nShe is planning a 30th girls night out, even this she felt compelled to invite her dad to avoid upsetting him. Whenever I try to talk to her about standing up she runs away in to another room\n\nAnother example of something really wrong is that last year her nan passed away, her dad during his daughters grieving keeps saying she was murdered by the NHS and trying show weird autopsy videos. When she asked him stop he kicked off.\n\nPlease help\n\nTL;DR Dad & Parents controlling, GF is scared confrontation. Putting me off children. Need advice.",

You should not have children with this person and you should also probably not be dating this person.\n\nLet's put aside the crazy family for a moment. When you bring problems to your girlfriend, she *runs away* from you into another room. She's so averse to either hearing criticism about herself and/or talking out relationship issues that she is literally, physically running away from them. How could you ever hope to work out disagreements and overcome obstacles in life with such a person?\n\nNow, let's get to the parents. Your girlfriend's dad, though odious and possibly dangerous, is apparently not a problem unless your girlfriend invites him to be so - he does not reach out. But she deliberately chooses to invite this chaos and potential danger into her life by reaching to *him*. She is so far in that she reached out to invite him to her girls night out birthday party. She is submissive to him, which means she is not ever going to stand up to him. If you have children with her, he will always be in your life, and you will not be able to get rid of him or really avoid him - because his presence is controlled solely by someone who runs away from the idea of standing up to him.\n\nYou have to accept the reality of who your girlfriend is today, not who she would be if she followed the ideal path, especially if she shows no indication that she agrees that even is the ideal path.",

So, that leaves you at the present moment -your GF knows how you feel, but keeps on involving her parents in everything anyway. Of course, I think this is a bad move on her part, but this is clearly what she wants to do. You have already expressed your opposition to her behavior and she has chosen to continue it anyway.  I'm going to take a different angle here and say it's you who needs to make the biggest change at this point: You need to learn respect of your GF's choices and also learn acceptance of reality. She has clearly made her choice and you need to respect and accept that instead of asking her to change. If she wanted to change, she would have already. Respect and accept that reality.\n\nYou are a person who wants to have kids and it would not be healthy to bring a child into that environment. She doesn't care. Accept this. If you do indeed want children, you have a responsibility to ensure their safety and that means not having them in an environment you think will be bad for them. The way forward is clear.",

        "text": "Okay so I\u2019ve (19M) been talking with this friend (19F) for about 4 or 5 years now through instagram. The origin story is that I saw her regularly at a weekly social event, thought she was cool, but never really talked with her much. Months after moving away to Chicago, I reached out to her on a total whim. I didn\u2019t have much confidence that she would answer, as we honestly didn\u2019t know each other very much, but she did. \n\nCut to today. We talk roughly once every three months, just making casual conversation. She has a lovely boyfriend. To be clear, we were never anything romantic, and what little romantic interest I had entertained before is long gone. There\u2019s no honest way it would work out. But she\u2019s still a blast to talk to, and I\u2019m generally pretty isolated otherwise so I sort of cling to bygone people. \n\nThe question that\u2019s weighing on me is why the hell does she stick with me, too?\n\nI feel like any other person in her position would have ghosted me by now. But she likes all my posts, has hearted many of my messages recently(and when I pointed it out she playfully pouted and teased me back), and often replies within the day. \n\nBut the real tipping point, the catalyst behind this whole post here today, is this: I was looking for any kind of clue that she may have had a crush on me. We follow each other on Spotify, which I rarely even use, but I scanned through her playlists there\u2026 on a few separate lists, I noticed a wave of songs with bittersweet lyrics (conveying people drifting away, someone you find comfort in, unrequited feelings, frustration) that were added on dates that directly aligned with dates we had wrapped up a conversation on. Obviously it could be coincidental, and she\u2019s in an amazing relationship elsewhere that I have no intention of spoiling, but I secretly sort of hope those songs are about me. \n\nDo you think that I should confront her about my suspicions? Should I be straight to the point or ease into it more naturally? I just plan on asking, \u201cWhy did you choose to stay with me after all this time? Is it because you\u2019re lonely, clinging on to the past, or something else?\u201d\n\nTL;DR I think that a long-distance friend has had romantic feelings for me but never said anything about it. I feel like I have positive signals, but I want outside reassurance and am worried about being wrong. I don\u2019t want to drift apart on a bitter note\u2026 I just want to make it clear between us.

        "post-author": "ReasonableEbb7094",
        "text": "I [22F] and my [M25] boyfriend have been together officially for 7 years. We took a break last year, I broke up with him because I felt as though my needs weren't being met and I felt neglected and like I wasn't important to him. \n\nWe've been seeing each other regularly for the last year but he doesn't want to put a label on anything yet. He's currently in school and his family basically hates me for leaving him for someone else. \n\nFor some background information to better understand, his family is very emotionally unavailable and I came from a very emotional family and have learned its best to talk things out and express emotions and feelings instead of sweeping them under the rug. \n\nHis mother would make fun of me for not knowing basic things in front of their family members and make fun of personal problems I have with sensory things and he would never say anything in my defense after expressing that it hurt my feelings.They would bash my family and judge me if I ever came to them for guidance as I do not stay in contact with my own family anymore and don't have many friends thinking I could come to her as she'd call me the daughter she never had.\n\nOver the years I felt like I did most of the sacrificing in our relationship, driving every weekend to see him after he refused to leave his apartment with his roommates to spend the weekend at my apartment where I lived alone because he didn't have his PC with him or he didn't have his rig. \n\nWe spent a limited amount of time together alone without videogames or getting high, mainly when we'd run errands or be waiting for his friends to get home, from work, or watching tiktoks. When his friends got home I'd basically be sitting around bored for hours and sometimes crying because I felt left out and unwanted. His friend is very disrespectful to women and would subject him to grossly inappropriate content and games where he'd be playing as an unrealistic nude girl with unlimited customization options. \n\nWhen we would be intimate together, he'd always ask me to dress up and basically be something that I'm not, it got to the point where he'd be watching porn while we were doing things and there was a few times that I would cry or break down during it and it was just awful and extremely unhealthy for my already existing insecurities from being body shamed my whole life by my family, I weigh 230lbs and have a nice figure for my weight and height. \n\nI was very verbal through the entirety of our relationship with how he made me feel, making me be something I'm not, never complimenting me after basically asking in every way possible, never emotionally being there for me when I was going through personal and family problems. Sometimes I feel like we're incompatible but I love him very deeply and part of me feels that way because he was my first intimate partner but Im in love with him.\n\nOver they years I discovered his porn addiction and him micro cheating in private chat rooms. I've also found a post on hook up pages on Reddit which he swore he never followed through with physically but did meet up with a girl and smoked weed together and watched tv apparently. His social media algorithms are so personalized that even on Facebook he can't scroll for like two minutes without seeing boobs or something inappropriate. On tiktok is ads for sexy outfits, girls thrist trapping like every 10 to 15 videos. He's now asking about me wearing more specific things which im not entirely comfortable with.. I love him so I want to make him happy but I'm also afraid that I'm disrespecting myself and if I say no he'll find it somewhere else or resort back to chat rooms if he ever stopped that to begin with.. we're not even officially together but we're exclusive according to him, even though he won't tell anyone about us and we aren't living together.. \n\nI've talked to my friends about this many many times over the years and they all say the same thing, that it's not a good match, he isn't treating me the way a boyfriend should, that I deserve better. In my heart I think I  know that but I don't know what I'd do without him. He understands me so well but at the same time not in the ways I need him to understand me. We've talked about doing relationship counseling but even if we do, I'm scared his family will still hate me and be unkind to me and I'm worried that I'll still feel this way. \n\nTl;dr - what to do? Am I in the wrong, should I be more understanding and supportive? Am I allowing myself to be mistreated? Advice ",

Both of them regrets. (Which is a little dumb on my part, because I did learn a lot and am the person I am, because of them. I just stayed for way tooooooo long!!

Of the young part of my life, when I should have been out having Fun! No kids.... Few bills....no real responsibility. \n\n\nThe 20's are for laughing and learning and exploring!

Go on a road trip!! \n\nThis is YOUR TIME!! Get out there and see what's going on!!",

        "post-author": "ThrowRA_TheScotsman",
        "text": "As the title implies, I\u2019ve been with my partner a few months. I\u2019ve always had issues ejaculating whilst having penetrative sex. I can honestly say she is the only one I\u2019ve ever been able to do this with, and I also ejaculate when she gives me a blowjob.\n\nHowever I do sometimes struggle to ejaculate, which has nothing whatsoever to do with her. I think I just get anxious about it because I\u2019ve struggled with it for so long and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. Sometimes I fake an orgasm/ejaculation, and I\u2019m worried she may have noticed, we don\u2019t use condoms anymore. She hasn\u2019t given any signs necessarily that she has noticed, but the fear is there nonetheless.\n\nI won\u2019t fake orgasm again, but I have a few questions: women, what are the chances that she\u2019ll have noticed? And more generally, is there a way I can broach this topic whilst reassuring her that it has nothing to do with her? Would be grateful for any advice or any experiences anyone would be willing to share with me.\n\nTL;DR: I have delayed ejaculation issues, I\u2019m in a brilliant relationship and the sex is great but how can I broach my issues honestly with her whilst ensuring she doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s anything to do with her.",

Having an awkward conversation will probably end up bringing you even closer. \n\n\nShe can tell if you ejaculate inside her or not.  She knows when there\u2019s nothing there, because nothing comes out of her later.\n\n\nAlso, women can often feel the difference right before and during ejaculation.  \n\nOdds are very VERY high that she knows you\u2019ve been faking.  And she\u2019s probably blaming herself.  So have that difficult conversation sooner rather than later.",

My current thinking is that I just need to tell her that she turns me on, I get hard even when we hug and kiss lightly, I\u2019m extremely attracted to her, I can still cum easily when she does oral, I just sometimes have issues cumming inside because of anxiety but it\u2019s nothing to do with her. I don\u2019t know whether I should mention having faked it before, because there is a chance she hasn\u2019t noticed and if I brought it up it has the potential to open another can of worms.",

He's settled abroad with a good job, while I've been trying to build my career. I started out pursuing a professional qualification in finance but faced setbacks and now am working toward a different certification that would allow me to eventually move and work abroad. \nI worked at a well-known company for about 15 months, but the pay was quite low, and I struggled to balance work with studying. I eventually quit to focus on exams full-time. I've cleared part of my exams and working towards finishing the rest. I do want to work again and be financially independent - just need time to get qualified. \nWe recently spoke to our families about getting married. While mine is supportive, his parents - especially his father - are not very enthusiastic, mainly because I'm not currently employed. I heard he made a disrespectful comment about that. My partner stood up for me, but it still hurts. Feels like I'm being judged solely based on my job status. They not only expect me to be employed but to have a well-paying job before I'll be considered \"good enough\".\n\nMy partner  says he supports me regardless, but his family is pushing him to marry soon, and I'm not sure how long he can hold out. All of this is making me feel pressured and undervalued, and it's affecting my ability to focus on my exams. \n\nHow do I talk to him about this without making things worse with his family? And how do I stay focused on my goal--  finishing my exams and building my career - without letting  this get to me?\n\nTL;DR: In a long term LDR, my boyfriend's family is pressuring him to marry soon and judging me because I don't currently have a high paying job. I quit my low paying job to focus on a professional certification and want to be independent, but their comments are affecting my mental space and focus. My boyfriend supports me, but I'm unsure how to talk to him about his family without making things worse. Need advice on handling this pressure and stay focused on my goals. ",

        "post-author": "Unusual-East6448",
        "text": "\nFor starters, we\u2019re all 16 and last night after an argument with my girlfriend (of two months), let\u2019s hypothetically name her Stacy, I realised her best friend (Megan, hypothetically) was a huge factor as to why it occurred. \n\nPretty much, yesterday was a perfectly normal day, checked up on my girlfriend, Stacy, throughout the day because she was sick, sent her reels, etc. \n\nThen, in the evening, I decided to try this thing where I delete Instagram whenever I\u2019m studying, but I kinda forgot to tell her and pretty much don\u2019t respond to her messages for a couple hours or so, which doesn\u2019t seem like a huge deal. Then on Snapchat, she texts me \u201cwhere\u2019d you go\u201d, and I explain to her what I did and she doesn\u2019t seem too happy about it (also she seemed to be in a bad mood for the back half of the day anyway). \n\nI was feeling sleepy, so I said goodnight and stuff but instead of the usual \u201cgoodnight\u201d back, I get flamed for forgetting our two month anniversary THE PREVIOUS DAY. I try to explain to Stacy that I had a really rough and tiring day and pretty much got home and went to sleep, but before I finish explaining, she says \u201cr u done with me or something\u201d. I was genuinely so confused because in the moment, after the day seemingly went fine, this was quite literally out of fucking nowhere. \n\nI ask her why she thinks that, and she explains this is what happened (still not sure what actually was wrong at this stage), with her Megan\u2019s relationship. Then she tells me that Megan told her to \u201cend things with me before i do it first\u201d. Like what the fuck. At this stage I was still fully clueless. I ask if it\u2019s because I forgot the two month anniversary and she then says that Megan reads some of our texts and she thinks we \u201ctext like we hate each other\u201d. Like who the fuck is she to determine if we like each other or not based off a few texts. So i\u2019m trying to explain to Stacy, over text, that we should find a logical solution instead of going back and forth and she starts saying things like \u201cmb for saying anything\u201d, \u201cim sorry for ruining your sleep for this\u201d, but the context they were said in was very sarcastic and unapologetic. At this stage I just told her I\u2019m sorry for anything i\u2019ve done, said goodnight, and went to sleep.\n\nThen, in the morning I wake up, see that I have 5 missed calls from her (i was on do not disturb), and A HUGE PARAGRAPH, which in summary said \u201ci think we\u2019re taking things too fast, we should take a step back and build a strong foundation, we should take the pressure off (there\u2019s literally no pressure)\u201d, and all of this was okay until i read \u201ci think were not exactly in love right now but what we have is still really special we really like each other\u201d. I thought these were all Stacy\u2019s words at the time (they weren\u2019t). \n\nSo pretty much, I call Stacy, I explain my perspective, apologised for a bunch of minor things, and then ask \u201cwas Megan a factor in what happened last night\u201d. She said yes. Then she apologised for everything, said she let Megan get in her head, and that she was in a bad mood and stuff. I expressed my concern over this and she confirmed she won\u2019t let it happen again. Then she tells me that in the very long essay she sent me, Megan wrote half of it, mainly the parts where taking steps back and not loving each other were mentioned. This made me fume inside. \n\nWho the fuck does she think she is? Like her telling Stacy to break up with me before I do it first, WHEN I\u2019VE LITERALLY DOME NOTHING WRONG IS SO WEIRD. Apparently at their school as well, Megan emphasises that us two are taking it too fast and stuff. She needs to shut the fuck up and mind her own business. Megan single-handedly created a huge argument between Stacy and I over quite literally fucking nothing. Stacy is all good with the pace of the relationship and she\u2019s made it clear multiple times, and even today all of a sudden everything  magically seemed okay after the call we had in the morning.\n\nMy concern now is, what if Megan tries to pull this shit again. Idk if she\u2019s jealous or what, but to me it\u2019s currently a threat that hasn\u2019t gone away. The outcome I am looking for is the best  way forward and what I should do next.\n\nTL;DR Girlfriend\u2019s bsf influenced her to start an argument with me out of literally nothing, told her to \u201cbreakup with him before he does it first\u201d out of nowhere. It was completely baseless. The outcome I am looking for is the best  way forward and what I should do next.\n\n\n",

The other night I had a gut feeling to go through his phone, which I\u2019ve never done, and found multiple flirty texts to other women. I immediately confronted him about it and he\u2019s been swearing up and down he\u2019ll change, never do it again, and will do anything to regain my trust. I know it could just be words, but I truly love him and I really feel like he loves me- he treats me like an absolute queen and has never shown any major red flags like this. He admitted he did it out of insecurity and wanting compliments back, which stunned me because I call him handsome like ten times a day. He said he didn\u2019t truly mean anything he said and that they mean nothing to him, he just wanted attention. Should I believe that? He feels like my best friend and boyfriend in one, I\u2019ve never felt in love before him. I know I should probably leave him, but I think part of me truly thinks he could fix this. Should I leave him now and move on, or give a second chance?\n\ntldr- boyfriend sent flirty texts to other girls because of insecurity reasons. Give him a second chance or move on? Thanks yall. ",

If you find out and stay with him, you\u2019re letting him know (even subconsciously) he can ignore your needs and boundaries and you\u2019ll out up with it.\n\n3. He \u2018s playing on insecurities as an excuse, which is a massive warning sign for emotional abuse (10 year abuse survivor here). He betrayed you, but when confronted claims it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t feel good enough. This engages your sympathy and challenges you to be the one to prove to him he IS good enough. Giant red flag. He isn\u2019t good enough, not because of his looks but because he\u2019s already hurting and disrespecting you and asking you to accept so he can know he\u2019s enough. No. No no no\n\nBreak up and move on, before he gets his hooks too deep is my honest advice. It ain\u2019t easy but putting off the pain of separation won\u2019t help in the long run either, you\u2019ll have to go through it eventually, the question is how much will you let him put you through first and how much PTSD will you have by that time (I\u2019m riddled with it and STILL struggle to leave my house, so that\u2019s fun).

I like her and tend to think about her a lot and I also do feel that she likes me back as well but still checking me out ( I say this cuz when I flirt she flirts back with me ). But through our interactions I sometimes doubt if I can have a healthy relationship with her because many a times I feel like I can't have long conversations with her which is also due to us having almost no common grounds to talk about. I do feel that this is normal but I also feel ( partly due to my older experiences ) that atleast when the relationship is in its early stages couples tend to try to spend time with each other every moment they can. But even If I feel like pursuing her might be a recipe for disaster but I can't stop being attracted to her. \nWhat I am asking here is how I should go ahead from here, what should I think of these feelings of doubt. And should I still try to date her, if yes how should I go about it for a healthy relationship ?\n\nTl:dr I can't  have long conversations with the girl I like but still keep getting attracted to her and am wondering if I should stop pursuing her or still try to form a relationship",

        "text": "Hi Reddit. I don\u2019t really post, but I need to vent and maybe get some advice because I feel completely lost right now.\n\nI (23F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for almost two years. We\u2019ve talked about moving in together soon, and while I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m also nervous. I have anxiety, and it really affects how I process emotions and interact with the world. I overthink *everything*. I also tend to cry a lot when I\u2019m overwhelmed, which makes it hard to communicate clearly and it makes me feel ashamed.\n\nOver the long weekend, I went to visit my boyfriend. He lives one town over. He was playing video games, and I didn\u2019t want to just stare at my iPad after working 40 hours that week, so I went to the living room to watch a new reality show instead. About 30 minutes later, he came out and (in what felt like an aggressive tone) said:  \n\u201cCan you stop having an attitude?\u201d\n\nThat completely threw me off. I didn\u2019t even realize anything was wrong. When I tried to ask what he meant, I got overwhelmed and started crying as I genuinely didn\u2019t know what I had done. He apologized, but I still felt hurt and confused.\n\nThen, as all this was going on, his parents walked in (they had just come in from out of town), and I had to immediately act like nothing was wrong. Internally, I was falling apart. I ended up crying nonstop sunday and monday.\n\nI eventually left early and went back to my apartment. When I got home, I called him and tried to explain what I was feeling. I said something like: \u201cHey, I\u2019ve been sitting with a lot from this weekend. I know you\u2019re stressed with work stuff, and I really do get that. I just ended up feeling really shut out, and when things got tense, I didn\u2019t feel emotionally okay staying. I also know I shut down around your parents  I just felt exhausted and didn\u2019t know how to talk about it.\"\n\nHis immediate response was: \u201cI think you need to go back to therapy.\u201d\n\nThat hurt. I know he\u2019s stressed, but I felt dismissed. It made me question everything. Since then, we\u2019ve been distant. I love him a lot, but now I\u2019m wondering\u2026 is it over? Did I mess this all up?\n\nTLDR: I (23F) visited my boyfriend (26M) over the weekend. He got upset and told me to \u201cstop having an attitude\u201d when I was just watching TV alone. I got overwhelmed, started crying, and felt really dismissed. His parents walked in mid-breakdown, and I had to pretend I was fine. I left early and tried to calmly explain my feelings later, but he just told me I \u201cneed to go back to therapy.\u201d Now we\u2019re distant, and I feel confused, ashamed, and wondering if this relationship is right or if I messed it all up.

I have anxiety, so I know just how it feels to cry for two days because someone lashed out at you when you didn't know anything was wrong, and you can't regulate your emotions to the point where you can have a calm discussion. It's horrible. It's a miserable, exhausting way to live. Imagine a life for yourself where, rather than getting stuck in a nightmare house of mirrors of your own insecurities and worst fears, you can sit with negative emotions, process them efficiently, and then move on with your day.

        "text": "TL;DR:\nMy boyfriend and I (23F, 24M) have been together for over 3.5 years\u2014starting with a long-distance relationship and now living together in Australia for 1.5 years. We haven\u2019t spent a single day apart in that time, and we\u2019ve built a safe, loving life together. I want to visit my family and friends in India for 3 weeks, but he can\u2019t come due to work and finances. While he understands why I need to go, he\u2019s emotionally struggling with the idea of being alone at home. I feel really guilty and heavy about leaving him, even though we plan to stay connected. I\u2019m looking for advice on how to better handle these emotions and this situation.\n\n------------\n\nHi! I'm a 23F and my bf is 24M. We have been together for over 3.5 years. We are living together for over a year a half now in AU. Before moving countries and living together, we were in an LDR for over two years, having met only once in that period. We live internationally while our families are based in India. We both are working, he works in office and I WFH - which kinda gives me a lot of flexibility.\n\nI haven't visited my family (parents and brother) and my friends back home in all this time. He hasn't either, and for even longer - about 3 years now. Me and him have not spent a single day apart in this period. It has brought us close in a different way that makes me bawl my eyes out of adoration for this man. We are content and we have built a lifestyle here, which makes me feel very safe.\n\nAlthough I have stayed connected to my family and friends regularly, I really wanted to go on a short three week break back home to meet everyone. My partner cannot make it with me because of his work and financial commitments - he really does want to but that would a callous decision considering his responsibilities. We are both upset about me leaving for a short time, but he is a bit more affected by this change because he would be alone at home, in a space that he's always shared with me. He said he understands why I need to go but there's this beautiful and vulnerable side to him which is asking me to stay back.\n\nFor some reason, I'm feeling guilt and this heaviness thinking about leaving. I reassured him that we will stay connected like we did when we were in LDR - but I still want to know how to handle this better.\n\nCan anyone give me a perspective? Or any advice that might help me better navigate through this situation?\n\n\n\n",

That said, it\u2019s okay to feel torn\u2014love can make these moments feel heavier than they are. But here\u2019s the thing: a healthy relationship should breathe. Being apart for a few weeks isn\u2019t a threat\u2014it\u2019s an opportunity.\n\nInstead of guilt, try to reframe it: Would you want him to feel bad for visiting his family after years apart? Exactly. You\u2019re not abandoning him, you\u2019re going home to refill a part of your soul. And truthfully, if he\u2019s emotionally struggling with being alone for a short time, that\u2019s something he should reflect on too\u2014it\u2019s not on you to carry both of your emotions all the time.\n\nHere\u2019s something that helps: ask yourself, \u201cIf my younger sister or best friend were in this exact situation, what would I tell her?\u201d Probably something like: \u201cGo. Be with your people. Love is still here when you get back.\u201d\n\nMaintain the connection\u2014FaceTime, sweet little voice notes, funny updates. But don\u2019t overcompensate. You don\u2019t need to prove your love just because you\u2019re going away. Let him miss you a little. Missing someone isn't a bad thing\u2014it reminds us how much we value them.\n\nWishing you peace, perspective, and a joyful reunion on the other side. \ud83d\udc9b",

The world is a big and vast place and it\u2019s never good to narrow it down to focusing it on one person.  Go visit your family and have a great time, call him with updates and stories and come home and help him plan a trip of his own.",

        "text": "So, the for the past few months I (35M) was in a relationship with someone (37F) who, due to a few different factors that I won\u2019t go into, was in a very tough situation in life where she eventually told me she was unable to support a relationship. It took me a while to understand or accept this, and to be honest I still don\u2019t know if I do. I fell for her fast after we started talking, and thought the course of my life was leading me to being with her forever. After she had told me she didn\u2019t feel she could sustain a healthy relationship, communication dipped and I wasn\u2019t able to see her for weeks at a time. When I did finally meet her for lunch one day a little over a month ago, she explained her situation to me, and how she didn\u2019t foresee things getting better for her for at least a year once she was done with school. She had apparently understood that to be a breakup talk, and I wasn\u2019t aware that\u2019s what it was. I thought that if I held out a little longer, eventually we\u2019d be able to reconnect and start spending more time together again. When we met next a few weeks later, something felt wrong. I can\u2019t explain it, but my body was telling me something was wrong. Over the next few weeks she stopped sharing her location with me and hid her relationship status on Facebook.\n\nThis past weekend, I finally sent her a message explaining my need to move on with my life, that I couldn\u2019t just sit in misery anymore, but my hope that we could reconnect when she was ready. I still love her, and sending that message was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever had to do. She understood and was sorry that I had been feeling the way I had been feeling.\n\nWhat I discovered this weekend is that Instagram now has a feature where you can see what your friends like on reels. And the posts that\u2019s she\u2019s liked recently (I checked when they were posted) are all about having a new relationship and how \u201che\u201d makes you feel and a whole lot of other suggestive stuff. Am I overreacting to be thinking that she has been seeing someone else already, despite telling me that she had no capacity to date anyone and that she viewed me as the only person she would ever want to be with?\n\nMy overthinking about this has kept me up for the past several nights. I haven\u2019t been able to get a full nights sleep since I realized this was something I could see. If she didn\u2019t want to be with me, I wish she would have just flat out told me that and not left me in this state. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing posting this here, just needed to vent to the void I guess.\n\ntl;dr - How do I combat my overthinking about someone I love telling me they can\u2019t support a relationship with me when I suspect they may have already moved on with someone else?",

It is shitty, and she should have told you flat out, but most likely she was trying to protect your feelings and preserve you from being more heart broken and feeling undesirable. My advice is to look at it from the perspective of you winning in this situation. If she IS with someone new, then she wasn\u2019t never as \u201call in\u201d as you were, and you deserve someone who is. Don\u2019t waste your time wishing someone wanted you.",

But today I had a really bad day and before the situation that caused the bad day happened, I messaged my boyfriend in the morning and asked him if he wanted to watch a movie I saw on TikTok. He said yeah we can. We normally call every night and sometimes we watch movies because we don\u2019t live together. and I waited the whole day for him to be free so we can finally watch the movie. I\u2019ve been wanting to watch for a couple days now. It was getting late. And he had work tomorrow. So I asked him how long is he going to be so that we can start watching. He then said that he\u2019s going outside, this was around 11pm and he came home at 1 am. And this movie is about two hours long, so I was a bit mad because I knew he would\u2019ve ended up falling asleep halfway into the movie. And I was waiting all day to watch this movie. I then told him that I\u2019m mad because he came late. And that he would\u2019ve fell asleep during the movie. I also told him that I waited the whole day for him. He just kind of brushed it and said okay we can watch something else at episode of something. And I told him that no I wanted to watch this movie specifically and I waited the whole day. He then said for me to just watch it on my own and he doesn\u2019t understand that I\u2019m upset. \n\n\nIs he disregarding my feelings? I feel like he doesn\u2019t care about how he makes me feel. \nAnd I\u2019m stuck between sticking through the disrespect because I love him and we have a lot history together or leaving because of the disrespect. I just feel like he doesn\u2019t love me as much as he did because he would have never responded the way he did. Am I being over emotional? little stuff like this always happens but i feel like this is the last straw. \n\n\n\nTLDR- i just don\u2019t think he respects me enough anymore or cares about my feelings. is it a phase bc i don\u2019t have it in me to carry on like this.

        "text": "I (28F) live with my boyfriend (27M) in a big city. We\u2019ve been together for 9 years, living together for 3. This weekend, two old friends visited me from out of town \u2014 \u201cS,\u201d(28F), a close friend since we were 11 with her BF (28M), and \u201cT,\u201d(28F), who became friends with us when we were 16-17. All of us grew up in a large city back home, but now live in different places.\n\nT lives alone in a small, isolating town and has to go into work every day. I work remotely in marketing. During the trip, she kept making comments like, *\u201cYou don\u2019t understand how isolating it is,\u201d* and *\u201cYou come home to someone every day \u2014 that\u2019s different.\u201d* I absolutely understand it\u2019s hard to live alone \u2014 my brother has gone through the same. But it felt like she was attacking me for having a different life.\n\nThere were other things too. She wanted to invite her friend (28F) to join us for ice cream. That friend lived 20 mins away by public transport \u2014 but due to some construction, T claimed it was shut and said she had to walk 45 mins instead. But it wasn\u2019t shut \u2014 there were replacement routes. Later, her friend told us she *chose* to walk because she felt safer, which made me feel like T unnecessarily blamed me.\n\nT also kept asking for things, asking for a home-cooked meal even though she was here only for a few days. I didn\u2019t mind cooking, but S found it weird and suggested we order instead. It felt like T was treating my place like a hotel at times. She\u2019s been to this city multiple times, while it was S\u2019s first visit, so I was trying to plan things S wanted to see. Still, T seemed bored and said she wanted to go home early because she was tired.\n\nThe night before T left, she made a heavy comment about how going back to her small town after being around people again was going to be a \u201cbad trip.\u201d She also brought up how her cousin felt terrible returning to a Western country after visiting home. I empathize, and I\u2019ve lived away from home too, but the way it was said made me feel like my life was being discounted because it\u2019s \u201cnot as hard.\u201d\n\nAfter she left, I confided in S \u2014 I thought we were on the same page about how intense and odd the trip felt. Initially, we both agreed T had been acting off. But after I shared more (and acknowledged I might be overthinking due to PMS or just general stress), I noticed S pulled back. It felt like maybe I said too much, and it changed how she viewed me. I even felt like S, who\u2019s always been more well-off and polished, was trying to subtly one-up me. Like when I offered her my perfume to try, and she just said, \u201cNo, I have mine,\u201d in a way that came off\u2026 snobbish?\n\nThere was another moment that stuck out \u2014 when I said I don\u2019t follow people from school on Instagram because I\u2019m not in touch with them anymore (edit). Both of them gave pretty strong reactions to that \u2014 it felt judgmental.\n\nTo be fair, I was running on little sleep, too much coffee and weed (not my usual), and I think the emotional buildup hit me hard. After they both left, I had a full-on breakdown. I felt like I ruined my friendships with both of them and like I\u2019d failed as a host. The whole thing brought up feelings of homesickness I\u2019d been suppressing for years.\n\n# I don\u2019t know how to process this. I feel distant from both friends now, and I\u2019m not sure if I should try to repair things or give them space and move on. How do I approach this \u2014 should I reach out and talk to them, or let the distance settle? How do you know when it\u2019s time to let go of friendships that feel different now?\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nTwo old friends (28F) visited me (28F). One (T) made me feel attacked and overwhelmed; the other (S) was initially supportive, then seemed distant. I felt like a bad host, had a breakdown after they left, and now I\u2019m wondering how to fix things \u2014 or if I should just move on. How do I handle this?",

Of course, you were there so you had access to tone, facial expression, and all context.\n\nBut your one friend just sounds like they are unhappy with work and where they live. From your paraphrasing you kept saying it FELT like they were implying something about your situation, but I don't actually see it. I see a sad friend trying to share their pain with you based off what you actually have quoted here. Unless you were also trying to express how unhappy you were and they were shutting you down, I don't think this sadness was a commentary on you.\n\nI have no idea what you mean by the transit example. Nobody seems to be implying anything. \n\nSimilarly, your example for your other friend is... that she didn't want to borrow your perfume because she had her own? \n\nDo you have social anxiety? You may want to be more careful about how you interpret other people's words. I know it can be hard to not hear negative things sometimes. I have a lot of anxiety too. But it makes friendships harder if you let anxious thoughts win.\n\nOf course, I could be wrong and you could have mean friends. In which case-- you're not required to remain anyone's friend.",

You\u2019re right that tone, delivery, and real-time context play a big role in how things are perceived, and that\u2019s hard to fully convey in a post.\n\n\n\nI agree with you about the perfume example. I offered out of habit, and maybe she just prefers using her own, which is totally fair. That part\u2019s clearer in hindsight.\n\n\n\nBut regarding T, sharing pain and venting is one thing (and I was listening and trying to be supportive the entire time), but the way she kept framing things was very \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t understand\u201d or \u201cyou have be resilient\u201d She even said things like \u201ccoming home to someone is a different kind of warmth,\u201d and while I get where she was coming from emotionally, it felt more like she was pointing fingers than simply sharing. I don\u2019t take my life for granted at all, nor do I ever rub it in anyone\u2019s face and even S acknowledged the next day that it felt like T was attacking me.\n\n\n\nThe 45-minute walk comment was also odd. S was present and we were both surprised by the way T said it, very accusatory, like I\u2019d somehow forced her friend to walk that far, when that wasn\u2019t the case at all. The public transport was working, just slightly delayed due to construction. Later, we learned her friend actually preferred walking for safety reasons.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve not been diagnosed with social anxiety, and I do feel much better than I used to. I\u2019m generally an overthinker and quite sensitive to dynamics, so I try to be self-aware and not jump to conclusions. That said, this whole experience has really made me question the health of these friendships, and I\u2019m trying to sort through what\u2019s real vs what\u2019s me overprocessing.\n\n\n\nThanks again for your input, it helped me ground my thoughts a bit more.",

                "body": "I think there are several things going on here. \n\nFirst, it seems that no matter what you would have tried, T had decided to just be miserable. Instead of seeing this as an opportunity to get out of her everyday life, she decided to instead see it in a negative light - and yet, she still decided to come over. This is on her and you are most definitely not a bad host.\n\nAs for S, I do wonder, however, if you're not just overthinking things. I can completely understand why someone would want to use their own perfume - something they picked out because they love the scent - over the perfume of someone else, which they very likely don't enjoy as much, just to make an example. \n\nI do think that the situation where you said you are not interested in people from your school anymore might have given them bad vibes, though. That's honestly something that would also make me go \"Ooof\" - and I am also not interested in how my old classmates are doing. However, it does give off a certain... vibe to say it like you did. \n\nI am trying to put it into words, but what I feel is sort of... a) By saying that you don't care how people from your past are doing, it is possible that the two friends felt included in that group. As in, they felt you said that you don't really care about them anymore, either. Also, b), you should have probably phrased it more like \"I am not in contact with anyone else from highschool anymore\" instead of what you said. Because the way you said it does feel... snobbish? Dismissive? Arrogant? I don't really know how to say it. At least in written form, it gives off a \"I don't give a shit about people who I don't see every day anymore, even if they maybe still care about me. Out of sight, out of mind. Fuck the past, look at the life I have now, what do I care whom I hung out with yesterday. Don't give a shit if they die of cancer, I barely remember their names anymore anyway.\"\n\nThat said, I am not surprised that you guys don't \"click\" as well anymore if you are basically long-distance friends now. You have all likely changed a lot over the years, so instead of being the girls you once were, you are now adult women, with everyone struggling with their own shit. And if you don't really hang out enough anymore to truly share your lives with each other anymore, then you don't really \"see\" what the other person has going on anymore. Much like you might not know much about your boss' personal struggles, distance can, without you wanting it to be this way, automatically change \"friends\" to \"aquaintances\", simply by all of you basing your friendship off of the \"old yous\", the teenagers from a decade ago.\n\nSo the time to let go of a friendship is when the person your friend has become isn't someone you enjoy hanging out with anymore. Staying in contact for \"old time's sake\" is not enough if you don't enjoy the women they have become. If you feel like you still love the people they are *now*, then you might want to make an attempt to communicate more in everyday life to grow closer again and be more part of each other's lives. But if that feels like a hassle or like something that won't work over the distance, then it might be time to let go, mentally thank them for being part of your life in the past and move on.",

But just to clarify, I didn\u2019t actually say I wasn\u2019t interested in people from my past or that I didn\u2019t care about them \u2014 it was more along the lines of, *\u201cI don\u2019t really follow people from school because I don\u2019t talk to them anymore.\u201d* (edited in original post) That was it. There was no judgment or bitterness behind it, just that I haven\u2019t stayed in touch and don\u2019t feel the need to keep up on Instagram with folks I\u2019ve naturally drifted apart from.\n\n\n\nAs for S, we actually do have monthly video calls and text here and there, so it didn\u2019t feel like we were reconnecting after 3\u20134 years \u2014 that\u2019s partly why this whole thing hit me harder. I thought we were closer than it ended up feeling by the end of the trip. I definitely hear your point though, and I\u2019m reflecting on how distance can shift dynamics over time \u2014 even with people we *think* we\u2019re still close to.\n\n\n\nAlso completely agree about T \u2014 it felt like she had already made up her mind about being uncomfortable or unhappy. I was really trying to make the trip fun and open-ended, but maybe she needed something else entirely.\n\n\n\nThanks again for the thoughtful insight \u2014 helped me reflect more calmly.",

                                "body": "I'm glad if I could help a bit!\n\nFor what it's worth, at least when it comes to S... I am currently experiencing a similiar situation, in a way. My best friend and I once spent every day chatting on discord (I am disabled, so meetups are difficult for me) and I knew everything about her life. She sent me pictures of her budgies, she told me what she was learning for her next exam... I truly, really was part of her life, even if we couldn't meet up.\n\nBut then, she got more and more distant. At first, it was understandable - she was done with university and now had her first job, which took a lot more time. We would still chat 2-3 times a week, with me being reasonably up-to-date, even if usually, it wasn't really \"chatting\" anymore, but more her writing one or two longer replies. She said it would get better once she was more established.\n\nWell, now I hear from her about as often as you hear from S - once a month for a bit longer and short messages here and there in between. And I can confidently say that I don't feel like part of her life anymore - and she is not part of mine. \n\nI will make an example: I hurt my foot and was looking at surgery. I told her about it - how the injections to prevent thrombosis suck, how I'm scared of surgery because of the recovery, how it sucked that my caretaker was going on vacation as all of this was going on. I told her in a big text, the day after she messaged me last. And then, three weeks later, she wrote back how sorry she was to hear this, how much this must suck for me... and then she asked how the surgery went and if the replacement caretaker was nice. Well, I hadn't had the surgery yet and the replacement caretaker was scheduled to come for the first time the day after she posted. And that's when it really hit me - that she truly, really wasn't part of my life anymore. That she knew about \"big stuff\", but the everyday things I would have told her before, about the doctor visits, about scheduling issues with the caretakers... it just wasn't there anymore. It is now not much different from me telling distant relatives how my life has been in the last year when I see them on Christmas or my birthday. \n\nBut it's the everyday things that make friends close. It's being annoyed together about the dude that made you spill your drink by bumping into you, it's about laughing at the dumb googly eyes someone drew on the traffic sign you saw on the way to work. Little things that keep you connected, not big summaries of weeks past. \n\nI actually wrote my friend now if she is even interested in staying in contact anymore since she claimed that there is no way she can write more often than once a month. I call bullshit on that since everyone can write a two-line message on the loo in the morning. We'll see if she will respond to my message in June... \n\nOverall, yes, do think about reflecting on how much you still *really* know your friend - the person she is now, in everyday life, how she reacts to small things, how different each of her days is, what little things she saw that don't appear in monthly video call summaries... and how much is your mind filling in the myriad of blanks with how you *think* she is doing based on the teenager you once saw in person far more often.\n\nIt sucks to let friendships go. But I personally came to the conclusion that I prefer letting go to pity updates once a month. With friends, I want to be closer. With aquaintances, I'm fine hearing about them less often. But that's just me, really.",

We genuinely give each other monthly updates and check in here and there. But after this visit, I\u2019ve started wondering if something has shifted and we\u2019re not acknowledging it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m actually planning on asking her directly if anything\u2019s changed on her end, or if it\u2019s just something I\u2019m perceiving. Because as much as I value what we\u2019ve had, I don\u2019t want to keep clinging to a version of the friendship that may no longer exist in the same way.\n\n\n\nIt sucks to sit with this kind of uncertainty, but your comment really helped me frame what I\u2019ve been feeling.

        "post-author": "Thou_Art_Gay",
        "text": "I (23M) have been together with my girlfriend (23F) for a little over a year now. Like any other relationships we have our own ups and downs but overall it\u2019s been great, at least for me. Ever since the start of 2025, I always had this feeling of she\u2019s just using me for money or to do things for her. I don\u2019t mind spending money on her or helping her with tasks but over the 1 year+ I don\u2019t feel like she would have done the same.\n\nCouple weeks ago I asked her a hypothetical question, \u201cif I suddenly go broke/bankrupt would you still be with me?\u201d Her answer seemed logical at first but I still felt a little hurt. She said \u201cwell if that happens I\u2019ll probably stay for maybe 3 months to see if you\u2019ll get more money again, if you don\u2019t then I\u2019ll probably leave\u201d.\n\nAnother incident happened 2 weeks ago where she went out for dinner with this guy \u201cA\u201d and 2 other male friends. I don\u2019t have anything against her seeing other old male friends as long as it isn\u2019t 1 on 1. To provide more context, my girlfriend used to have a thing for \u201cA\u201d and she told me about it before. At first when she told me about this dinner I was uncomfortable and I told her about it. But she insisted on going and hesitantly invited me to go to \u201cmake me feel better\u201d.\n\nFast forward to the day of the dinner, she only told me the general location of the restaurant and told me to wait for them. I had ot that day as work was really hectic so I arrived 10 mins late. I texted her when I arrived and asked her where should I meet them or which restaurant do I go into and waited. 30 minutes passed and still no response, I tried calling her and she never picked up. About 15 minutes later only she texted me the exact location of the place and told me to come to the restaurant.\n\nI was already pissed for waiting so long after what seemed to be a chaotic day at the office. Right after we sat down, I noticed \u201cA\u201d wasn\u2019t here yet but I didn\u2019t ask any questions. 10 minutes had passed and her phone vibrated, I could see that it\u2019s \u201cA\u201d texting her that he\u2019s here. She darted to go out of the restaurant to bring him in. I was very deeply hurt. In my head it was just this thought that \u201cwow she is okay with letting me wait for almost an hour but she sprinted out to get \u201cA\u201d?\u201d\n\nNot only that, throughout our relationship she has never once suggested activities or even showed the need/want to hangout. It was always me planning a trip, planning a date or even going out for food. Overtime I was getting more and more anxious and jealous and insecure of myself to the point where I would want to know where is she and who is she with.\n\nWe have this app called \u201clife360\u201d which tracks each other\u2019s phones and we can know each other\u2019s location in case of emergencies. We always get notifications when we leave our house and I always update her beforehand where I\u2019m going and who\u2019s going to be there so that she doesn\u2019t feel worried or anxious. But she rarely updates me and barely texts me about who she\u2019s seeing or where she\u2019s going.\n\nI\u2019ve talked about this with her before and she always dismisses it by saying \u201cwhy\u2019re you like this? You were never like this before?\u201d Or empty promises to update me more often. I\u2019m not sure what to do or what to feel anymore. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated.\n\ntl;dr: (23m) is having trouble feeling loved by the (23f) girlfriend as she has been doing \u201codd\u201d things in the relationship and now needs advice on what to do.",

        "text": "We\u2019ve been dating for over a year and a half now and I\u2019ve noticed that my boyfriend\u2019s mom has started with her comments about my family. For context there was situations in the beginning of the relationship where she told me she wanted me to get pregnant 5 months into our relationship so she could have a grandchild already. I told my boyfriend this made me uncomfortable and her told her to stop and the next time we were alone she told me \u201cyou don\u2019t have to tell your boyfriends everything you know.\u201d And after this I just kept my guard up. She would also talk down about him and say he was too needy and that his older brother (30m) was so smart and my bf was just eh. \n\n\n\nThings calmed down until I started inviting her to hangout with my aunts mom and I. She told my aunt c (55f) to find herself a married man and have an affair with him.. she then proceeded to tell the same aunt \u201cit\u2019s people like you that I don\u2019t go to church anymore\u201d. This took my aunts and mom aback because my aunt wasn\u2019t saying anything bad about her religion. She was just converting to a new religion and that set my bf\u2019s mom off. She then told my second aunt d (54f) that aunt c gained weight. Mind you they have only met 3 times. Aunt d was taken aback again and said that was peculiar to think. \n\nThen she complains to my mom that my bf calls my mom \u201cmom\u201d but I don\u2019t call her \u201cmom\u201d and why is that? My mom then had to tell her that maybe she just doesn\u2019t feel like it right now and is waiting if they ever get married. She was visibly upset about it because she brought it up again 2 other times. Then my bday happened and we ordered catering from BJ\u2019s and she told my mom \u201cyour food is so good you\u2019re a great cook\u201d and it kind weirded my mom out because she kept telling my mom that even though my mom didn\u2019t cook this day. She then mentioned it to me the next day again so weird. All of these comments are just adding up and up and I don\u2019t know what to do because my bf is the sweetest guy there is and I don\u2019t want to ruin anything.\n\nShe then came home with a dog for my bf and ever since then she\u2019s been trying to tell me where to take the dog to get shots what medicine to give him and such and not telling my bf.. ngl I didn\u2019t ever consent to wanting a dog too..  \n\nI do feel though that if we get married it\u2019s going to get worse and that\u2019s what\u2019s scaring me of commitment, I don\u2019t know what to do..\n\n**TL;DR;** my bf\u2019s mom is making rude comments about my family calling my aunt fat basically, hinting my mom doesn\u2019t know how to cook, telling me to get pregnant so she can have a grandkid already 5 months into our relationship, bought him a dog and is also telling me I\u2019m responsible for him too. I feel like it\u2019s scaring me away from him since we plan to get married and I don\u2019t know if I should confront him? ",

        "post-author": "LatteAndOneSugar",
        "text": "\nSo I\u2019m (26F) in a relationship with this guy (24M) for about 1,5 years. Let\u2019s say the beginning was perfect and then he emotionally cheated one month in but we got over it and small minor things happened but he also tried his best to regain my trust.\n\nTLDR: boyfriend sent a voicemessage to a female friend asking if she got a boo, a shawty or a dude that can call her that\u2026 read the last paragraph for more info.\n\nFast forward to now: since March we have had many fights to the point of breaking up here and there. But we would be back within days.  He would cry, I would cry (much more) and all would be well. It\u2019s very toxic but I love him very much and I do think he loves me too but now I\u2019m questioning it. The last few weeks we had some pretty big arguments where he would say hurtful things like: \u201cI don\u2019t want you\u201d and more like this. I\u2019ve became insecure again and would check his social media (I would never check his chats just is he followed someone new or if he\u2019d be looking up girls. Please don\u2019t come after me, he broke my trust a few times and he gave me this willingly to reassure me and it did help so I haven\u2019t checked in a long time until today). \n\nSo today we called and he really wanted to play a game with me for days but I had some problems installing this game so it took a few days before we got to it. Today was the day but unfortunately his wifi didn\u2019t work and he got pissed and said he would go sleep. I asked him if we couldn\u2019t spend a bit more time on call instead because we haven\u2019t played the game at all due to his connectivity issues and we only called briefly. I already feel a bit insecure lately due to his statements and the arguments and whereas before he would love to call every day, lately through the fights we didn\u2019t call as much anymore. So when I asked he blatantly told me no to which I replied that I understand he is upset he couldn\u2019t play the game due to his wifi as he was looking forward for days to playing this game with me, why would he not want to spend time with me playing a different game because we haven\u2019t called that much (and we had a big argument only two weeks ago lasting more than a week where we didn\u2019t call so I missed him). He literally hung me up midsentence. He had done this before and I find this very disrespectful. I tried calling him many times as this got me upset because he could just wish me goodnight and not try to push his frustrations with his wifi unto me? It\u2019s like he just wanted to play that game but not really spend time with me for that matter. He seemed almost annoyed with calling while earlier this day he called me very happy and was just his old self (yesterday we had another small argument..).  He literally scolded me, said some words, was very hard towards me.. while I only asked why he hung me up like that.\n\nHe went to sleep and I went on his Instagram. I saw he texted one of his girl friends that he wants to see her again at their friends house (she was an old coworker and it was never romantically or anything like it and I believe that he told me she was a lesbian). But also said: muchos love \u2764\ufe0f\nAnd this annoyed me because I know he would be upset if I would say the same to an old coworker friend. Anyhow it was more upsetting to me that he would treat me this evening like an annoyance but then ask an old coworker to hang out again..\n\nBut alas, the reason of my post is the following: I saw an earlier message thread between him and an old classmate. His last voicememo, dated 15 March 2024, literally said the following: \u201cdo you have a boo (-name of the girl-)or a shawty, or a dude that can call you a shawty, or are you to HC for it\u201d something along these lines. He said it so flirty too. Am I going crazy? This was a month after the emotional cheating occurred and three months into the relationship\u2026  I sent him many angry texts at this hour but he\u2019s still asleep so I have no clue what the next steps are. Do I just block him? Is this platonic? Would a guy in a relationship send this to a female friend? She never even responded to it.\n\n ",

        "post-author": "Professional-Rope660",
        "text": "Hi all, my boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have been together almost 5 years now. We met in university and have been graduated for about a year or so, at which points we both moved back to our hometowns. He lives with his parents, little brother (9M), and grandmother which is quite normal here for young adults (I also live with my parents). Due to the job market where we live, it's been difficult for him to find a job but he's been filling his time split between helping out with his dad's shop and taking care of his little brother.\n\nVery recently, his grandmother suddenly passed while his parents were away on a rare vacation. Because his dad was away, he was fully in charge of the store for the first time and had been there early morning until evening the past week - which is where he was when he recieved the call about his grandmother. Thankfully, someone was at the house who was able to help bring his grandmother to the nearest hospital but unfortunately, she had already passed when he got back. It was honestly a very heartbreaking and stressful day, and I had came when I heard the news from him. I grew up quite sheltered and perhaps, as a consequence, came out a bit ignorant when it came to real-world things such as this, as I've never so closely witnessed a relative's passing until now. Therefore, I had already advised him to contact our other close friends who I knew had experiences (unfortunately) with loved ones' passings, to maybe better help him work through the following legalwork, procedures, etc. while also lending a shoulder to cry on. I stayed the entire day with them all because I just wanted to support him in whatever way I could, even if I maybe didn't know how. To add, this was honestly a life-changing experience for him because not only did he experience a family member's passing, I think it was the first time he truly felt and was forced to be a 'functioning adult' in the family. For all intensive purposes, he was the sole head of his family during this ordeal. \n\nHe's been up and down emotionally and I'm trying my best to just be there for him, but sometimes I feel that he doesn't want to be seen as vulnerable in front of me. To add on, when he does get suddenly emotional, I also just never seem to be there which frustrates me so bad because it breaks my heart knowing how broken he must feel and all I really want to do is support him but I just don't know *how*. I do try to reassure him and I told him as well how proud I was seeing him take charge of the situation so effectively, checking on him personally, especially now that his family's here (long history), but he gives me nonchalant answers like \"I'm alright\" or \"Yeah, thanks for being here\". I don't want to force him to share with me, so I don't try to pry further but it's the same answer in the same neutral tone every time even when I know he's just cried some time before (his friends would tell me). I also know grief is incredibly complex and therefore, might not be a continous wave of emotions, so that also deters me from prodding further because maybe he does feel alright in the moments I ask and my asking would just be triggering something unnecesary.\n\nHis friend group, who he's had since high-school, has been a tremendous help and have been there consistently for him as well which I'm grateful for since I think they help him take his mind off things. They're quite rambunctious, but in a funny way and the dynamic between them all is a lot of jokes (which is great since it helps put a smile on his face despite everything he's faced and is facing). So, I'm really glad honestly to see him with them because at least he regains emotions even if I'm not the one making him laugh. \n\nBut, to be frank, I've really just felt helpless throughout this entire thing and I think it's starting to show. He's really good at reading me, especially when something's not right, so he's already starting to catch on that something's wrong with me. He's been asking me if everything's alright and that he's sorry for being so busy with everything, or that he's sorry if he's done something and I, of course, always tell him that there's nothing to be sorry for and to stop worrying about me, because the real problem is me. I don't feel like I've contributed anything at all where everyone else has helped in the funeral logistics, procedural advice, or just helping him take his mind off things for a moment, and it just makes me feel useless because it breaks my heart knowing the hurt and stress he's feeling and I feel helpless in supporting him. I love him so much and we have plans for a future together, but how will that look if I can't even help him now?\n\nI know this is a selfish perspective because none of this is about me but I just can't shake this overwhelming guilt. I don't want to burden him more with any of this but if I can't control it, he will for-sure confirm that something's up and it might inadvertently add to his pressures as well. Originally, I planned to just keep it all to myself but now I'm wondering if it's better to say something sooner rather than later so we can work through this quickly and get back to the real focus of the situation. At the same time, I also hate this idea because morally, I think it's wrong and again, *it's not about me*, so I should just bottle it all up and mask myself better. I don't know, maybe I'm still a little naive and young in terms of serious relationships because I can't think of any other solutions. I guess I'm just looking for advice on what to do here and moving forward because even after crying out my frustrations alone, I still feel the guilt and helplessness and it's impeding on my being there for him, which is what I really want to do. \n\nSorry that it came out so long and massive apologies if a lot of it sounded like one, big whine. I just thought it relevant to show why and how I've been feeling helpless alongside some other contexts. I'm also not a big poster so sorry if some things are not right!\n\nTL;DR My long-time boyfriend's grandmother passed away very recently and I've felt useless in being there for him as I'm not sure how to. Meanwhile, his friends and family have been a tremendous help and it makes me feel even more guilt. He's starting to catch on that something's wrong with me and now, I'm not sure if I should voice something to avoid further burden on him so that we can quickly go back to what's truly important or if this is a me problem and I should just fake it better until I resolve it myself. Is this all just a self-centred train of thought? And how can I just get back to supporting him without any worry because that's all that I really want to do. ",

                "body": "It sounds like you're just feeling insecure that you're doing enough to be a supportive girlfriend during your boyfriend's time of grief. This is new for you, so you feel like you're not doing enough which makes sense since you don't have anything to compare it to. \n\nThe reality is, we often underestimate how much just simply being present/there for someone is during a hard time. You don't have to do a song and a dance. Just showing up means a lot to most people (which you're doing). You also encouraged him to reach out to his other friends who have more experience with dealing with these things, which is also a form of support and no small thing! That was thoughtful of you, and I'm sure he appreciated even if he hasn't expressed it.\n\nEveryone has different comforting styles and ways they prefer to be comforted which is usually associated with their love languages. So, I'm not sure what your boyfriend's preferences are there, but sometimes it can help to have a direct conversation about that in order to meet his needs (or confirm whether you are or not) rather than just assuming. \n\nIt sounds like your boyfriend may also just feel emotionally drained by the time you get there, so he doesn't always delve into details with you. It's not necessarily that he's trying to shut you out or he fears you seeing that side of him (though it could be - but once again, this is an assumption without talking about it), but I can see how it could make you feel that way. \n\nIt's not selfish or whining to have your own feelings. Just because your boyfriend is grieving right now doesn't mean your feelings aren't also important and that he wouldn't want to hear how you've been feeling. You can both support and be supported. \n\nYou can tell him that you feel insecure that you're not doing enough and ask him if there's anything more he want/needs from you with all of this. Or anything else that is on your heart to share. It sounds like keeping it from him has maybe been creating anxiety in him anyway, because he thinks \\*he\\* did something wrong. So it's always better to communicate these things than to suppress them. They will eventually come out in one way or another either way. Better sooner rather than later.",

I usually see her about once a month or a bit more often, at the beach, and we had a great friendly relationship \u2014 we were genuinely open and honest with each other.\n\nAbout 4 months ago, we had a light argument about some ideas. Nothing serious, no insults or anything, just some teasing remarks \u2014 the kind I often make with other friends, really nothing major.\n\nAfter that, we continued talking like usual for about 10 more days \u2014 sharing music links or memes on Instagram, and sometimes just asking how we were doing. Then, suddenly, she just ghosted me.\n\nI only realized it about a month later when she stopped replying to my messages (yeah, I know, I\u2019m not exactly quick on the uptake). So I understood something was wrong, and I sent her an apology message \u2014 but she never replied.\n\nSome more time went by, and I noticed she had hidden her Instagram stories from me on both her accounts, without actually blocking me.\n\nI was really down about it, so I sent her a long message explaining how I was feeling \u2014 again, no response.\n\nThe last thing I did was comment under a concert post she made, asking if it was a specific stage \u2014 and she replied just with a \u201cyes.\u201d That\u2019s it. Her stories are still hidden from me, and she\u2019s not replying to any of my messages.\n\nI\u2019ve always had great relationships with my friends, and I\u2019ve always had plenty of them. I honestly don\u2019t know how to act now.\n\nMy friends, who know every detail of the story, tell me I should just leave her alone \u2014 that she was rude and disrespectful.\n\nBut I\u2019d like a second opinion from strangers, and also try to understand possible reasons for her behavior. I\u2019ll see her again in August at the beach because we have mutual friends, and I don\u2019t know whether I should talk\n\nTL;DR: A friend of mine has been ghosting me for months without a real reason. It's never happened to me before, and I just want to understand how I should handle it",

        "post-author": "throwawayKAITOfan",
        "text": "TL,DR: I don't think my boyfriend is showing me enough attention and isn't picking up any hints, and I always have to tell him everything in order for him to actually do something for me. How do I bring it up without whining/complaining too much, since we had a pretty similar conversation about the same topic not too long ago?\n\n\n\n\nI have a loving boyfriend. We've been friends for a few years before getting together, and he was so much better than my other friends at the time because we could bond over shared bad/traumatic experiences, but also general taste, opinions, thoughts and so on. \nWe got together 7 months ago, and while we had a few problems here and there, we worked through them as we promised to communicate calmly. However, I may he holding a grudge still and I'm here for opinions and advice.\n\nFor our 6 month anniversary (which I find quite special cus you know,, half a year and all), I made him a nice present and bought him a book - nothing fancy but still personal and I did put in effort. He bought me nothing. He didn't get me anything for our 5 month anniversary either, but I was fine with both as I enjoyed his company and I don't really need material things or gifts from him to feel loved, and besides, he already got me nice gifts for our first month together. But then again, is it that difficult to get/make a small thing? Or make/buy a small, spontaneous gift without me always having to ask? He's awkward and somewhat insecure, afraid of making mistakes or \"driving me away\" (despite me repeatedly telling him that I genuinely couldn't care less about what gift he gets me/makes me as long it's not something I openly hate. I love him to death). I told him how I felt hurt about some stuff and needed him to pick up hints and notice behaviours or patterns that I do when I'm, for example, upset (which are very obvious and we've discussed them thoroughly a few times, even before we got together). He apologised and said he'd try and notice more and be there for me in the future, so we soothed that out - or so I thought, I guess.\n\nI've had a urinary infection not too long ago and I've only recently recovered from it, but I got sick a few days ago (a somewhat serious cold but nothing dangerous) which is making me exhausted and irritable. I've been having check-ups and talks with the doctors at least twice a week these past few weeks because of both the urinary infection and now the cold, and not once has he offered on his own to even keep me company. Which I find hurtful.\n\nI understand that he's busy with his school and that maybe he's not in the mood to get out of the house or something, but it still hurts that he doesn't even offer help or to visit me. A few times he just outright forgot or ignored that I'm sick, until I reminded him. He hasn't gotten me anything to eat/drink when I invited him to come over (and only because it was also convenient for him, and he used to get me stuff, especially sweets and food like that before). \nBut whatever, that's fine. But he also seems.. uncaring, or disinterested. Is it really that hard to just reply to my message telling him I'm going to the hospital because I feel like shit and my health isn't improving with more than \"owww, rest up\"? Is saying something like \"I'm busy/tired/whatever today but if I could, I'd keep you company\" really that difficult, even if it's a lie? \nIt's literally the same aforementioned talk about attention and spontaneous acts of kindness (whether physical, verbal, in terms of gifts) that we had. And I'm tired of always asking things of people, especially of him. When he's sick, I make sure to buy him his favourite snacks, to cuddle with him, to offer to take care of him and try to do it should the circumstances allow. But he just doesn't return the favour despite me telling him, more than once, that I'd appreciate such things, even if just an attempt or offer. I don't get why, and if I'm just an asshole or seeking attention. I don't know how to tell him all of this without sounding like I'm whining/complaining too much. How do I tell him, what do I do? How do I communicate properly with him and let him know?\nAny help/advice is appreciated, sorry for the long ass post.\n",

                "body": "> For our 6 month anniversary (which I find quite special cus you know,, half a year and all)\n\n> He didn't get me anything for our 5 month anniversary either\n\nOut of curiosity, does he know either of these dates mean something to you? As a guy, the very concept of anniversaries is on the silly side. I can understand yearly, but even that is an arbitrary number. Is there a 6 and 3/4th month anniversary? Is there 13 month or does it switch to a yearly calendar then? What I'm getting at is while it may seem very obvious to you(and, admittedly it might be ingrained in societal norms,) he might not be giving a second thought.\n\nAs for the rest of your post: the only thing I can say is that relationships are work. They're not easy, and they're never going to be easy. It's not going to be \"we communicated this once and now we're perfect for each other;\" it's constant work. Not everyone is made for each other, sure, but I also think a lot of people are giving up way too quickly when something -anything- goes wrong. \n\nThe only thing you can do is sit him down and very seriously lay out your feelings and thoughts on the matter in a calm but firm manner. Don't do it over text, or phone, or talk to him while he's busy with something else. Sit down in a room with no distractions and be clear that you want to talk about something very serious. Say the entirity of your peace before letting him weigh in or respond. Let him know how important these things are you to if the relationship is to work in the long term; and I mean plain, straight forward language, not the \"subtle hints\" or \"I would appreciate it if you maybe did x sometimes,\" I mean CLEARLY say how important something is to you and why you're bothered by things he hasn't done recently. Think of it like hitting him over the head with a verbal brick. Don't assume your hints or feelings are obvious. Leave no room for misinterpretation. Don't worry about coming off as whiny either, this is important to you.\n\nYou also have to consider what *he's* going through and the possibility that you've missed something. Maybe he's more stressed than he lets on and is afraid to fully express himself to you.\n\nAnd, if he really never changes or puts in effort to match yours no matter how clearly you've expressed yourself, then it might not be worth it for you. The ideal relationship is both partners putting in an equal amount of effort. Some people just aren't mature enough for a long term relationship, nor do they know how good they have it until it's gone.",

Just monthly, so there would be 13 months, 15 months, etc. Again, nothing \"too special\", we just stay late (until literally the minute we got together) which is when we give each other a small gift or such, simply to sorta celebrate the fact that we're together (both of us thought we were either gonna die alone or find love very late in life lol)\n\nI know relationships are work. And I'm ready to break my back if it means I get to see this man grow old with me. He's not perfect and I'm not either - that's for sure, and I have understanding for him (really, I do - I intend to study psychology in uni and that has been my lifelong dream, so I integrated parts of my future job such as reassurance, listening and patience into my daily life and communication with others). While he has been busy with school lately, as have I, he's not really stressed or overworked, nor is there anything significant bothering or hurting him currently (which is even more of a reason as to why I'm confused). \nHe has a good memory, and is empathetic. We agree on how to manage our relationship, and I genuinely think that he just doesn't know what to do and isn't picking up \"hints\" (by hints I mean withdrawing, being quiet/dry when I'm upset/bothered, and he used to notice such switches when we were just friends. Like.. before I would be a bit less energetic and he'd immediately ask if I was okay, but now unless I directly tell him \"hey I'm not okay\", I won't get.. anything, really. And when I do say such stuff, I just get a \"oww, rest up okay? I love you\" and then once I slept whatever was hurting me off, I wake up to like 3 reels saying that I'm pretty/awesome/whatever).\n\nLong story short, I know I have to put in effort and I intend to because I genuinely want him in my life, but I just didn't know how to approach the subject (again). Thank you for the honest response! I'll try to calm down now both because I'm sick and probably not cool-headed enough to communicate properly, but by tomorrow or Thursday I'll have an update.",

        "post-author": "Fit_Beyond8156",
        "text": "I had a friend group last year. This year I wasn't in their class. I had trouble including myself in convos at lunch but tried making efforts. Once I asked to come to a party and they invented an excuse so i didnt come because they didn't want the friend I was bringing. I let that pass and then they were planning a hang out to the skating rink. I couldnt come but nobody asked me. I told them why I couldnt but they didn't care and I didn't think much of it it wasn't a big deal.\nBut then some days later I learned that one girl was saying that if I came she wouldnt come. I confronted her, and asked my closest friends about it. She told me she was here if I wanted to talk, but didn't it was late at night so she stopped responding. But she never responded to my messages after that. It hurted me but I didn't say anything. \n\nFast forward last month I learned that I wasn't invited to a big hang out because I distanced myself too much and the mean girl said that if I was coming she wouldn't come again even though i thought she would stop after talking to her about it. I talked to my closest friend, she told me to get over it (wasn't mean saying it) but I tried to communicate to understand but she would disregard a lot a my messages. About the thing the girl said she said that she couldnt ask me to hang out because some people didnt want me there, but admitted that i was progressively excluded from hang outs. Also, i asked why she wasnt telling me what was happening, she told me that i already knew everything and that i knew more than her about the story. Didn't have the chance to talk more about the subject as she wanted to stop talking about it. I thought that maybe I didn't communicate enough beforehand but I just found out texts from just a few days after learning all about the first exclusion where I complained about being excluded and that nobody was doing anything about it. My closest friend saw it but never responded. It really makes me want to just stop talking to her as we already don't talk much. But she is also the only one in the group to do efforts for my bd and stated multiple times that she didn't us to drift apart.\n \nMoreover, she complained multiples times last year that she didn't feel included in the group and I always reassured her and at least asked if she was coming to some hang outs\n \nI feel like im becoming crazy as the only mean girl in the group was the one I talked about in the beginning. My friend was a nice person so I can't help but thinking I might do a mistake cutting her of but I can't help but ressent her now\n(Sorry for my bad English)\nTL;DR : mean girl excludes me and my closest friend in the group does nothing about it.",

        "post-author": "ThrowRAbisli",
        "text": "Yesterday was my son's 7th birthday. He was at his dad's place yesterday and I just got him here today. His dad was very emotionally abusive towards me and I couldn't even call to wish him a happy birthday. I was a bit sad yesterday.\n\nBut anyway, I don't know why I was feeling so down yesterday and even crying.\n\nMy fiance I have been with for tqo years said something (nothing mean) and I started crying, I felt very emotional yesterday. He came to me and asked me so many times what is wrong. I said I don't know I just feel a little bit down but it doesnt have something to do with you. He asked again and I said I don't know, he left the room after that and has been quiet/not talking all evening until he went to bed. He still cooked (his day) and asked me to eat and kissed my foreead goodbye innthe morning today. He also didn't even mention my son's birthday yesterday. He knows the date and the importance of it to me.\n\nSo today I did apologize to him for not speaking up about how I was feeling and being distant. I told him why I was sad, I apologized for not voicing it, explained why and told him it wasn\u2019t fair to him. I see it was a pretty shitty move of me. I also got a babysitter for saturday for a concert he had been talking about so we could have some time. He said haha ok, and told me how much he suffers when he sees me unhappy.\n\nWell after that he posted a tiktok video on his whatsapp status talking about when people don\u2019t see your efforts, we were meant to celebrate my son today and I had gotten cake etc and waited for my fiance to sit with us after he had finished his shower after work. He just sat, ate his cake, starring into the table, and then went to the bedroom without a word and slept until way after my son went to bed around 9 PM. I went out bowling with my son alone after my fiance slept from 5 PM.\u00a0\n \nMind you we work the same hours, woke up the same time and I slept two hours later than him last night.\n\nWhat can I do to make it better? I feel even more unhappy now and my stomach is paining from it all. Told him how it hurts but nothing since.\n\nTl;dr: my fiance didn't understans why I was upset yesterday when I pushed him away. I apologized today and now henis pushing me away and I don't know what to do?",

Tilt your head a different way and you might see a different interpretation. \n\nOne day One wakes up. One says something, nothing inherently wrong or aggressive, and One's fiance stays crying. He asks what is wrong. Repeatedly. She assures him that it has nothing to do with him. And yet, she doesn't stop crying or being upset the entire day. \n\nShe's told One the stories about her emotionally abusive ex. One starts to wonder, \"Am I the same? Am I making the same mistakes? Am I hurting her in the same ways as her ex?\" One starts spinning out trying to figure out what he has done wrong. One tried to console her, kiss her gently on the forehead. Nothing works. It's emotionally exhausting. \n\nMove to the next day\u2014One finds out fiance was just sad she couldn't spend the day with her seven-year-old son on his birthday. Sure, it's sad. It kind of pulls at the heart strings a bit, but ... that's it? It's not like fiance didn't know her son was spending that day with his father. And it's not like she didn't have time to emotionally prepare. And it's not like it's something that she couldn't have shared out loud.\n\nOne had spent the previous day imagining the most horrible things. Was One making mistakes? Was she tired of him? Was she breaking up? Had she lost her job? Was she assaulted? Was she breaking the engagement? Was she terminally ill? All kinds of things ran through his head. And though it's sad she missed her son's birthday\u2014that's it?!\n\nNow One's feeling emotionally abused. One was put through the wringer. One had imagined she may be calling off their relationship, and now he's starting to wonder if maybe they should. \"If she goes this far over a birthday, what will it be like if she misses Christmas, or his first kiss, or any other thing she fixates on that she doesn't want to share with me?\"\n\nWhen the birthday cake is in front of One, it suddenly really pushes the point home. \"Can I keep celebrating this? This is an unhappy taste. I can't smile through this celebration. I better not ruin her son's birthday, however, with my unhappiness. Who knows how she'll react if I show any emotions to that.\" One goes to sleep from the emotional exhaustion of, \"Do I want to stay with this emotionally abusive woman?\"\n\nOP, just saying you're sad over your son doesn't dismiss the fact that you kept him away emotionally for hours. A crying woman for some men is equivalent to torture. I'd rethink my relationship with you if I were him. You wouldn't be straight and tell him, \"Sorry. It's not you. I'm sad about Junior. I just need space to grieve today. Okay?\" Voila. 3 seconds and no issues in your relationship.",

        "text": "My boyfriend [26M] and I [25F] have been together for 3 and a half years. We are both from California and met in college. We moved together during his last semester. That\u2019s when I also started working in my field. It\u2019s a healthcare related career. After our lease ended and he graduated, he had a job lined up in Texas. I decided to live with my parents and he decided to move and take the job in Texas. I understand that he had to do what is best for him. We wanted to maintain our relationship. I continued working in California and living with my parents, though it started to become difficult for us to do long distance. I decided to move to Texas to be with him. I found a new job out there and started grad school too. My program was a year and a half and it is coming to an end. I initially thought moving to Texas may make him consider if he wanted to be with me long term or not. Before moving, I made it very clear of what I want for my future in a relationship and my reasons for moving out there. He knew I want to be engaged sooner rather than later, especially moving for our relationship. He agreed and we seemed to be on the same page. \nFast forward to today, we are not engaged/ at the point in our relationship that I had hoped/ want us to be. I\u2019m about to graduate, but I want to pursue my career in California rather than Texas. For my field, California has better opportunities and I would need a license in each state I practice in. Getting a license in CA would be a long/difficult process if I stay in TX. My boyfriend wants to stay in TX for at least another year for his job\u2019s vesting period before looking for a new job. He is open to moving back to CA after that. He had told me he will propose within the next year and that I should trust him. I was sad and upset that he still never proposed to me after all this time. A part of me doesn\u2019t know for sure if he will actually purpose in the timeframe he mentioned. I\u2019m contemplating moving back to California to focus on myself and give him more to think about what he wants. Or should I stay in TX and get the license for my career here in hopes that he will propose soon and in hopes that we will eventually move back to California?\n\n\nTLDR/ tl;dr : My boyfriend hasn\u2019t proposed to me in the timeframe I had imagined after moving to a new state for the relationship. Should I stay or leave?",

If you prefer CA, move back and pursue the opportunities here. If he truly loves you and honestly has intention to move back and propose, then that will happen.",

Seems like yall are going thru a lot of transitions and that\u2019s exciting, but expecting a marriage proposal seems a little futile since it\u2019s not up to you when he decides to make that choice. Kinda feel like if he\u2019s was going to propose he would\u2019ve done it already? My advice is to chase your dreams, wait for no man, and focus on thriving with or without him.",

        "text": "I'm in a great relationship except I think my BF is looking for validation from other women. Should I try to work through it with him?\n\nI've been in a great relationship for 3 months--really really good. But I've caught my BF chatting with other women. The first time, with a high school friend who he swears is just an old friend and needed relationship advice. He showed me a couple of innocuous texts. Then I noticed he had sent her a picture of himself. Which upset me, so I asked to read the rest of the messages. He said no and got super defensive and immediately deleted the app and messages. He said he had shared things about his mental health that he didn't want me to read, and that's all. He knows I have severe trust issues because my last BF was a serial cheater, so after lots of back and forth, he said he'd ask her to send him screenshots of their conversation. Which was more than 2 weeks ago.\n\nHe's been guarding his phone ever since, which makes me even more suspicious. I asked to look at it, since he told me early on that I could, but now he has changed his mind. He says it is a boundary issue and not that he has anything to hide. However, yesterday, after I asked him again about the screenshots and he said he was still working on it (again), he relented and let me look at some of his pictures. When I opened his photos I saw screenshots of of texts he had with his ex-gf--he immediately grabbed the phone and deleted them even though they were fairly innocuous. But what freaked me out was when I opened his Reddit app and saw that he had begun chatting with a woman. Nothing romantic had been exchanged. He said he was lonely and looking for friends. I asked to read more and he immediately deleted his account.\n\nHe continues to swear that there isn't anything to see or hide, and he even tried to recover the Reddit account. So maybe he just needs to feel some validation? I really don't think he has done anything in person, but I know he isn't being completely honest with me either. He swears I am the only woman and regrets responding to the woman's introduction on Reddit. He acknowledges that he caused this and wants to fix it, if I'll give him another chance.\n\nTL;DR? I'm in a great relationship except I think my BF is looking for validation from other women. Should I try to work through it with him?",

If he thinks these are friendly, then there is no need for all the grabbing and deleting. He should just be able to say \"I expect you to trust me to make and maintain friendships with women.

We argue a lot but we resolve it afterwards. But lately, it's been really hard since it's about boys. He's been pretty clear that I shouldn't be too close because he said that I dont have any spacial awareness and I can be too physically close to them. Me and him are classmates so he sees what I'm doing with the others.\n\nHere is an example scenario: We're having a group activity and I'm the leader so I gotta talk to everyone fast because we only have 5 minutes. My bf was upset and said when I talk to my groupmates that are boys I'm so close to them like I have no personal space at all. I explained that I am that way since the beginning and I was just talking to them in a rush but that's not working. \n\nMy bf said when I have a problem he'll change immediately without a doubt. That made me feel guilty so I said I'll change but he said it can't happen again otherwise it's gameover. We had a big argument about this and he said hurtful words. \n\nFor me, it's really hard because I really couldn't control how I act or talk especially when I'm in a rush. I really love him and want to work things out with him but I feel scared because what if I accidentally forgot. I requested for him to have more patience but he said changing is pointless if I forget. \n\n\nSo, should I do what he said or is he making things complicated?\n\nTL;DR\nI don't have spacial awareness and my boyfriend has a huge problem with that.

In the real world you will still have to talk to other guys for work, clerks/tellers at a bank or store and at drive thru windows. Will he throw a hissy fit over that too? Expect you to live in a box only he can open? \n\nHe sounds insecure and controlling. Definitely overreacting.",

Now how he speaks to her yes that should change but there are truths on both sides. Sure many here agree with you and you all are incredibly wrong to just write off his feelings as invalid so it really just speaks to how successful you all are in relationships and what types of boundaries you guys have in yours. Assuming you all are in one if that. Differentiating how close you are with your partner compared to friends sounds like it\u2019s a boundary correct me if i\u2019m wrong.. Let me know what the healthy part is of dismissing those boundaries outright. None of you who dismiss one side completely are qualified to give advice and it scares me that you call a 17 year old boy controlling and insecure as if he\u2019s a grown adult. 17 year olds don\u2019t know how to communicate let alone take valid advice from bitter women on the internet. It seems to me that you all are pushing this narrative that any amount of control is insecurity and leads to abuse or getting beat. Giving advice on getting beat is significantly different from what is being described here. So I suggest you, as well others, to keep these biased views of  \u201che shouldn\u2019t control you in any way\u201d \u201che\u2019s insecure\u201d out of the youth. That\u2019s a poor excuse of saying feel free to do whatever you want. Either all of you are in carefree open relationships where the guy doesn\u2019t care about you or are wusses, or you all want excuses to not be confined in any way which is not how every girl wants to be as she\u2019s still learning.",

But feelings are not based in logic and therefore are not always rational. Almost always when someone tries to immediately curb that behaviour in someone else (male or female) it comes from a place of trying to control them. If ones insecurities or ideals cause them to feel some type of way on the matter, in a healthy dynamic they don't gaslight their partner into thinking the partner is wrong for doing so. But thats what this 17y/o boy did. He could have just said hey I don't think we're compatible, or hey this makes me feel uncomfortable can we figure out a compromise. But no. He gaslit her into thinking its a fault with her and demanded she change. Whether he knows what it is or not, it doesnt change that its gaslighting. May he grow out of it? Possible. But that doesnt change that it IS gaslight, and controlling, and OP should not accept that behaviour on any level. \n\nSome are ignorant due to only having positive relationships. Others are ignorant because while they've maybe had bad expierences, they weren't dangerously bad. You make it seem like he has no control. He does. Or at least could. And he needs a wake up call. Cos hes on a dangerous path. Plenty of teen boys don't do what hes doing. So that shows its something more than just being a 17y/o male.  \n\nDue to so many reasons, I have feelings that don't have space in a healthy relationship because they are unhealthy. That is solely a me problem and my partner should absolutely not just 'accept' them for any reason.",

So I at least somewhat understand your perspective.\n\nWhen we started dating he really didn't like me being physically close to males, we discussed it thoroughly and came to the conclusion that he was uncomfortable with it, because he does not trust males that are strangers. Which lead to the next conclusion that if I am comfortable being that close with my friends (male or female), he should trust my judgement and respect my choice to be close with friends. Also because he did decide he trusts I do only have eyes for him and platonic physical closeness was not a threat to our relationship at all. \n\nThis is a conversation we were able to have at 17, which lead to mature resolutions. I will also tell you that if he had decided to not trust me for one reason or another or could not get comfortable with it, I would have probably ended the relationship due to incompatibility. \n\nI would also like you to consider something that I did not yet know at that time. Love is built over time, love is boring and slow, but also steady, reassuring and safe. What most people experience in the beginning is infatuation, which can be lovely, but it has more ups and downs, is fast and fluctuates. There's nothing wrong with that and you can use it as a foundation to build love on, but they are not the same. I am saying this, because it's like the difference in renting an item vs having bought it. You still have time to decide whether it's right for you, or if you are just not compatible and need something else.",

        "text": "For context, we are both 18 and have been dating for almost 2 years. \n\nWhenever I try to bring up an issue I have with our relationship, my girlfriend gets defensive and questions why I have an issue with something rather than validating my feelings.\n\nFor example, we were hanging out with some friends, and she was talking with some of her friends and making jokes about getting each other pregnant, and eventually they began to joke about cheating on me. I knew it was just a joke, but it made me incomfortable anyways. \n\nI decided to bring this up to my girlfriend by saying the jokes they were saying hurt and made me uncomfortable. She went on to say that she thought it was obvious that it was just a joke, and she didn't understand why it was such a big deal. She also said that she wishes she didn't have to worry about what she says all the time because of how I feel.\n\nMy issue is not necessarily the jokes, it's the fact that she chooses to defend why something she does is okay even if I have a problem with it.\n\nIf she told me that I was doing something that was bothering her, I would stop it because I prioritize her feelings and I'm willing to make sacrifices like that for her. \n\nI do NOT want to break up with her. There are too many beautiful parts of our relationship that are worth this struggle. If anyone has any advice on how to approach this, or any advice on how to feel at all it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTL;DR \nGirlfriend gets defensive when I bring up issues and I don't know how to deal with it",

                "body": "Since you don't want to break up with her, my best advice is for you to bring it up in the moment. It sounds like you let her make the joke and then approach her at a later time to ask her to stop, but that's not working. So next time she makes a joke about cheating on you in front of other people, say \"Hey, that's messed up. Don't joke about cheating on me.\"\n\nIt is extremely likely that you calling her out in front of her friends will not go well. Her friends are likely to take her side. They'll say \"it was just a joke!\" and you'll have to say \"well, that kind of joke isn't funny to me, please stop making it.\" Your girlfriend will accuse you of being humorless and ruining her good time with her friends. You'll probably end up leaving the gathering early. \n\nThe goal of this strategy is to make telling these jokes uncomfortable for her, and ideally for her friends as well. She has been very clear that she doesn't care enough about **you** being hurt or uncomfortable enough to change her behavior. You have to make her and her friends as uncomfortable as they are making you - uncomfortable enough that they decide to stop telling those jokes around you. \n\nOr you could just break up and date someone who doesn't make jokes about cheating on you, and/or who cares about your feelings.",

        "post-author": "iwantoutofhereee",
        "text": "Throwaway bc I don\u2019t want family to find this. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of necessary backstory so bear with me. TLDR at the bottom. \n\nI (34F) and my husband (35m) have two daughters (1.5, 3mo). We are currently living in my childhood home with my dad (78m) and my sister (32F). We decided to move in when we were expecting my first daughter which was soon after my mom passed away. It is a huge help for us financially to be here as I am a SAHM now and our previous apartment would have been very tough to afford on one income and it also was not going to be a good environment for babies. We do not formally pay rent but we cover almost all food costs for everyone, I cook meals, and my husband and I have taken over some of the tasks around the house that are getting too difficult for my dad to do. Everyone in the house is happy with this arrangement. A big factor in us moving in was also the fact that my mom had passed and we wanted more family to be around my dad. He has no friends (by choice) and even with my sister around (she works a lot and is not often home) we all didn\u2019t feel comfortable with how much alone time he would have. My mom was his life and we didn\u2019t know what he would do with his time moving forward and he also needs more looking after due to his old age. When I brought up the idea of my family moving in to my dad, he said he had been planning on extending the invitation for us to come live there so it was a mutual decision. \n\nA couple months after my mom passed away, my older half brother (53 M - same dad) with whom I had a previously positive but distant relationship with, started making comments to my sister about how my husband and I were freeloaders by moving into the house and taking up so much space. My brother has never lived in this house and I was obviously hurt when my sister told me about these comments because I felt it wasn\u2019t true about our situation but also it isn\u2019t his business. At this point we hadn\u2019t moved in yet but the plans were pretty much set. My brother never said anything to me about it but my sister showed me texts he sent her that were really negative and strongly worded. I mentioned this to my dad and his response was that it wasn\u2019t my brother\u2019s business and that he wanted my family to come move in. I tried to let the comments go and we moved on. \n\nFast forward a year and a half later to now. Over the last year and a half, my brother has made some other comments to me disguised as jokes that I haven\u2019t appreciated. It\u2019s obvious to me that he looks down on me and doesn\u2019t like me very much, which I hadn\u2019t ever felt before the whole housing situation. Pretty suddenly a few months ago, he reached out saying that he felt tension and didn\u2019t know why and wanted to talk about it in person, just the two of us. I met up with him and that conversation was basically a two hour monologue of him saying how unwanted he felt by the family because of things my mom did and said before I was born. Of course I don\u2019t know what actually happened but when I told my dad this, he said none of those things were true. Keep in mind all of this is very upsetting to hear considering my mom has recently passed away and my brother\u2019s mom is still alive. In the same conversation he said that he wanted us to be closer and basically insinuated that the reason we haven\u2019t been closer in the past was my mom keeping us apart (not true based on what I saw growing up). \n\nWe recently met again to have another conversation at his request and I basically said I didn\u2019t know what would be possible for us in terms of a closer relationship because of what he said about me and my husband concerning us moving in. He very quickly said he was just making sure my dad was happy with the arrangement and that he said nothing negative and blamed my sister for spinning it into a negative story. He said he felt used by my sister and it was clearly her fault for putting thoughts in my head. After the conversation I talked to my sister who showed me the texts again and it\u2019s clear my brother is lying. He had been saying again and again how honesty was important and we were all going to have to be truthful to have a good relationship moving forward so the lies hurt even more because of that. I had been wondering why he wasn\u2019t reaching out to my sister about having a closer relationship and without me asking, he said it\u2019s because I have kids and he wants to be a present uncle. I get that but it also made me feel like the means to an end. \n\nI have decided to explicitly say I can\u2019t have a close relationship with him for the above reasons, as well as various smaller boundaries that have been crossed. I have a text drafted and I\u2019m going to include screenshots of his texts as proof that he lied to me. Based on what he has expressed, I need to be explicit about this and can\u2019t just distance myself because he said he will keep pushing to be involved. \n\nNow the issue is when I should do it. His son (who I don\u2019t have a relationship with and he blames me and my late mom for that) is graduating from college and we\u2019ve all been invited to the ceremony and a party in a month. Up until now I had been planning on going because I knew it was important to my brother. I think my nephew could probably care less if I were there or not. The main reason I don\u2019t know about just not going is that my dad\u2019s ex (brothers mom) will be there and my dad has absolutely no desire to see her or interact with her. Based on what I know about her I don\u2019t blame him. It\u2019s important that he goes to this event snd I don\u2019t want to leave him high and dry with her there and I don\u2019t know if just my sister will be enough of a buffer. My dad wants to stay out of this drama between my brother and I and won\u2019t really comment on it and I know if I ask him what he thinks I should do about going to graduation, he will not give a real answer and just will want to avoid having to deal with it. \n\nTLDR; I have decided to tell a family member we can\u2019t have a close relationship but he is hosting an important family function. Do I tell him and not go or wait until after the function to say something? I don\u2019t want to be two-faced but also don\u2019t want to cause more family drama and tension. \n\n",

We grew up together and had a relationship for three years before I broke up with him because he had wandering eyes and started to seem just not crazy interested in me, not that he ever treated me bad but he was just immature I think and also wasn\u2019t very honest about how he felt or about things in general. Flash forward 5 years later and we have now been talking for 8 months. To my surprise I actually really like him and think he\u2019s incredibly funny. He treats me so well that the first time I ever saw him he gifted me a really expensive thing telling me how he remembered I wanted it. He does really nice things for me, I have never needed to lift a finger around him, he plans trips, he tells me how much I mean to him, takes me shopping, never complains, etc. I also have yet to catch him in a lie but I have trauma from catching him in the past in lies so I don\u2019t even look at his phone or anything anymore nor do I want to. Anyways even with this new leaf he\u2019s turned I don\u2019t know how I feel. \nHe wants to ask me to be his girlfriend and some days or even weeks I\u2019ll feel so good about that but then other times I get anxious thinking about it. When I see him sometimes I feel intense anxiety but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s about him or relationships or life. For background I struggle with commiting to anyone and I think this is from a lack of a loving home in my childhood. I experienced a bit of trauma growing up so I don\u2019t love like a normal person would. I don\u2019t really like affection. Not that I can\u2019t show it but I just struggle with it. I\u2019m also not sure if I\u2019m attracted to him physically tho I am definitely attracted to him somewhat, I am more attracted to his personality. \n\nI also hate the dating field as I\u2019ve been with multiple other people both long term and short but have never actually dated anyone other than him. \nWe also have different career paths and could end up in completely different states tho I know this isn\u2019t the worst thing it still worries me.\nHe is so great and I love him a ton but I don\u2019t know why my brain is struggling. He\u2019d drop anything for me and I wanna do the same but I\u2019m panicking. He\u2019s my best friend and it\u2019s been like that for years. I just don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nTL;DR;: great guy with a complicated past, anxiety about the situation, should I stay and work it out or go",

We *all* did stupid stuff when we were 20.  \n\nIf we tried to base our mid-twenties and later relationships on what a potential partner did when s/he was a *teen*...pretty much no one would measure up and we'd all just have to stay single forever.\n\n> he had wandering eyes and started to seem just not crazy interested in me\n\nIt sounds as if there was never any malice there, he never set *out* to try to hurt you.

I said \"or at least until you start on the road to healing,\" as in at least until you've figured out how to handle your avoidant tendencies and learned how to recognize when you're feeling anxious and overthinking because of your past and unhealed trauma vs when there's a legitimate reason to be feeling like something isn't right.\n\n>Idk i like to think it\u2019s better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all.\n\nI agree, but again, there's a difference between a relationship ending naturally because you both realize you're not right for each other (or whatever other reason) vs it ending because you get cold feet and give in to your instinct to run away fueled by your inability to commit and your avoidant attachment.\n\nAgain, I wasn't trying to say you need to be \"fully healed\" (I mean we're all fucked up, if we all waited to be fully healed before dating then no one would be with anyone), just that you should at least be far enough along in your healing journey that you have control over yourself and your attachment style/trauma rather than it having control over you and your relationships constantly being at risk of being sabotaged from it.\n\nIf you're there then great, I wish you the best of luck.",

I\u2019ve made dumb decisions before and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll make more in the future. I\u2019m working on that.\n\nYeah I feel you, it's especially tough when you're young as you're still kinda trying to figure out who you are as a person and so much can change so quickly at your age. You will *definitely* continue to make dumb decisions (no shade to you, that's just getting older lol, we all do stupid shit), but that's just part of growing up and learning. But as long as you continue to do your best and always learn something from your mistakes then that's all you can really hope for.\n\n>Compared to all my past relationships my love for him doesn\u2019t even touch the scale, and I think that scares me the most. Because if it\u2019s not him idk who it could be, he\u2019s been there for me through everything and after 10 years I still feel like he\u2019s the most significant person to ever step into my life.\n\nWell there's a lot to unpack here and a couple possibilities.\n\nI'm not sure if your other past relationships were unhealthy (I know you said he cheated on you, but I'm not sure about any other relationships/situationships where you were in love), but you might have been more drawn to them because it sounds like you grew up with an unhealthy idea of what love looks like and we tend to try and repeat our patterns and go for what feels familiar, even if it's not what's best for us. So this might just be a more peaceful, calm kind of love, but because it's not full of the difficulties you're used to you feel like it's not as deep.\n\nIt could also just be that while you do love him you're just, for one reason or another, not that into him, and that's okay. Sometimes even though someone checks all the boxes on paper it just doesn't translate to the real world and you're just not feeling it. As long as those reasons don't have anything to do with the aforementioned possibility (not being enough drama so you think it's not as deep, etc.) then it's a shame but it kinda is what it is.\n\nOR it could be as simple as the fact that he cheated in the past so you just don't feel you can trust him anymore, which is totally valid.\n\nRegardless of what it is though, the last thing you want to do is settle because it feels like you *should* want to be with him. That's doing yourself and him a massive disservice, as you both deserve to be with someone who is actively wanting to be with you.\n\nAs far as not knowing who it could be, well I mean that's sort of the beauty of life and love, as no one knows who that person will be. But just because he's been a significant person in your life and helped you through things, etc. doesn't mean that he's in your life to be your person. Maybe he was just in your life to show you what you won't put up with and what qualities you want in a man, and to help you through some stuff and that's it, who knows. But again, you're young, you've got plenty of time to find someone and if you keep an open heart, keep healing, and all that, then you definitely will.",

I value the lessons that come with all my experiences though 100%.\n\nAll three scenarios have played in my head the past 8 months being with him. They quite literally rotate like clockwork. He\u2019s never actually cheated (unless we count with his eyes and search history) but he did lie like it was the easiest thing on the planet\u2026but he was also 18. That stuck with me for many years and even now. Fs hard to get past but time will tell! He\u2019s a genuine person now and as long as it stays like that I don\u2019t doubt I could look past it. \n\nAs for the uneasiness of healthy relationships, YUP. Without the drama and the toxic yearning I feel distant, like somethings missing or wrong. Like his masculinity is questionable. If I let myself I\u2019d get married to an asshole who didn\u2019t care about me in two days and be \u201chappy\u201d about it (so so so miserable but \u201chappy\u201d) if that makes sense. Peace almost annoys me but for the sake of my sanity and for my future family I\u2019m doing the work to get out of that cycle. He is so kind and \u201cgolden retriever\u201d like that it makes my nervous system curl in the best way possible haha. I love him and hate the way his love makes me feel but in the most secure way possible. \n\nI feel so weird for admitting that but I honestly feel like it\u2019s not talked about enough. Not proud of it but doing my best to unlearn a lot of things in my life. Overall I have hope that once I figure out if this is for me or not, through time or experience and healthy communication, I will make the best decision for the both of us here.\n\nThanks for advice tho!

        "post-author": "hobbesboiler",
        "text": "\nHi everyone, I wanted to get some advice on how to not engage with my friend when she starts acting this way. \n\nI\u2019ve been friends with a girl for about 5 years now. We are very close and I consider her one of my best friends. However, one of her biggest flaws is that she always needs the attention to be on her in a group setting. She\u2019s great one-on-one, we have fun together and have supported each other through our roughest times. But when she gets around large groups, I cannot stand her. She\u2019ll very obviously flirt with men and then be shocked when they start to like her. She blatantly flirted with my ex in front of me (not because she likes him but because his attention was on me and she would do anything for it to be on herself) but she\u2019ll do these things in a strategically subtle way where if someone points it out they\u2019ll look the crazy one. \n\nThe worst thing for me about this is birthdays. We went to dinner for my birthday last year and she had recently broken up with her boyfriend. She told me the story earlier that day, and she didn\u2019t seem sad at all about it, at least outwardly.  At dinner, she decided to spill the news about the breakup to the rest of the group, and spent basically the whole dinner talking in detail about the story. I left feeling really unappreciated but didn\u2019t say anything because I wanted to be there for her. Last week was another one of my friends\u2019 birthday and we went to dinner. She had been apartment hunting for a while and recently found a suitable apartment to move into. Again, she told me this earlier in the day and she showed me the virtual tour and talked in detail about the location, looked at it on Google earth, etc. But then at dinner, she decided to drop the news that she found a new apartment to the group and everyone asked to see it and she ended up giving everyone the virtual tour again on her phone, until we got our food which was about 45 mins. Meanwhile it seemed like no one was paying any attention to the birthday girl. I tried diverting the topic to ask the birthday girl something and my friend always found a way to bring the conversation back herself. The frustrating part is that I feel like I\u2019m the only one who sees it happening - everyone else indulges in her behavior. \n\nWell, my birthday is coming up next week and we are all going to dinner. She will just have gotten back from a big trip to a national park. I have been feeling kind of down and unappreciated lately and I am just afraid that my entire birthday dinner is going to revolve solely around her trip, and everyone will want to hear all about her trip and it won\u2019t even feel like a birthday dinner. I want to know how I can handle this - is there a way that I can not indulge in her story to make her tell it faster or for it to not be the main topic of conversation? Any tips on how to handle this?\n\nTLDR: My friend has a habit of always redirecting a conversation back to herself and her life, particularly on days centered around other people, like birthdays. How do I prevent this on my upcoming birthday?",

                "body": "It's quite possible to redirect the conversation, but you need some good social skills and I'd recommend you do it in a friendly way. You can definitely stand to hear about her life for a few minutes, but prepare several conversation topic redirectors.\n\n-\"your trip sounds really cool. I am actually taking a trip for my birthday soon!\" [Begin talking about your trip]\n\n-\"i have a birthday activity planned I'd love for everyone to participate in! Let's [play game, do activity]\"\n\n-\" that's exciting. I think [mutual friend] is also planning on a trip soon. [Mutual friend], tell us about your trip?\"\n\nIf she is truly so self centered that she keeps talking about herself, simply start another conversation to the side if you can. Don't encourage questions to her.\n\nOften, these people are good talkers but not great at asking questions. Overcoming this requires you to be a good talker as well, or ask questions of another good talker.\n\nAlso-- tell her! The next time she does this, let her know you noticed what just happened. \"Hey friend. I tried talking about me just now, and instead of engaging with it you started talking about your life again. I love hearing about your life, but we just did that for an hour. It hurts my feelings to know you don't tend to ask me questions or spend a lot of time listening to me talk. When that happens I feel like you don't care about me. Can you make an effort to be a more active listener in our conversations?\" She may have no idea she does this and want to improve.\n\nAlso-- you never HAVE to be friends with someone. You can begin to distance if it seems she'll never change.",

OP, this, right here, is terrible on her part. Reading the rest of your post, it's clear that she needs all attention and everything to be about HER. IMO this is not a healthy friendship that's loving or fair. Based on the quote above alone, she's manipulative and calculating - the fact that she commandeers every conversation and every group setting ... serious questions now that I believe you must ask yourself:\n\nYou may be a friend to her, but is she really a friend to YOU?  \nDoes she respect you?  \nWhy does she believe that what's happening in her life is more important than what's happening in yours (and is that really acceptable to you)?  \nWhy would she blatantly flirt with your Ex when she knew it would be pouring salt into a a painful wound for you?  \nI guess the material point is: Do you believe she treats you with nurturing support, kindness and respect as a friend should?\n\nIf you can answer these questions and still see her in a positive light, your resentment is probably about something else in your life. BUT reading your post makes me feel very upset on your behalf. She seems to be consistently self-absorbed, attention-seeking and dismissive of you as a person, as well as the others in your friend-group. IMO your resentment is warranted, and I'd rethink your friendship with this selfish waste of time/energy. I'm not sure your question about preventing her bad behavior makes sense to me, because she's established a trackable pattern over 5 years that confirms her lack of respect for you or your feelings. Why do you allow her to remain your friend or invite her to something she's almost surely going to ruin? But most importantly, think about the last sentence of your post - You can't and shouldn't have to control someone you care about. The fact that she creates this dilemma for you by even being present on your special day already gives you your answer. She's not a true friend if this is a constant worry, every single year and apparently every time you get together with her. Perhaps rethink maintaining this particular friendship/off-kilter-relationship?\n\nI wish you a beautiful birthday, and hope you can feel celebrated (as you deserve)!",

        "text": "Hi friends )\n\nI apologize for my rough English, it is not my first language.\n\nSo, my girlfriend and I are both international students from Slovakia. We get along pretty great and have lots in common, but one main difference is that I feel at home here, while she still feels like her home is back there. I believe that over the years I have grown accustomed to this culture, its language, its food, and its sports (go Cubs!) but not she.\n\nThat would be fine but there's more. Due to her feeling that way, she travels home constantly. She spends one, two, or even three months with her family back home. While I do miss my parents, my brother and I understand they made a huge effort sending us to study abroad, so we don't really feel the need to go back. We owe it to them to make a life here. Parents feel the same way.\n\nI told her before that I can't handle long distance, she said she understood. But now it's been almost a year of us being together but she going home for months, sometimes I feel like we are not together anymore. Makes it seem she didn't care about respecting my limits. Makes me confused. But on the other hand, I don't want to say to her to not go home, that would be rude and controlling, she is a great girl and I wouldn't want to make her sad.\n\nI just fear things will not be the same when she gets back. That we will have grown apart too much, due to pretty much being out of each other's lives for 1/4 of a year. She thinks we should try a different approach this time, so we don't grow apart, like videochatting more often, but I don't think that will change much. She's either here or she's not. And when she's not, I feel like the only one that is sad.\n\nTLDR: Girlfriend often goes home for months. I have told her I can\u2019t do long distance but she still leaves. I feel like we\u2019re drifting apart. I am frustrated that this seems so much easier for her, makes me think she is not as interested in our relationship as I.",

She is back in the place she loves, with her family. Presumably she doesn't really have a job during these trips. Whenever she feels down about you not being there she's got other loved ones to hang out with, fun things to do. It would be ideal if she'd show a bit more sympathy or express wishing you were there.... but I wouldn't expect her to feel particularly *sad*, when these trips are clearly so positive and valuable for her.\u00a0\n\n\nMeanwhile, no matter how much you feel at home in your new country, you're still far away from your family. Presumably you're working or studying. Chicago is grey as hell. (I mean, i don't think Slovakia's climate is sunshine and rainbows, but I think loneliness and grey weather multiply each other.) Being alone will hit a lot harder for you.\n\n\n\nBut it sounds like staying in Chicago is your choice. Traveling back is her choice. If this arrangement isn't working for you, then it's an incompatibility to end things over. You won't get her to stop traveling home when it's clearly the most important thing for her.",

A friend once told us that I am \"hoping the present still matters\" while she is \"hoping the future is flexible\" I screenshotted his message haha so it was easy to find.

We keep coming up with this issue where I feel like I am the one to complain/nag about everything in the relationship bc I\u2019m brutally honest, communicative, and impulsive w my emotions/thoughts. Sometimes I hold it in to process, but at times he asks me what\u2019s wrong and I say it. On his hand, he gets anxiety or a deep fear that if he communicates how he feels/thinks then I will break up with him or judge him. He is emotionally closed off in most situations.. and has lied to me to \u201cprotect me\u201d or how I feel. This leads to us having emotional outbursts and very overwhelming conversations or arguments bc he waits until last minute to tell me how he feels. I have acknowledged and apologized for the things I\u2019ve said but it\u2019s not good enough. I just want to be better for him. \n\nTl;dr how can I make my boyfriend feel more comfortable and vulnerably open about his emotions?",

He used to Snapchat a girl that he is friends with in the beginning of our relationship but has since deleted Snapchat. He also wore a bracelet that she made him for the first couple months of our relationship but he says he used to have tons of friendship bracelets from different friends and they have all since fallen off.\n\n\nTonight I asked about this friend because I haven't seen a message from her in months. He told me that he heard from her a few weeks ago on Instagram but deleted the message because \"he knew I would freak out\". I am more upset that he deleted the message than that they were even messaging. Now I'm wondering what else he has deleted and why he felt the need to delete it if it was genuinely just a friendly check in.\n\nTldr: boyfriend deleted messages and didn't tell me",

Did his family think you were just best mates, and then found out? Did you annoy them in some way? Did your parents talk to his parents? What was his reaction to not being able to have you over any more? Was he on put out as you, or did he not seem fussed by the change?\n\nI think you need to work on the answers to those questions before working out next steps.\n\nIf it\u2019s purely \u2018can\u2019t be at each other\u2019s homes and it\u2019s cold outside\u2019, do you have income?

She said felt guilty but didn\u2019t told me, she has been talking to the guy till now on instagram, cause they are on the same band.\n\nBtw this talk was on a discord call, I was to shocked so I talk normally, asked stuff but do you still talk to him? do you like him?(she said no) She said she still loves me and this all was a mistake and she did something stupid.\n\nThe thing hard for me to understand is why she do it, why did she told me 8 months after and why does she still talks with him\u2026\n\nShe cried a lot I stayed broken inside, this is hell Im lost i talked to friends, i could understand maybe the kiss thing if she called me after on the same day, this happened, but she kept a secret and talked with the guy on instagram.\n\nI really like her, i buy her flowers a lot, make her pancakes with strawberries in the morning, i always try to find a game or a board game for us, movie night, etc On this last months that we weren\u2019t together that often, Sometimes she would cry when i would hug her while sleeping and take my hand off, but most of the times i assumed it was bad mood.\n\nI also asked her to remove the guy from her life, social media and for her to give me time \n\nhope anyone can give guidance.\n\nTl;dr: Gf wants me to give her a second chance after she confessed today that she kissed a guy 8 months ago on a philarmonic band party and still talks with him after 8 months.\n",

Or when your relationship inevitably runs into more challenges? Will you be able to trust her to not make another \u2018mistake\u2019? Do you believe she will be honest?

He lives in Europe and I live in Asia.\nOnce a day out of blue he told me \"someday we might not work anymore when we choose to go live another country\" you might wanna work in Usa and If I work in UK. then it will be hard for us to keep this relationship.\nOf course we should try our best, but don't blame me pls when this happens. So I asked him then what if I live in your country after I graduate? and he told me l'd be obviously happier when you come here sooner but don't dare to choose to do just bc of me. cause l'm not a perfect person and I can hurt you someday I don't wanna do that. And your life is yours so I cannot suggest anything about your life and your career bc my parents taught me that way. I always have been taught that big decision in your life is yours. and that's why I cannot suggest you anything but I might change my mind someday and pressure you to come here when I feel confident\n\n\n\n\nSo basically he don't want commit anything to me. but for now obviously want to keep this relationships even deciding to coming here during his holidays. His entire words just makes me so confused. basically he is almost my first love and l've always drawn our future and dedicated to him always learning english so I can communicate with him better. And he is now telling me nothing clear about our future just avoiding any of his responsibility. Although I told him I'll try my best caring texting you and we can do it He replied me kinda overly pessimistic and realistic about our future relationship .\nAnd I feel I'm loosing feeling over him cause I found myself cannot trust him anymore and dream us together in the future.. but I still love him so much caring him so much and we're meeting end of June to spend holiday together in other asian country. What should I do in this case...?? should I tell him about my feeling before our holidays? or after that? I don't even get clue or anything about this relationship\n\nTL;DR : My bf don\u2019t want to commit anything or wanna promise about our future but for now wanna keep this relationship talking about a near future.

It's another to basically state you two may never be together again, that you should have no commitment or expectations of each other. That he is saying this is very emotionally distancing and i don't think it bodes well for a successful committed longterm relationship. Planning a future around someone who talks like this is not a good idea, so I wouldn't move just for him.\n\nLDR is hard without a known end date. You need to decide for yourself if you want to continue a partnership with no defined future. And make sure you consider the emotional distance he's established. Him planning a trip means little if he is enforcing distance with his words. \n\nMaybe you are happy to gamble and see if the future puts you two together. Honestly, I think a clean break would be better and then if you happen to end up in the same place, you can rekindle your relationship if it works at that time.

This looks like *he* has doubts and is trying to preemptively distance himself from this relationship, in a way that isn't just \"his fault\" but can be blamed on logistics and him being too nice of a person to ask you to move to him. It's true that for two young people at the beginning of their careers, those decisions should be made based on what's best for you, and it's usually not moving across the world for a man!! But here it sounds like he presented this unilaterally and as a warning, rather than trying to discuss it as a couple or find out how you feel. That's a\u00a0bad sign in a relationship that's going to require a lot of negotiation, coordination and compromise. He is essentially saying he's not ready for that. He may have gotten into this thinking he was Ok with such a long distance situation, with its potential future complications, but now is not so sure.\n\n\n\nI feel obliged to note, his comments about \"i might hurt you\" could be mostly\u00a0based in trying to distance himself, or in anxiety, but some people who are controlling and manipulative will also say things like \"I really don't want to hurt you but I might\". It's partly a way to test the waters with you, to see whether you respond by reassuring them that it's ok, or to preemptively frame any bad things they do as hurtful *to them* as well. In this case I think he's just pulling away, but if I'm wrong this is something else to watch for.\n\n\n\nTo be honest I agree with the other comments that he is telling you he's not in this for the long haul, and a clean break would be best. But if you need more, try to talk to him again and seek\u00a0information, answers, and some kind of future expectations. If he won't sincerely engage in this kind of conversation past \"I don't know, things might go bad, don't blame me\".... Then\u00a0you don't have a relationship you could build a future on.",

We just had a fight about this and it was intense - I almost feel like I don\u2019t want to try anymore. \n\nI understand that he\u2019s busy and must be tired and I\u2019ve suggested a lot of different options. I guess what irks me is my friends who also have 9-5 jobs don\u2019t act like they can\u2019t meet me at all during the week and I personally don\u2019t see why meeting for an hour even is so difficult. I guess my expectations might be a bit much here - but I don\u2019t understand why after a year of dating, I can\u2019t be in his house while he\u2019s not there. Like today I suggested that I come over we hang out and then he can go to the office tomorrow and I can either leave w him or stay at his and then we can spend time together once he\u2019s back from work (I\u2019d obviously let him do this at my place)\n\nLike this is something I\u2019ve even done w my friends for example where they hang out at my place till I\u2019m done w work and once I\u2019m back we\u2019ll chill together so I don\u2019t find anything particularly odd about that - but when I told him this he said that us doing that would be \u201cweird\u201d\n\nI\u2019m frustrated because my girl friends are out of town rn and I only have one guy friend here and he won\u2019t let me hang out w guys (something I\u2019ve never had a problem with) but it\u2019s so frustrating that he won\u2019t hang out w me and won\u2019t let me hang out w someone else and then I just have to sit in my room bored and lonely. \n\nAlso (I do feel bad about this cause I really do care about his family n ik I\u2019m being unreasonable) but he mentioned that he can\u2019t even have one day off from work cause he\u2019s saving his holidays for when he visits his family months later - I got frustrated by this cause all I was asking for was one day (in the span of a year) and I don\u2019t understand why a grown man can\u2019t take one day out for his gf and has to save it all up for visiting his family months later \ud83d\ude2d\n\nWhat do you guys think? \n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend has a busy schedule, won\u2019t accept solutions, what do I do?

He may have a very insane job, be incredibly introverted, or may just not like you that much.\n\nYou can set a boundary. \"I need a boyfriend who can see me at least x times a week outside of weekends. If you can't do that, I will have to break up with you.\" Or, you can accept that you love this man so much that his weekends are enough. But i would ask him: \"hey. I foresee myself in a romantic relationship where eventually we share a home and personal spaces. You don't feel comfortable sharing a lot of time with me even at a year. What's going on?

Maybe you don't.\n\nFinally-- a busy boyfriend doesn't mean you have to sit at home, bored. You're young with a lot of energy! Find more girl friends. Join hobbies. Your boyfriend is not your entire life and this should never be true, even if your boyfriend wanted to spend more time with you. Also, i disagree with him refusing to let you hang out with other men. But that's a whole other point.",

If he wasn't convincing and therefore you dumped him, he'd have to find a new girlfriend. And if he spent time hanging out with you during the week, he wouldn't have the free time to do whatever he wants, which is likely what he's doing now.\n\nIt's time for you to move on from this guy, because he clearly isn't all that interested in being with you.\n\nI'll give you an example of what happens when people actually \\*want\\* to be together. When I started dating my now-wife, we lived in different cities, about 1.5 hr drive away from each other. So, that made it pretty difficult to see each other each evening, like we might have liked to do. But we \\*did\\* like each other a whole lot, and so we made things work - so on Wednesday night I'd get off work at 5:30 or so, I'd hop in my car (with an overnight bag) and drive to her place, getting there about 7. We'd hang out, get dinner, enjoy time together, then sleep over. The next morning I'd leave her place about 7 am, and get back to work around 8:30 am. And then on the weekend we'd pretty much do the same thing, except I drove to her place on Friday evening, and left on Monday morning. Also, we were perfectly happy to do the opposite where she drove to my place - but her work schedule was less friendly towards that arrangement. Long story short, we wanted to be together, so we were together. No corporate job is keeping your boyfriend from hanging out with you - he just prefers doing other stuff.",

He also moved in with me in august 2024 so we have been living together for a while now. \n\nBut last night I was sitting on my phone (keep in mind, my bf and I have been in a little rough patch lately, just not on the same wave length which is fine cause that\u2019s normal) but I had this gut feeling that I should go through his phone just because we haven\u2019t been talking a lot lately and things have seemed more off than they have been when we have had these ruts before. \n\nSo I went through his phone and everything just seemed silent in his phone which was odd for him. He\u2019s always had telegram and he uses it for bonuses for games he has and I\u2019ve looked at it before and it\u2019s always been fine. But when I looked last night there had to of been 30-40 different messages of him talking to other women. \n\nObviously my heart is racing and so I calmly try and wake him up, and he sees it and he gets up and storms out, and then comes back in and tells me \u201cdo you want to know the true reason why I was doing that\u201d and I said \u201cobviously\u201d and he said \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to tell you this but I\u2019ve been trying to scam people to get money because we have been so down bad\u201d which yes we have been very down bad with $ in our relationship. I unfortunately do not believe him, I will say the messages are only from the past week, they aren\u2019t from a long time ago so this must have been recent. \n\nI love him very much and our personalities match so well, but I know there are other people out there who wouldn\u2019t do that to me. I hope that I\u2019m not wasting my time trying to fix things with him if I decide to. \n\nTl;dr: found sexting messages in my boyfriends phone and hoping to figure out if it\u2019s worth to work on to get past this or break up  ",

Found out today that my sister's cancer diagnosis is a lot worse than what we thought. When I was still in the room talking to the doctor, I texted my boyfriend (24M) telling him my sister's 2 years life expectancy. Well, he did reply though telling me that I needed to stay strong, and that's about it.\n\nWhen I came out of the doctor's room, the first thing I really wanted to do is to cry out, talk, and call my boyfriend, and that is when I found out that he had started a game with his friends and couldn't talk to me for the until 2 hours later.\n\nMy boyfriend told me that had I told him to stop playing his games to call and talk to me, he would have. Although I can't help but to feel disappointed as I had expected him to offer me emotional support without me needing to ask. Not only did he not offer, he proceeded to occupy himself with games.\n\nHe has always been a gamer, but he didn't game as much when he first met me and has only gotten back into gaming when the honeymoon period died down. We have been dating for slightly over a year now. \n\nIdk, I am so heartbroken right now by what had just happened. This is the third time I am so disappointed as I had not received any emotional support from him during this entire time when my sister had to undergo surgery which heavily impacted my mental health too. I'm not sure if I'm overly emotional and irrational right now due to the series of events that have happened, but I really feel like giving up on this relationship. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.\n\nTldr; my boyfriend (24M) was busy playing games when I (23F) needed emotional support as my sister has been diagnosed with cancer. I feel like giving up on this relationship.",

                "body": "I think you definitely feel justified in being upset at the lack of initiative on his part, in general I feel that just shows a lack of emotional maturity on his part. However it does seem like a major issue is the lack of communication here. Should he need to be told to come and support you in this difficult time? No, its almost certainly the most obvious and empathetic thing to do. Nonetheless, if you know that he can struggle on this front you have 2 options. \n\n1. Talk to him. You say this is the 3rd time you've felt hurt this way, but have you actually talked to him after any of these times? Let him know that you need support, he says that if you call him he'll come to you, so maybe that's just what you should do, or tell him that you want him to take initiative and put in the effort for these situations. If he still doesn't, at that point maybe ending the relationship is a good idea, if he can't put in the effort that's just unfair to you, but at the same time, it's clear nothing is going to change if you don't do anything.\n\nAlternatively 2. You can just end it. If his lack of empathy has been a reoccurring issue, despite bringing it to his attention, or if you simply don't think the relationship is worth the effort then this might be the best option\n\nKeep in mind that all relationships are effort, romantic or not. If you want this relationship to continue, then talk to him, and get him to put in some more effort, but if he doesn't want to put in the effort to change, or if you don't think that this relationship is worth the effort or hurt you'll get in trying to change him, then I would suggest ending it, because nobody is going to be happy in that relationship.\n\nIn the end it's crucial to talk to him about what you want, even if it may seem obvious to you, maybe not so much to him.\n\nTL;DR\n\nTalk to him, make sure he knows what you want, if he doesn't change, or if you truly feel this relationship won't bring you happiness no matter what, then it's probably not a relationship worth pursuing. It might seem obvious, but some people struggle to pick up on these cues, it doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't want to support you.",

That\u2019s abdicating responsibility. He doesn\u2019t actually think she should have spelled it out\u2026 he just didn\u2019t care.",

        "text": "i (19F) and my boyfriend (18M) have been together for almost two years now. ever since we started dating his parents and his older sister has made it painfully clear that they do not like me. \n\nbackground: me and my current boyfriend started dating his junior year and my senior year of high school. previous to that we were good friends. i had been dating one of his friends my sophomore year until beginning of senior year until i broke it off because the things we wanted in life were completely different and i didn\u2019t see it working out in the future. i began dating my current boyfriend (ill call him will) in april of my senior year. even before we started dating, his parents and my ex\u2019s parents were good friends and when they realized i was with will, they began to dislike me. at first, it was just his mom. she would tell him things saying that i was not a good person for dating his friend and then him (which i know could come off as wrong but there was no unfaithfulness while dating my ex), and saying that she doesn\u2019t want him dating me. he stood up to her in the beginning until she started taking some drastic measures and at one point even came to me and begged me to stop being with her son. we broke up a couple times due to him not wanting to upset his parents but always got back together because we still loved each other. there was one time where they found out we were sexually active and his parents threatened to tell my parents everything that i had done and what has been going on. there was also another time where i had went to his house to just pick him up to grab some food, and his sister came up to me and basically told me i was immature and she had \u201cgone through something similar and knew that we wouldn\u2019t work out\u201d as well as yelling and crying telling me to leave will. i left and let him deal with his sister but during that time it mentally impacted me heavily so i just decided to distance myself to not see his family at all. \n\nnow to real time: \n**TL;DR** his sister currently also has a boyfriend who is the same race as me so i know it\u2019s not a race thing, and they treat him so well. they invite him to dinners, take him on family trips, and whatnot. i\u2019m currently a upcoming sophomore in college and he is about to graduate. we did long distance for a year and made it through. my boyfriend and i\u2019s relationship is great, we have no problems and plan on staying together and potentially moving in together in college (if his parents allow). it just bothers me because even though he\u2019s about to leave for college, his parents still try to control how much time he spends with me or even how late he stays out (sometimes telling him to come home at like 10pm when he has nothing else to do the next day). his mom in my eyes has been manipulating him as she\u2019ll make subtle \u201cjokes\u201d to try to get him to go home and at one point before we started dating, would cry to him about being depressed because he was going against what she told him to do. i\u2019ve been dealing with it up until now, but in my eyes, he\u2019s about to head off to college and his mom is still trying to control how much time he spends with me. i\u2019m also planning on transferring to the same college he is going to (not solely for him but for my major) and it\u2019s just frustrating. he doesn\u2019t want to always do what his mom says but he will sometimes cave when it comes to his mom controlling when he\u2019s out with me. i don\u2019t want his family to continue disliking me but i also don\u2019t know how to especially get his mom to change her opinion about me, so im not sure what to do at this point. are there any tips i can do?",

It seems that there is an unhealthy dynamic - is he the youngest child?  Is he the scapegoat? Are the mother and sister emotionally co-dependent?  Is the father a remote figure? How have they reacted to previous girlfriends?  \n\nHow did your ex react when you broke up?, because it seems like a weird thing for your current bfs parents to be fixated on.\n\nThere is nothing you can specifically do to get his mother to change her opinion/feeling about you.  I think your boyfriend needs to go to college, get away from that family dynamic and perhaps stop talking about you to his parents (I mean, don't lie or omit anything if they ask about you, but he could try not mentioning you or talking about you or bringing you up as a topic of conversation)",

        "text": "I (22F) had my best friend (23F) sleep over a couple weeks ago. The next morning, I gave her some clothes to wear as she didn\u2019t have new ones, it was just random stuff I had lying around, including a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt that used to belong to my ex. We\u2019ve joked before about how I still have a bunch of his stuff (he lived with me for a while, so yeah, some things stuck around).\n\nAbout a week later, I asked if she could return them. She said she would wash them first, which was fine. But now it\u2019s been another week and she told me she\u2019s not going to give them back. I was honestly confused and asked why. She said it\u2019s for my own good, implying that keeping his stuff around isn\u2019t healthy.\n\nI get the intention. A few months ago, she threw out a pair of his old slippers I had. At the time, I was in a good place and didn\u2019t really care, so I let it go. But this time feels different. I didn\u2019t ask her to get rid of anything, just to return it, and it\u2019s starting to annoy me. I feel disrespected, even if she thinks she\u2019s helping.\n\nHow should I handle this without blowing things out of proportion? I don\u2019t want to fight, but I also don\u2019t want to let my boundaries slide.\n\nTL;DR:\nI lent my best friend my ex\u2019s clothes to wear, asked for them back, and now she refuses to return them \u201cfor my own good.\u201d I understand her reasoning but it\u2019s upsetting me.

She's never actually taken the time to try to understand why you kept the stuff or even to help you delve into the reasons yourself. Is it a little weird? Maybe. Depends on whether or not the split was good or bad. If you ended on amicable terms because life got in the way, keeping an ex's things that they didn't ask to be given back is pretty common. But in the end, that's not her decision to make.\n\nFirst, I think you're going to have to accept that the clothes are probably gone already. If she threw away the slippers, I'm betting she tossed the clothes as soon as she removed them. I also wouldn't be surprised if she had taken other things belonging to your ex without you knowing.\n\nSecond, you need to have another conversation with her about returning the items. Be clear that it's not her choice to decide how you live your life and whether or not you keep stuff from an ex. That it is disrespectful to steal the items (literally - what started as borrowing is now stealing because she refuses to return a borrowed item). If she sticks to her position, then you may need to reconsider the entire friendship because it won't stop there.\n\nAnd if you do decide to cut contact with her over this, don't let her try to lay the blame on you with \"you'd really end a friendship over your ex's clothes?\". Remind her that she is the one that started all of this by stealing the items. And keep using the words \"steal\" and \"theft\".\n\nFinally, whatever you do, don't play \"whataboutism\". Doesn't matter if there are things in her life that you think she's doing wrong. You don't want to sink to her level and say something like \"And what if I took \\[blah\\]....\". All it does is show that you think that kind of action is appropriate on some level. You want to focus on HER bad actions towards you and nothing else.",

I know you think you are helping me move on but everyone does things in their own time. I will move on when I\u2019m ready and done grieving. Again in my own time. You can\u2019t force it by doing these things. So can we hug it out. No more taking things please and please return something of you still have it. Thank you for caring. I know you got my back. \n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work I dont know what to tell you op. Good luck.",

She thinks she's being helpful but it's disrespectful and you are not a child she needs to raise our protect. You'll get rid of those when you are ready not when she decides you are ready. Stop being passive. When it comes to yourself respect and how you will be treated always be ready to fight.",

It could have nothing to do with them belonging to ex.\n\nThat said, we don't really have context of that relationship or how it ended. Not saying what your friend did is okay. But if this was a toxic or abusive boyfriend I might understand her perspective. \n\nIt's still not okay though. A good friend would have a conversation with you about it. Maybe offer to hold on to the things for a week or so to give you a chance to see how it feels, not having them around. So that YOU could decide if it was time to let it go or if you wanted to keep them.",
