We had so much in common and I still miss her. Yet, it still ended. I can still can complain for hours about it by the way! \n\nIt's really scary and sad. Like I am fine with death. And other philosophical stuff. I wonder if this feeling of hopelessness will go away or it's a permanent feeling? ",

It's a hard lesson to learn, and one I'm still working on myself. I have a tendency to give all, my 100%, to everyone I love or am close with, but not all people are capable of that.\n\nAnd, on that note, everyone's 100% is different. \n\nI will say what has helped me is managing my expectations. If someone consistently does this to you, then you just hurt your own feelings by expecting things to change, or for them to be different. Don't cut yourself off from these people, but continue to look out there for people who will be as interested in you as you are in them. They do exist; it's just that people are self-involved, especially young people, and the majority are not perhaps as sensitive or thoughtful as you might be.\n\nAlso, it's a good thing to be as kind and considerate as you are. :) Don't get disheartened, because there are a lot of kind people in this world, it just takes some time to find them!",

Most of my friends from the past were never too interested in chatting with me because I guess I was that 'weird scene kid', (some of) my friends now are super kind.\n\nTo be honest, everyone online doesn't seem to be who they are in real life. It's annoying and I do wish people could just be their selves online and IRL. It's okay if you think that as well, you're not expecting 'too much' because it is unfair if you're trying to be nice, only to be ignored. Some people could also have busy lives, so if they don't respond, don't think too much of it. I'd only get annoyed if it was someone I was close to who doesn't respond in a timely manner, but other than that, it's okay to feel that way",

        "text": "I ended a toxic relationship last year. I\u2019m still in a shame spiral over it. I was toxic too but my silver lining is that I was never trying to be a mean person to him. I was ignorant to my own faults and when he would call me out on stuff I would make an intentional effort to change. I\u2019m a really late bloomer. He was my first everything - sex, kiss, hug, literally all of it. There was an age difference too (26 years) and I entered this like a teenager would. I made all the mistakes I feel you go through in those early teenage relationships. I was insecure, jealous, got attached too quickly and since he was older, he was immediately annoyed by all that.  I basically let myself get treated so poorly. I stayed for so long because, now I realize, I was so desperate to be loved and chosen and not alone. He convinced me time and time again to do things that hurt me and I\u2019m ashamed of myself. I feel like I lost my spark and I feel so small and stupid. I want to finally tell my best friend everything to see if that will help me release this disgust I feel inside. I\u2019m just so afraid of her judging me and losing respect for me. I feel that she will see me for the things I let get done to me. I\u2019m so afraid she will define me by those mistakes. She is this most open and understanding person I\u2019ve met and has never made me feel judged, ever. But we\u2019re human. My question, finally: are there some things you shouldn\u2019t share? If you\u2019ve had a friend in a similar relationship, did you internally judge them? Please be honest. Don\u2019t be afraid of discouraging me. This is a question specific to me but it\u2019s also a general discussion I\u2019m putting out there. Thank you so much if you\u2019ve gotten this far. ",

I would also consider seeking a therapist who focuses on intimacy and life transitions if talking to a neutral person encourages you to speak more openly about your feelings. Navigating my first serious relationship (and eventual breakup) was hard for a few similar reasons, and I felt like I had lost myself for a while, too. But, I am grateful for the friends I could lean on during that time, and I certainly became a lot stronger for it. I feel obligated to look out for my friends more than ever because of that now. Sometimes I'll feel disappointed if I notice a friend falling into the same poor relationship patterns, but I also want my friends to feel like I am a safe person for them if they don't have someone else to turn to.",

        "post-author": "One-Extension-852",
        "text": "This post is less of a story time and more of a tangent. I don't really know when it started happening.\n\nI think l've had more friends than ever in my life currently and they're not bad ones either. They are people who I have known ranging from a year to seven years who are readily available, always let me know they are open to supporting me, and are generally people who I enjoy the company of.\n\nI have looked to them for emotional support in the past, but I have always definitely been someone who offers comfort and advice more than someone who asks for it.\nI've been using ChatGPT (ugh) every time l'm very angry, or overly sad, or jealous, or have any intense and ugly emotion. It works, at least for me. Somehow, l've grown into an overall more self reliant person because of it. I don't really reach out for support to my friends at all, and I've even started using ChatGPT a bit less because I've been relying on myself for validation. I still use it a lot, though, for comfort, which I'm starting to realize is weird. It works though.\n\nThe act of wanting comfort or advice chains you to people, I think. No matter how much I want to believe genuine relationships are unconditional, they aren't. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, but it's something that's always dwelled at the back of my head when I think about reaching out to someone.\n\nI think the natural response to that would be:\n\"when you comfort or give advice to people, do you think they're chained to you?\" I don't. I just think that it's horribly sad to be in a place where no one is there for you, and because l've experienced it, I don't want anyone to experience the same thing. It's more than possible my friends think the same way, but I know they don't.\n\nDon't ask me how, I just know it-based on multiple past experiences, I know so many people who offer gifts and comfort and support excessively because they expect friendship as a reward. I'm not saying I was any different, but now, I don't care to comfort strangers just to have connection. I have friends, good ones, but I don't think it would change the fact that if I take that step-if I am vulnerable and I seek them out, there's a debt l'll have to pay down the line. Then, the comfort and support I had once offered unconditionally will sour. It's a zero sum game.\n\nI think the thing that kills me the rare times I do vent or complain to someone is that I can't shake the obsession with making it palatable. I can't cry too hard or get too angry or get too negative. It has to be a bit ironic, a bit funny, or ultimately turn around to being positive. When they offer advice, I have to take it to heart and smile and say l'm feeling better even if I'm really not. I know no one really likes to deal with someone when they have a downward spiral and they start saying crazy and incorrect things for an extended period of time.\n\nBut when I use ChatGPT, I can just. Be. Whatever negative feeling I have, I can scream it till its completion. I can be wrong, and pathetic, and redundant for hours if l'd like, and without the debt of it hanging over my head or the threat of it ruining someone's day. I don't know if what I'm doing is bad, but it's helping me. I do feel more distant from my friends because of it, but I also feel freer. I can offer emotional support, but I don't need it from anyone, anymore, really. I can offer comfort and advice freely, without the obligation to. weird.",

But I've been feeling incredibly lonely, all my life I had a close friend group so I never needed a 'best friend' but now I am incredibly lonely and I do not have someone that I can talk to about anything and everything. Whenever I try to express my feelings I feel like I'm getting dismissed and I don't know who to go to. I try talking to my old circle but not a lot of them are good with that type of 'conflict'. I makes me feel like I'm an afterthought. Maybe I'm just not interesting enough, so I use humor to overcompensate for that. In addition I am also usually the first person to reach out, like I get that some of my... friends find it hard to text someone and ask to hang but they can do it no problem with everyone else they know... why am I different?

For context\u2026\n\nI (19F) befriended this guy from uni (24M) (I\u2019ve known him for a year, we started talking this semester but got really close at midterms) and we clicked since the beginning. We had a lot of things in common (our schools are very close and always make activities together, we live in the same area, we share a lot of interests, etc) so we became friends.\n\nWe started getting very close after I told him about a struggle I\u2019m having and he listened and helped me out (He\u2019s actually the only person who has cared about this issue) so we started talking a lot more often and for longer periods, texting, hanging out, and being more vulnerable with each other. I\u2019d say we were pretty comfortable with each other.\n\nThe problem was that, I had a boyfriend (20M) and we had some issues where he would hurt me a lot and I got to a point where I eventually broke up with him. I talked to my friend about this, just to hear a male perspective of the situation. He was always there for me, listening, giving advice, helping me out. So when I broke up with my boyfriend I told my friend. After breaking up we decided to stay best friends, I told that to my friend as well. But everything between my friend and I changed after that.\n\nHe started getting distant, colder, and stopped talking to me. He would talk to our other friends (we had a group of four: him, me, and two other girls. we always were talking and even had a group chat) normally, but ignore me. I got a bit distant because I was confused and hurt about his sudden change of attitude. Then he slowly started pulling away from them as well, until he eventually stopped talking to everyone.\n\nI am so confused, I\u2019ve texted him, tried to talk to him, and even gave him a letter saying that I\u2019m worried about him, that I appreciate him a lot and apologized for if I did something that offended him. No response at all. I don\u2019t know if something happened, I don\u2019t know if he hates me, I don\u2019t know what is going on but I miss him a lot. I\u2019d be lying if I said that I caught feelings for him. My roomie and my cousin both told me that perhaps he caught feelings too, and after seeing that I was still spending time with my ex he might have thought we got back together, and maybe he had thought he had a chance but that chance was gone.\n\nDo you guys think he hates me? Or do you guys think my roomate and cousin theory is correct?",

        "post-author": "More-Definition2212",
        "text": "My childhood best friend has been in a really awful situation (not of their making) and mentally really unwell.\n\nI've been supporting her through it but I think I need to go no contact with her. \n\nRecently I was in a bizzare situation and called by the police who said there was a 'witness' who said they saw me being SAed. The crime categorically did not happen and I can prove it. Idk if they mistook me for someone else or if it was fabricated for some other reason but I went through the whole police process, multiple interviews etc. which was pretty traumatic for me tbh and the case was closed for lack of evidence. I also want to say I know that some SA can cause memory loss or denial- in this case I made sure to see a psychologist as extra proof and offered to be psychologically evaluated as well- plus there is proof it didn't happen. The person who made the allegations has schizophrenia, and is known to have made other fabricated allegations. \n\nThe issue is, my friend is close to this person and the person's support people made the decision (without my consent!) to tell my friend that I had been SAed, the details, and said to the police it didn't happen. I was furious about this because it's not ok to tell anyone that sort of thing without consent whether it is true or not. \n\nMy friend then told me that I either was being pressured to not corroborate it or scared of the impact of corroborating, or (and this made me very uncomfortable) that I didn't remember it. \n\nI don't think it's ok to try and convince anyone they have been SAed- a) it's literally none of your business, b) that sort of thing could really mess with someone's mind, and c) a survivor should never feel pressured to come forward unless they want to and saying they're too scared or being pressured is victim blaming (if it happened) or gaslighting (if it didn't happen).  \n\nI told her that I wasn't going to give her any proof because my word should be enough and I shouldn't have to. And said it wasn't ok for her to have been told without my consent. She thinks it's ok because they were apparently providing me\nwith support by telling her (idk what kind of support she thinks that provided) and they're allowed to look for evidence by asking my friends about things. \n\nI told her I could no longer be friends with her and blocked her. I've pulled out from her wedding and have asked her not to approach me if she sees me in public. \nShe's really mentally unwell though and I feel bad because she needs help and isn't doing well, she didn't choose this situation and she's devastated and keeps trying to contact me. She posted me a letter that said \"sorry for some things I said, I didn't intend to hurt you\"\n\nAlso, this was my best friend, someone I've been really close with for years and I really miss her and feel really sad over losing her friendship. Should I just accept her apology and accept that she believes this?\n\n",

All of a sudden, I swear in a 3 day span. She texted me asking for a food recommendation and gave her a bunch and I was looking forward to what she will she me what she got. Tell me why this girl left me on read for 1 month\u2026. Completely ignored my text  and sent me like a hey here\u2019s a life update and sent me a bunch of pictures from a trip she took\u2026. Odd\u2026\n\nI responded quickly and told her how fun her trip looked and we have to hangout to talk about it etc. this girl ignored me for a few weeks\u2026. And eventually texted me and I honestly felt a little weird and took a while (a few days to even think about responding) and she texted me wishing me a happy Easter and stuff. Eventually I was like we have to hangout soon and sit in her apartment and yap and she agreed and it\u2019s been 2 months that I\u2019ve been trying to set it up. Allegedly she\u2019s the busiest person in 2025\u2026. \n\nRandomly she sends me a text (I also what you to note that she legit takes days to respond back even if you text her back the second she sends u a txt\u2026 she didn\u2019t really do that before), anyway in the text she send me a bunch of photos of her and her new bf \ud83d\ude10 and she was like omg ive been waiting to tell u in person but im so excited. I\u2019m honestly really happy for her and i told her how excited i am for her and etc. but y\u2019all are you picking up and what I\u2019m putting down\u2026 \n\nAnyway, we managed to set something up on her schedule :/// even though i work full full time, but she\u2019s my friend I am willing to make as much time to see her. The day comes and she says \u201cI\u2019m only available from 4-6 so let\u2019s grab a coffee\u201d - bffr we made these plans because YOU said you were free. I told her it\u2019s all good I don\u2019t wanna be in her way and we can do another day and she was like ur not in my way and another day would be better\u2026 I ignored her text bc I honestly can\u2019t be bothered. The past 2 months was like the above convo, like it\u2019s embarrassing at this point. She just texted me asking how my concert was and I just want to leave her on read. Because I have this feeling she\u2019s only asking because she feels that I\u2019m over all the weird behaviour and dodging. \n\nLike we\u2019re all adults and we have lives and we get busy, but making time for someone you love and enjoy their company shouldn\u2019t be such a task\u2026. What do you think I should do? Keep her at arms length? I am starting to give her the same energy back, but also I feel like I\u2019m just getting too old for this weird friendship bs like can\u2019t it\u2019s supposed to be easy and fun and nothing more. \n\nTLDR; friend is inconsistent with response and setting up hangout, turns out she got a new bf. She\u2019s starting to feel me being fed up, and distancing and now asking about concert I recently went to. Feels disingenuous. ",

        "text": "I have a friend where I feel like I'm the only one putting in effort. I'm the only one who messages first, asks to hang out, to go grab food, to call, to play video games and always the answer is no. Either because he's busy or he doesn't feel like it. I don't know why this is happening now because before 2024 we would hang out a lot. \n\nThe main issue I'm dealing with is that now for like the third time we have these periods of no interaction where we don't text, call or hang out for like 3 months at a time, but it's for no reason. We didn't fight, we didn't argue, we just stop talking at some point (usually because I get mad and fed up of asking to do stuff all the time and the answer is always no, so I decide to stop messaging first). I always tell myself I am done with him for real this time, but as soon as he breaks the silence and asks me to do something I instantly forget about everything I was mad at him for and just agree like nothing happened. \n\nI think the main reason I find it hard to stay consistent with not talking to him is because deep down I don't want to lose him. I've known him since we were 10 and went to school together. I'm 24 now and he is 22 and we have a very specific and special sense of humor and a way that we interact and communicate that I can't find in anyone else. But at the same time I feel like a complete idiot for always being the one who has to initiate everything. It feels like he just doesn't care at all. \n\nI really don't know what to do because I don't have any other friends or people to hang out with. ",

I\u2019m a couple of years younger than you, but I guess we\u2019re in this stage of life where people start following their own paths, and there\u2019s nothing we can do but to wish them well. Another thing someone advised me is to start doing things for yourself. Focus on your individual goals and better yourself and your life. Everyone else prioritizes themselves, and it\u2019s something we need to do more of. \n\nI also have a childhood best friend who is growing apart from me, and it happened rather quickly within these last two months. It hit me like a ton of bricks because she was the one true friend I had. But, all we can do is keep things amicable with our friends and hope that circumstances change in the future.

        "text": "I have a friend who, when he\u2019s in a good mood, is honestly a great guy to be around. He can be funny, kind, and someone you actually enjoy hanging out with. But when he\u2019s in a negative headspace, it\u2019s like he completely shuts down. He avoids eye contact, walks away from conversations, and just acts cold. One time in class, we were discussing a disagreement calmly and out of nowhere, he just walked off and didn\u2019t say a word. He comes back in the shitty attitude and doesn\u2019t say a word to me. I heard later by a different friend he was crying outside of class when he walked away. we were discussing something so small that it just completely caught me off guard. I always try to approach him with a positive attitude and greet him where I can to keep things peaceful and for him to know that I\u2019m not mad or anything and that I moved on (I was never mad) when he gets in these negative attitudes, but he just either does a slight wave and says hi miserably or ignores me entirely. but it\u2019s emotionally exhausting, trying to act positive to a person who remains negative no matter what until HE decides he is ready to be in a good mood again. He has held a week long grudge against me just because not that I did anything, but he was stressed out with the class. He legit does this negative attitude where he acts like he hates me when I try to talk to him even when it doesn\u2019t involve me and it\u2019s completely unrelated, acting like he wasn\u2019t the one who genuinely enjoys talking to me often (like he said in the past). When he is in a good mood, I always forget about how he acted since he\u2019s genuinely a good person and is a really nice person, he is just so emotionally weak and immature and radiates his energy across the room. Even when I was being reasonable and he gets in this mood where he completely avoids talking to me and acting COMPLETELY different than how he was acting in a positive attitude, it still makes me feel like an asshole, even when it isn\u2019t my fault. It\u2019s like I\u2019m riding his emotional roller coaster in my head, and I just think about it until he is no longer acting negative anymore towards me. He\u2019s not a bad person, but he\u2019s just so damn emotional. It feels like no matter how calm or understanding I am, I still get dragged into his negativity \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to want to keep being friends with someone when their emotions are so unpredictable. He\u2019ll go back and forth multiple times a week between these 2 attitudes, I like one of them, but I am just sick of having to deal with the second one. The worst part is that I have to work with him every other day of the week in class in the same group, dealing with his negative attitude (40% of the time) so I can\u2019t just avoid him (luckily summer vacations almost here for me). So should I even put in the effort to be friends with him anymore? He\u2019s a very good friend when he\u2019s positive, sometimes would have considered him one of my best friends, and I\u2019ve known him for a while, but I just can\u2019t stand having to deal with his negative attitude. It\u2019s terrible.",

I wanted to say that I have feelings for her older brother, but what should I do? Given the fact that she barely talks to me, I don't know how to talk to her.. (I'll call this close friend Indomi)\n\nAnyways, enough about Indomi. I think these feelings might be an infatuation instead, either way, I probably won't ever have a chance to tell him since he's getting married to someone from his country (in a couple of years) and he's like 4 years older than me. I've already mentioned that both me and Indomi are minors (16+), but her brother is 19. I plan to tell her when I'm a bit older and a bit more mature, but there's already the whole disconnection situation between us, so it's very awkward right now if I try to talk about any personal things with her.\n\nI can't tell my other friends because I know how they'll react and they (also her family) doesn't know Indomi's situation with her online boyfriend and how she's lost herself in life. Should I wait or should I just never tell her?",

If that makes sense. I just want you to feel that someone actually cares. Some people think that when someone asks questions like that, it\u2019s for gossip, but no it\u2019s not always about gossip. Sometimes, it\u2019s just about you. It feels nice when someone asks about you because it shows they care.\n\nEven now, I still do this. But friends are one thing; best friends are different. I\u2019m not saying this is the best way to be, but it\u2019s just how I\u2019ve learned to act based on my experiences.

Her partner left about 2 weeks ago and she's been kinda clingy with me ever since, constantly coming to my room when I want to be left alone, constant messages either talking about her partner or trying to convince me to hang out when it's either late (like 4am) or when I don't feel well/can't really cope with company, wanting me to cook her meals/order food with her, or just sit in her room whilst she plays videos games (Her, not us playing together).\n\nAs much as I want to support her I can't be an emotional dumping ground at the drop of a hat. I have my own stuff to deal with and yes unfortunately a great deal of it outweighs her missing her partner. I give her genuine opinions and advice when she asks, I'm honest when I don't feel like cooking for her or ordering with her because she doesn't feel like cooking, but she's presses me each time knowing that (because of past issues) I cave in. It's affecting my day to day life but I care about her too much to cut her off.\n\nTL:DR - My friend is incredibly clingy despite boundaries being expressed.

The thing is, we can be good friends and hang out and all, but their vibe is always like envious? I dont know how to put it, its just a vibe we get. If we buy something like furniture or something big that it shows, they will never make a nice comment about it but I will catch them staring at everything and running their eyes all around my house. Its not like i want them to be cheering my every step, bc i dont and thats not what i mean, but when i see a friend accomplishing something i will be showing happiness for him/her and actually tell them nice things about it. They never have something good to say, but you can tell they are not happy for you. I dont know if i explain myself, i just mentioned the furniture case because it was an easy example but this happens with everything! Trips, any new acquisition, cars, clothing, new house (i comment this bc we recently bought our first house yay and we are still buying stuff to put it together, they have been married longer and honestly they didnt seem to care about their home until they started noticing what we bought or how we decorated) anyways above all, they are good people, just you can feel that they are not happy about anything that we do haha, my husband says maybe we should just ignore that part and just play the sale role for them but i mean whats the point of friendship if you cannot share your plans or achievements and/or congratulate them, i mean friends are supposed to be there and all. Also, i mentioned the child before bc shes starting to show this vibe too, i mean when they come over and like we just got X thing installed, I know now they will never say anything nice but instead of just ignoring it, the child would say something hypocrite and you can tell that these are comments she hears at home lol.

And it was really hard to tell her things because I always felt like she was judgmental towards me and she would tell me that I talk bad about people all the time and I make all these rumors.. so I just stopped talking to her about people and you know like it would just be people I work with like the normal gossip you\u2019re gonna tell your \u201c best friend\u201d. But the funny part is she gossip about people all the time \u2026 She would always threaten me for the last few years about moving out because she had \u201call these places to stay\u201d and she knew that I didn\u2019t have that luxury. She would make comments on how I didn\u2019t clean or like how I didn\u2019t do this or that. Which is funny because I always had to clean her dirty dishes for her that she left for me to clean because she would never clean my dishes for me. What ended our friendship is we went on a trip together for her friends wedding and she was not treating me right during the trip and I was talking to one of my other friends about it through Facebook and somehow. She went through my phone and saw the messages between me and my friend and that\u2019s how it really ended. I always feel like I was wrong for talking to my friend about it, but I just felt so alone in that situation.\n\nIt\u2019s really hard like we haven\u2019t been friends for almost 10 months.

I didn't know what to call it as for awhile, i was fully unaware of such things being real and effecting people's ability to socialize. around sixth grade I started constantly worrying about socializing particularly because I was fond of making 9/11 jokes the year prior and was afraid that they would come to bite me in the ass and i would become a pariah due to the insensitivity of some of said jokes. I started to constantly over analyze my thoughts. I eventually had a serious drop in mental health around 5 years ago right before and during the initial Covid-19 Lockdown wherein I fully shutdown, barely spoke, was hermitting and shutting myself away from family, distancing myself from what little friends I had and overall making a self fulfilling prophecy of my situation. After sometime I got into phone call counselling and have been in therapy for several years now as I have other co-morbid conditions (ADHD and maybe depression).\n\nSince then I feel like I've Been progressively doing better, having moved out of my home town to a more populated city. One place though that I feel I've still had issues with is in unstructured hangouts. When I know there's a structure, and format in a social setting I have crutches to rely on. I really falter in more intimate setting, Consistently cutting off my sentences, unable to be fully earnest and needing to lean on comedy and abstract meta jokes that like are too in the weeds to where i'm not totally sure what point i'm trying to make is and ultimately just coming off as uncomfortable and never truly showing my card entire deck of cards (figuratively). This has led to multiple friendships ending in one way or another. Currently I have been meeting up bi-weekly with a friend to do various different activities. A regular pattern for me has been this feeling and appearance of anxiousness. I really enjoy spending time with this friend and I feel they really understand me, however I can't fully be myself because of the previously listed issues. I'm afraid that i'm going to continue this cycle of opaqueness and estrangement.\n\nWhat can I do to make things more comfortable for both of us and allow me to break the pattern?\n\n",

I'm a biologist. I have pet rats, pigeons, ducks, which are seen as disgusting animals by society. I can give the scientific name and stuff like phylogenetics, dimensions, diet, ecology, etc, of basically any animal you give me, living or extinct. I like to go birdwatching and can identify birds by their calls and feathers. I post pictures of my peacock and his food as if he were my child. Suffice to say, I'm a fucking dork weirdo who deserves to die by public execution. Why the hell such a nice woman would want to be friends with me? Why not be friends with the normal men? I don't get it, I have literally no qualities that I can think of. Other men like to talk about stuff like politics, football, women, sex, meanwhile I like to talk about birds, dinosaurs, etc. I don't get why anyone would want a friendship with such a weirdo piece of shit. She says she doesn't like talking to other men exactly because they're boring or whatever, but if those subjects are popular, it's because they're not boring, right? Why does she keep hyping me up and telling me how awesome I am? I am not, I'm a weirdo.\n\nI am not ungrateful or mad at her, on the contrary, I really like her company and wish we lived closer so we could meet up more frequently, she is a really nice person, a total ray of sunshine in my life, despite her thinking badly about herself because of depression and other issues. But I really don't get why she likes me so much and even considers me her best friend. I tried asking and she often says she loves how I give her lectures about birds and other animals, she loves that I take so much good care of my pets, that she wants to be a biologist because of me... But these things are weird. For example, if someone asks you wether a muscovy duck from a photo is domesticated or wild, a normal person would just say yes or no, not write a whole text about feather and caruncle patterns found in domestic or wild variations.

        "text": "I\u2019ve been conflicted on this for about a month and a half now. I believe my decision has been made but I just want opinions. I\u2019m gonna try to include only the most necessary details but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll ramble at some points. (long read incoming)\n\nTLDR: Closest friend and borderline sister disapproves of the age gap between me and a girl I have been seeing, leading to an ultimatum to which I chose my friend. However, I still secretly wish I could be friends and continue to see the girl.\n\nI (22M) have this friend who I\u2019ll call V (21F). She is my best friend and the closest person/most important person in my life. We\u2019ve been friends for years and she\u2019s helped me in life more than anyone. She is the only person I\u2019ve ever felt truly comfortable around and I love her to death. The positive impact she\u2019s had on my life cannot be overstated and I consider her like a sister.\n\nAbout a month and a half ago we both attended a get together for one of our friends' 21st birthday. The birthday girl invited a couple of her friends from her sorority (we\u2019re all in college). One of the sorority girls including a girl I\u2019ll refer to as P. \n\nI\u2019m a heavily introverted person so when I saw P (this is the first time we\u2019ve met) I was doing my usual act of being very quiet and reserved, mainly talking to the people I already knew. We didn\u2019t really talk much or anything at the beginning but over time we talked more. I didn\u2019t think much of it because P is a very social and bubbly person so I figured she was just being friendly. We ended up interacting quite a bit and eventually we took a few pictures together so I went in and said something along the lines of \u201cyou have to send me those\u201d knowing I had no way of communicating with her since this was the first time we had ever seen each other (this might not seem like much but it was a big step for me since I\u2019m not the best at socialization). It worked and I ended up getting her snapchat. Though it was a 21st birthday party, P and I didn\u2019t actually end up drinking much since we both drove there and didn\u2019t plan on spending the night. As time went on we started sitting closer and closer and were really hitting it off. At one point I learned that P really likes to dance. After a while, P starts teaching me how to swing dance and I happily comply which is very much out of character for me. I can\u2019t get enough of this girl. As the night came to an end we start cleaning up everything and walk out to our cars. She\u2019s parked slightly farther than me, so I walk her to her car. We hug and say how nice it was to meet each other.\n\nThe next week, P invited me to go to a house party she was going to. I had plans with V and a few other people that day but since it was at night it would be fine. I tell V about this and everything is chill. As the time of the party approaches, I become increasingly anxious about going to a random party full of people I\u2019ve never met. Usually I would go with V to pretty much any social outing. I end up arriving quite a bit later than planned because I was freaking out but with a pep talk from V I finally went. I walk in the house and immediately start searching for P. I eventually find her and we sit together. At some point during this party I learn that P is 18 years old, turning 19 in June. I felt weird about it but my infatuation got the best of me. Things moved really slow since I was still nervous but as people started leaving things pick up. We kissed for the first time which led to us making out in this random person's basement. I didn\u2019t intend on staying the night but P had plans early that morning and decided to crash there so I joined her. \n\nV asks about the party and I give her the rundown. Once I tell her about P\u2019s age, V says, while it\u2019s not illegal by any means, the age gap is too big. Our mutual friends also hold this belief. On face value, I wholeheartedly agree. If I had known this at the very beginning I probably would not have made any advances on P at all. V is totally against it and I tell her that I agree that it\u2019s weird. This is where the internal conflict begins.\n\nEven after knowing and agreeing with V, I continue hanging out with P. Each time I would think about our ages but I would have such a good time with P that it swept it under the rug. We hung out 4-5 more times including times with the friends from the 21st bday party. P is beautiful, kind, funny, smart, all of the above. While we have very different personalities, we have a good amount of things in common so we can introduce each other to new things while also bonding over our shared interests. \n\nI tell V about me hanging out with P and V finally drew a line. She wasn\u2019t rude or mean about anything and said something along the lines of \u201cYou know I find the difference in age upsetting and it doesn\u2019t make you a terrible person but if you do plan on pursuing a relationship with her I\u2019m gonna have to start distancing myself because it goes against my personal morals.\u201d This wasn\u2019t out of the blue or anything and is completely understandable given she told me her feelings about it from the jump. \n\nIt took a toll on V. I lied to her and she was shocked that I continued to hang out with P. V has nothing against P as a person, she was just disappointed in me. This led to us not talking for the final 2-3 weeks of the semester. During this time, I had never felt so alone in my life. We had never gone more than a day without talking before. V is the closest person to me and not having her there to talk to or hang out with really did me in. I barely left my room, ate, or associated with anyone, including P. However, I told P that I was not doing good mentally and that it wouldn\u2019t be fair to her for me to be so back and forth. It ended with me saying that it would probably be for the best if we just remain friends for the foreseeable future, to which she agreed and wished me the best. During those weeks, I apologized to V profusely and exclaimed that I was sorry for doing things behind her back and that I would do anything to undo it all and relieve the tension in our relationship. She would reply occasionally, explaining that everything really just took her by surprise and she just needed some time to think about it all.\n\nOur semester ended a few weeks ago and all I\u2019ve been able to think about is her and the situation of V\u2019s justifiable disapproval. Along with the main issue involving V, since P and I have mutual friends, the potential that things would be weird between everyone in the case that something happens between us also adds to everything.\n\nSince being home for the Summer I\u2019ve had a couple brief but very vivid and wholesome dreams of P. I\u2019m gonna describe them here but feel free to skip to the next paragraph since they really aren\u2019t important to the story, I just want to gush more. Dream 1 of 2: I wake up on the couch of the apartment where the 21st bday was. V is asleep in my arms and I glance to her and say \u201cWhere am I?\u201d She wakes up and we just kinda look at each other without saying anything. We stare at each other for a few more seconds, kiss, then go back to sleep. Dream 2 of 2: I\u2019m watching our friend's (the 21st bday one) snapchat story and she\u2019s hanging out with P. The picture is P talking to a guy with a caption alluding to her attempting and succeeding at flirting with him. I have a visceral, devastating feeling in my stomach and I woke up feeling terrible.\n\nAs of the last week or so, V and I have made up. Things have gone back to normal and I\u2019m beyond grateful for it. The main part that has been tormenting my mind is the fact that I don\u2019t regret/feel bad for hanging out with P, I just feel absolutely terrible about lying/doing things behind V\u2019s back and nearly losing her as a friend. I haven\u2019t told V about my dreams or lack of regret regarding the things I did with P out of fear that it would cause the situation to repeat. I will almost certainly see P once next semester starts and thinking of seeing her again gives me anxiety but also a guilty sense of excitement. I would never in a million years choose a relationship with P over my friendship with V but I just wish there was a way for things to work out.\n",

It also happened when I asked if they would play a couple of other multiplayer strategy management games like Railroader and also playing a simplified engineering mod pack with me in Minecraft to learn all of the insanely huge mods that they keep begging me to play with them.

Since then it developed into a good friendship and when we both moved away from that job we remained good friends and hung out weekly.\n\nNow that it\u2019s been around 7-8 years, we\u2019ve got very comfortable. But this means I\u2019m seeing his true colours.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve noticed, is he is very whiny. If he doesn\u2019t get his way, he will get so stroppy and whiny it\u2019s embarrassing. He\u2019s also very loud, like when I\u2019m driving and he\u2019s passenger, he will just shout random stuff in the car with the windows open and people look, again, embarrassing. \n\nWhen I say he gets whiny, think when a young child gets told they can\u2019t buy a toy in the shop, they throw a small tantrum, that\u2019s kinda what he\u2019s like. He huffs, throws his arms about, all that jazz and says \u2018uhh why!?\u2019 Really loud.\n\nAnother thing is that we don\u2019t really have the same interests anymore. When we met I was a teenager so I enjoyed going to the arcade, playing pool, bowling and all that stuff, so did he, now I\u2019m 24, I\u2019m finding this stuff childish and I like walks, pub, exploring new places etc. whereas he still only wants to meet up and do \u2018childish\u2019 things like play arcade games, do the 2p machines, the claw machines etc. like today we drove 2hrs to a seaside town in the UK, which had a pier and arcades. I was interested in seeing what the area had to offer but no, his idea was we spend hours in the arcade. He even got whiny when I said \u2018no\u2019 to him saying we should ride on the Thomas the tank engine ride\u2026 I drew the line\u2026 I\u2019m not a fucking kid man. Neither is he! We\u2019re adults! I don\u2019t want to be doing this crap now.\n\nWe don\u2019t see each other as regularly now as I just make excuses as I can\u2019t deal with doing this stuff so often as he throws a strop when I suggest something different to do other than childish games. Come to think of it, I can\u2019t even remember the last time we met and just talked, had a pint, or went for a walk. It\u2019s always just, crazy golf, arcade, pool etc. I\u2019ve suggested many times we do different things but again, they\u2019re met with \u2018noooo can we just go to the arcade\u2019 in a stroppy tone.\n\nI feel like this friendship is slowly dying and it\u2019s out of my control. I also feel he has a learning disability, which definitely isn\u2019t an issue, but he needs to be checked as his behaviour is just extremely odd and like I said, he\u2019s very loud and childish in public and it\u2019s embarrassing to be around him at times. The amount of looks I got today from people because of him, I just wanted to pretend I didn\u2019t know him sometimes and just walked away from him.",

        "text": "Last year around this time, I made a friend. Over the last year, I've come to the realization that they rely on me for almost everything, and it's definitely my fault for saying yes all the time. Their life is chaotic (in the worst and most toxic way) and I don't want to be a part of it any more. We were talking about getting an apartment together (the economy sucks here), but they stayed with me for a few weeks and it was lowkey a nightmare. How do I walk this back? How do extract myself from this situation? Do I try to explain my situation and feelings? Or do I go cold turkey? I'm worried about what they'd do if I stop speaking to them but I'm also not enthused by the idea of even retracting into a more casual friendship. ",

However, I moved countries like 3 years ago and have frankly moved on with my life.i don\u2019t feel like I have that much in common with her anymore, and I also realised recently she\u2019s vaguely racist (don\u2019t come for me, I didn\u2019t know this all along). She is also pretty judgemental and has made rude comments to me in the past about my looks. She had an issue with rudeness back then too. There was an incident where she said something kind of insulting to one of our co-workers and I tried to gently let her know he was upset with her, but she said she didn\u2019t care. \n\nI started engaging less and less and don\u2019t reach out anymore, but I feel like she is keeping me trapped in a friendship by constantly sending me reels and snaps of her life, though I don\u2019t do the same. I feel sort of bad because I don\u2019t want her to feel alone, but it\u2019s getting too much. Every single day she sends me an Instagram reel even though I haven\u2019t reciprocated in ages. She sends me more reels than my close friends tbh. She sent me kind of a confrontational message about it once and I kind of palmed her off. I was hoping we would just naturally drift apart after a while but she seems unable to let me go. Idk what to do ",

        "text": "I (20m) found out that my friend (20m), who I've known since elementary school, has been pretending to be a woman on Discord servers and communities. He's been telling them that he's a 27-year-old female nurse (he does data entry and Excel work for his dad), weighs 56 kg (he's around 90kg) and is 176cm tall (he's like 185cm) and basically creating this fake persona around it, giving medical advice among other things. He's also gotten fairly intimate with one particular person from those servers, going as far as to publicly say he's obsessed with them.\n\nI had a suspicion something was up for a long time based on his profile picture and bio and whatnot, but I didn't really care and didn't do much other than teasing him a couple times. Nor did I have proof. But over the past year or so, things got way worse. This was when he discovered how to sound like an anime girl on voice calls using a real time ai voice changer, which he uses when people other than us are present (he doesn't use it with us but has shown it to us) And it was also when I noticed a shift.\n\nWe used to voice call with another close friend (20m) and play games together, hell we used to do everything together, daily. But he's been ghosting us, canceling plans, etc... and spending what little time he does spend with us, and way more, with that particular person and their friend group. I understand part of this is just getting older and busier, and part of it is wanting to be around different people and so on, which is why I didn't dig into it until now. But that's clearly not the whole story anymore.\n\nNow, I will admit, I am not perfect. At the start, I was just upset and maybe even jealous that he's dodging us and hanging out with another group. So I did a morally bad thing looking into his personal life, past, interests, whatever. But at this point, I'm too concerned and confused to care. It's probably not even my place to say or do anything. But I'm afraid if I don't, I will lose a friend and I'm also afraid I'll lose a friend if I DO do something.\n\nFinally, I'm just wondering where to go from here. Is what he's doing wrong? He's basically deceiving those people no? Why is he doing this? Maybe he's closeted gay/trans and just figuring out/expressing his identity? Should I confront him about it? Should I expose the truth to those people/his parents (not really an option Cuz I'm no snitch) I've asked him before why he does this, and he just said \"they know I'm a guy\" (almost definitely a lie) He also refused to introduce me to his friend group, without stating a reason. I also have the option of naturally getting close to those people, maybe, and just letting my friend decide if he wants to keep up the act or confront me first. I'm just afraid if I do anything radical he's going to cut me off or, even worse, do something to himself. At the end of the day, he's my friend and I care about him and I don't want to do anything that would harm him or ruin our friendship.",

        "text": "Myself (N) 20F studying medicine away from home, I made 2 friends(S &G)who happened to be my roommates. We vibed well and we were inseparable used to share everything with each other. After our classes started 2 more friends (both boys R&F) joined us and we 5 used to hang tough only in class and around the campus. Myself and friend 1 got in relationship w diff guys ( I got with a senior and she with one of our classmates) everything was normal till this point. Friend 1 (s)used to go out with her bf and same with me. No one had a problem, we didn\u2019t neglect friend 2 (girl roomate(g)) we used to bring her with us so it will be more like double date & friend 2. We both were cautious abt not letting her feel like a third wheel and our bfs understood it too so they didn\u2019t mind it much. We kinda don\u2019t like R (boy 1) cuz he\u2019s somewhat arrogant and opportunist and throws anyone under the bus for his own needs. G definitely doesn\u2019t like R she\u2019s been very vocal abt it. Suddenly R asks G out for a date which G accepts but only with the intention of friendship. R was like \u201cit\u2019s a normal outing don\u2019t think too much Im not making a move on you.Dont let N & S know about this\u201d G tells this us to us and we were like it\u2019s your choice and she went. After that everything just started to shift G didn\u2019t even talk properly w us. We didn\u2019t make it an issue but both S and myself were wondering what happened why is she giving us cold shoulder. And G & R kinda make it obvious that they are seeing each other but they didn\u2019t tell anyone. It was our assumption. G slowly stopped talking w me but she was in good talking terms w S. I didn\u2019t mind it because Ik R doesn\u2019t like me that much there\u2019s smthg like coldwar vibes w him. He has that male ego if you avoid him once he\u2019ll be like who is she and start cursing tf out. I could sense that R was influencing G. G completely stopped talking w me and I didn\u2019t bother to fix it. G started to show off like R gave me this we went here, there it costs around sm. I personally stopped caring about G after this one incident where S asked about a cafe that G visited with R to which G was like it\u2019s a good place but it\u2019s too pricey I don\u2019t think you can afford it that irked me in someway and I avoided both R & G completely this goes for 2 months and I planned to move out of the dorm to a diff dorm as it was near to clg as well as my bf\u2019s place. S & G wasn\u2019t okay with it and tried to convince me in staying in same room w them which worked and I stayed w them for another month. Suddenly G calls me and like let\u2019s switch to that dorm, I was like if S is okay with shifting Im ready too. Then G asks S but S doesn\u2019t want to shift, G calls me and tells me S won\u2019t be coming what shall we do, I heard from officials that our dorm is going to be shut down so let\u2019s better move here asap and me believing it moved w her leaving S behind. After moving G started talking w me like before and started to backbite S which I didn\u2019t mind much about I js nodded and went on w my work. G told me that S said smthg bad abt me and G to her new roommate and someone told it to G so she\u2019s Sharing that a me believing that I stopped talking w S on the Cls and avoided her. But G was still talking w everyone atp. I had a small misunderstanding w R in Cls and from then G started to give me cold shoulders. I didn\u2019t care much actually. Both R&G went one step ahead and started to spread some bad lies about me to everyone incl S. everyone in the Cls I know avoids me and was going around the clg like a loner used to talk only w my bf. And few girls in that one girl told me that it\u2019s because of G you\u2019re like this she and R did you so bad behind your back that\u2019s why you are isolated. Now Im with these 4 girls and not talking w any of them. I reconnected w S but she prefers and believes G more. It\u2019s S birthday today she invited me but didn\u2019t text me the place so I didn\u2019t go, but G & R were there. Now Im left alone feeling like a clown. I don\u2019t even know what I did to be isolated like this\u2026",

        "text": "I'm a 25F asking for an opinion. Last year, I met a 28F colleague with whom I became very close, to the point of us spending entire week-ends together. I'm sparing lots of details, but I've noticed things that somehow make me doubt her even though when we're together, it feels like she does value me. She knows how sensitive and fragile I am. Months after we became friends, she started to tease me in public, even once put me down, which she never does with the other people we're also close to, who are older than me. There's one week-end in particular that made me question everything. I remember I came to help her for a personal matter. She knew I didn't want to be alone with her children and I had even once refused to keep them. When I woke up in the morning, I found out she had left me alone with her two kids (a 4 year old girl and a 2 year old boy who were awake) but thankfully she came back later. The following Monday, when she was in front of others, it was as though she didn't care about me and she even started to give me orders (I couldn't act out because it was at work). She likes to brag about what she did for other people, and even told me \"I did X for you and you couldn't do Y for me\" in the presence of others. Now, whenever she does something for me, I feel like it's not genuine but more to full her ego and to be known as the good person. Lately, at work, she became friends with someone who disrespected me a lot and praises her in front of me. I'm not possessive at all, but I don't know what to make of her praising someone she knows I had issues with, if she calls herself my friend. What do you guys think about alleged friends we make at work ? Are there red flags that justify my doubts ? Thank you for reading and for your answers. ",

        "text": "So for context, I have a friend that I am emotionally close to. She's the first real friend I ever made. I go to her for my problems, with my achievements and everything else in between. I tell her every little thing that happens with me. I like spending time with her and at first I thought everything was mutual that we were on the same page. She would come to me for help and advise as well, we would spend time together, cry together, call, text and just talk. \n\nShe's older than me so she graduated first and moved away. And now I've noticed that it's not the same anymore between us like I still want to share things with her and I do but it feels like she doesn't want the same. She doesn't tell me things anymore and not just the deep stuff, the little things as well, everyday things that she would usually tell me I now find out about through our mutual friends. To me she'll say that everything is okay but our friend will tell me that she's going through a hard time and even she is suprised when I say I don't know anything. Everytime I learn that something is going on I try to ask her, not directly, just generally, if everything's okay or if she wants to talk to me, but she'll always say she's okay and that she'll tell me if something were to ever happen. It's happened so many times that now it's too frustrating for me to handle and idk what to do.\n\nThen there's the fact that she doesn't have the time for me anymore, I will text her something but won't get a reply for hours while at the same time she'll be texting or calling with our mutual friend  who will be right next to me. And I get it, she has a life and more important things going on but do I suddenly not matter anymore? \n\nI did try talking to her about it once, I told her I don't feel like I'm as important to her anymore. She told me that's not the case and she would try to be there for me and reply to me more often. And she did for a while but then it was the same again. I haven't brought the topic up again because then it feels like I'm begging for her attention. And now whenever I want to text her I second guess myself. Am I being too much? Is this annoying? Does she even want to talk to me? I just don't know what to do about this situation anymore, can someone give me some advise?",

Yes they are invited to hangouts and we have other friends he could hangout with.

        "text": "Hi everyone, as the title says, I just need to write down a few thoughts about this situation. If I\u2019m in the wrong, feel free to say so. maybe I just need a different perspective.\n\nI\u2019ll try to keep it short: I met this girl ten years ago. We grew close because we both have quite reserved, complex personalities. She was clearly struggling with depression, although she only recently got a formal diagnosis and started treatment.\n\nSo no, we weren\u2019t exactly rays of sunshine... but we got along well. For a while, we did things together, like walks and sport, but after some time she got discouraged and gave up.\n\nAs time went on, we started planning trips and things like that. We went on one trip together, and it went pretty well. The following year I tried suggesting more plans, but she turned them all down, saying it was because of money or because of distance (which, looking back, I now know were just excuses).\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve kept suggesting we do something together, even j ust a few days away or even a simple outing. but she always said no. Even just a few months ago, I invited her to a day at a spa, and again she said no because of the cost. (Which wasnt much... But I didn't insist) I feel the need to do something different because when we hang out we always do the same things in the same places, and we talk (complain) about the same old problems in our life. Even travelling to a nearby city to try a new restaurant is something she won't do.\n\nThen, a few years ago, she started a long-distance relationship, and now her boyfriend is coming to visit. He's flying into our country, and she told me they had booked a B&B so they wouldn\u2019t have to travel right after he landed (which made perfect sense to me)\n\nBut today I found out that the one night in the city has turned into a whole week exploring the city and nearby areas. And apparently, they\u2019re planning more trips this summer.\n\nI know that what she and I have is a friendship, and with him it\u2019s a romantic relationship and it\u2019s not the same thing. But I\u2019ve been in her life for ten years, and he only showed up a couple of years ago. I\u2019ve helped her in every way I could, and I\u2019ve seen her through her darkest times. I spent hours on the phone listening to her complain about how emotionally distant he is.\n\nAnd now\u2026 I just feel really disappointed. Over the years, I\u2019ve tried to walk away from this friendship at least twice, but she clung to it like her life depended on it. Why? If she doesn\u2019t actually enjoy spending time with me, why not just let me go\u2014peacefully?\n",

        "post-author": "Sonny-Side-Up",
        "text": "Ok I\u2019m going to try to keep this not too long. I am a twin (both females) and we are as close as anyone could be. We had a best friend from childhood (met in kindergarten and we are 33 now). We\u2019ve been through a lot together - elementary through high school, college and first jobs, her dad passing, weddings, etc. \n\nThe friendship ended a few years ago over something I thought was really stupid. The best friend accused my twin sister of credit card fraud. We shared an Amazon account (it was my account and I let them use it) and my twin sister accidentally charged something to her the bff\u2019s credit card. Long story short they both felt like the other needed to apologize (one for making the accusation and the other for thinking it was true). I stayed in touch with the bff for a little while but I ultimately stopped because my twin spiraled into a depression after being accused and the bff not believing her. She struggled with dyslexia and it\u2019s the first time it impacted her personal life (usually showed up in school and work) and it hit her hard. I ultimately couldn\u2019t see my twin sister struggle anymore and I reached out to the bff when we were still in touch and told her how hard of a time she was having and how life is too valuable it\u2019s not worth being upset. I begged her to reach out but she didn\u2019t. So that\u2019s when I pulled the plug. I felt like if someone is telling you that someone is that depressed and you could help but decide not to, it isn\u2019t someone who I want to be friends with. When our grandmother died the bff reached out to everyone in my family but my twin. And of course this was with my twin who I would protect at all costs. It was confusing because the bff was always someone who would help other people. My twin is too. \n\nI should note that the relationship was a bit rocky before the whole instance because she married someone who we really didn\u2019t life (emotionally abusive, manipulative). We knew it would be a challenge maintaining the same level of friendship with him permanently in the picture but tried to be supportive. We were her co-maid of honors at their wedding. \n\nOver the years there have been many instances where I\u2019ve wanted to reach out. I had a hard time for a while when the friendship ended but have since not really struggled with it. Now I occasionally (maybe once every several months) have dreams where we reconnect and resolve things and when I wake up is when I miss what we had. Today I took a nap and had a dream with her father who passed in it and it was the most vivid dream I\u2019ve had in a long time. Her mom who is still living somehow retrieved him and walked through a door and we were completely shocked, hugged, and cried so happily. I\u2019m not religious and I haven\u2019t thought about him in an afterlife but I did see a medium once so now I\u2019m wondering what this dream meant. \n\nThe bff had two kids since and it feels like it\u2019s just been too long and too much life has passed. I know the advice I would give someone else but I just can\u2019t seem to follow it. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t want to have regrets 30 years from now. But I also feel like too much has happened and we\u2019re different people now. If we met today, I don\u2019t think we would attract one another as friends. I have many different kinds of friends but are values are quite different and when we were younger it wasn\u2019t as apparent or as important. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice? ",

        "text": "I (27NB) have been getting more and more frustrated with a friend (26F) of mine. We met at work and have known each other for two years but have gotten quite close in the past year. I consider her one of my best friends. We hang out often, are there for each other during bad times, etc the usual friendship stuff. I love and care for her deeply but lately I feel that has changed and I don't know if it's a final straw situation or just accepting this is one of her quirks or what. This is what\u2019s been on my mind lately:\n\n* Canceling plans last minute, sometimes with zero updates... one time just straight up not showing up. This has happened a couple times earlier this year as well. One of these instances effecting multiple people involved in these plans and making birthday gifts for a mutual friend.\n* Consistently being late with planned meet ups. Not more than 10 minutes and just more so a personal pet peeve I guess but still slightly frustrating of my time not being respected, especially when these plans are made in advance.\n* Completely Ignoring certain texts but responding to other text threads we are in. This isn't the first time my texts were ignored too. I'm not just sending stupid memes, some of this stuff I feel warrants a response whether it\u2019s sending updates on projects we\u2019re working on, asking a question, or venting some frustration about things we have talked about before. Earlier this year I had to go through another person to try and form plans with her. That felt humiliating as fuck especially when that other person got an instant response.\n\nNow I know everyone is busy and has their own shit going on or maybe the genuinely forget. That I will always acknowledge and won't get mad if a response is delayed because of that... hell I do that sometimes. However I feel SOME text, no matter how short, is warranted... especially since we are quite close (and I know she truly isn't THAT busy all the time). Most people I know get back to me in at least a day. With her it can be anywhere from within the hour to none at all. Like I don\u2019t say this in a demanding way but in a mutual respect way if that makes sense? It also hurts seeing replies to other text threads we're in and whatnot but not these. And to top it off she's vented to me about flakey partners and friends too so sometimes I'm just like look in a mirror?\n\nI have talked about this issue with her before and we came to an understanding but it's gotten back to being like this. Mutual friends have noted these patterns as well and have expressed frustration at times but they sum it up as one of her personality quirks. Right now I am just returning the favor and matching energy, and essentially lowering the tier of our friendship but is that being petty? Like is it even worth it to accept the gamble of getting decent communication?\n\nI also forgot to add we work at the same job and see each other at least twice a week at work. Chilling outside of work happens once a week to once every other week depending on how busy we both are. I feel no hurt if we can't do anything that week since we do see each other at work anyways. I also tend to wait in person to talk if I know I\u2019ll see her the next day, but if not I text.",

        "text": "I\u2019m 23F. Back in college (when I was 21), I grew close to a guy and eventually developed feelings for him. We used to hang out a lot , movies, dinners, art exhibits - almost like dates, though no one besides my close friends knew about it. I never thought I\u2019d confess, but on graduation day, I took the leap. We were somewhere between friends and maybe something more.\n\nHe told me he wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship, gave me a bunch of vague excuses and then, right after college, he got together with someone who had just turned 18. He even used that to taunt me and kept me emotionally hooked by lying about moving away and how I\u2019d never see him again. None of it was true. My anxiety spiked, and I decided to cut him off completely.\n\nLater, I found out he\u2019d told classmates I was \u201cobsessed\u201d with him and used to get him flowers, when in reality, I gave him\u00a0*one*\u00a0single flower once, just because I thought it might be the last time we met. I genuinely cared about him, but after the lies and emotional manipulation, I knew I couldn\u2019t stay in touch.\n\nNow here\u2019s where it gets more complicated. I had a mutual college friend - a girl he\u00a0*hated*\u00a0and used to talk shit about constantly. She\u2019s someone who has never really been single and tends to prioritize romantic partners over friendships. During the time I was at my lowest, she wasn\u2019t really there for me.\n\nI told her multiple times I didn\u2019t want to hear updates about this guy because she\u2019s in touch with his circle. But she\u2019d keep bringing him up, either directly or indirectly every time we met, even while talking smack about him. It felt unnecessary and even a little intentional. Like, if not out of consideration for\u00a0*me*, shouldn\u2019t she at least have enough self-respect not to stay involved with someone who hated her?\n\nI cut her off for over six months. But later, I softened and started checking in once every month or two, especially since she has no friends in the city anymore. Recently, I met her again and she told me she\u2019s going to\u00a0*his sister\u2019s wedding*. A sister she doesn\u2019t even know personally. It stung. Not because I\u2019m pining, but because... why? Why even go? Is it for drama? To see if I\u2019ll react?\n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s genuinely a friend or just trying to get under my skin. I used to think it was harmless, but now I\u2019m not so sure. Is it just me being sensitive, or is this weird and boundary-crossing?",

        "text": "This is technically a story and it\u2019s kinda long but it\u2019s because it\u2019s so noisy and messy and I\u2019m honestly just trying to get my thoughts in order here, because I\u2019m so emotionally scrambled by this whole situation that I no longer know what\u2019s real or what I\u2019m overthinking.\n\nI\u2019ve had a long-term friendship (4+ years) with someone I\u2019ll call \u201cD.\u201d We were close \u2014 roommates at one point \u2014 and shared a lot of mutual friends. But the dynamic has grown increasingly manipulative and one-sided over the past year, and now I\u2019m at a breaking point. (Honestly, im also inclined to believe that it has always been this one-sided the more I look into it). \n\nTHE CONTEXT:\n\nLast year, I went through the worst financial crisis of my life. My father quit his job and didn\u2019t tell anybody until he physically could not financially support me without warning, and I suddenly found myself in thousands of dollars of rent and utilities debt \u2014 all under D\u2019s name, because it was his account on the lease. As an international student in the U.S., I couldn\u2019t just pick up any job \u2014 it had to be related to my field (filmmaking), which made repaying the debt even harder. I eventually paid him back in full, but I did a terrible job at communicating during the crisis because I was ashamed and overwhelmed.\n\nLike could you imagine being ashamed and embarrassing for a whole year? This was a huge shift in my own journey in the US and journey in my own life; it just felt that everything I had been building had been thrown away just because my dad couldn\u2019t sit me down and communicate with me in time to actually make a workable plan for the future (even if that meant going back home, you know? That conversations just never happened). I was basically depressed and suicidal and the only reason I hadn\u2019t k*lled myself was because I thought, \u201cI cannot, in good consciousness, leave D with this debt.\u201d I asserted myself to paying everything back because of how unfair and stressful the whole situation was not only for myself but for D, too. \n\nThat part is on me. I didn\u2019t communicate well. I emotionally shut down. I take full ownership of that \u2014 and I\u2019ve told him this. I\u2019ve apologized for this and he kinda told me, \u201cThat\u2019s not enough.\u201d\n\nHowever, what\u2019s complicated is that when I finally did try to talk to him about all the passive-aggressive comments and subtle jabs he\u2019s made since, instead of owning any of his behavior, he just used the conversation to bring up his resentment about the debt \u2014 as if that justified everything he\u2019s done.\n\nMost of this behaviour has unfolded in a weird little triangulation situation he created between us and a girl we both met at the beginning of the year and who we both had feelings for. There\u2019s a lot to the story cause this spans from like January this year but I guess I should have realized this a while ago bc it all started like later Feb during what I now call \u201cThe Parley\u201d for ease:\n\nI noticed D was subtly angling for her attention, and it felt weird, especially because we\u2019d already had a prior conversation where he joked about being \u201cshark bait\u201d and \u201cstealing her from me\u201d if I didn\u2019t act soon. I found this as some stupid bit boy piece trying to encourage me to talk to her. But I did call him out, saying something like, \u201cBro, you\u2019re already talking to someone else \u2014 why do you need to insert yourself into this too?\u201d He avoided the question. Kept joking around.\n\nSo later, when the vibe between this girl and I got stronger (we were definitely flirting all weekend), I approached him directly and said: \u201cHey, if something\u2019s going on between you two, I\u2019ll step back. I\u2019m not trying to cross a line.\u201d I even went into detail on how that\u2019s not what I\u2019m about. Instead of clarity, he gave me a performance.\n\nHe responded by suggesting we form an \u201cagreement\u201d \u2014 that neither of us should give this girl the energy she \u201cclearly wants from both of us.\u201d His words, not mine. He basically said \u201cno contact\u201d, let\u2019s see what he does when we don\u2019t feed it. He said we should hold each other \u201caccountable\u201d at parties. He talked about her like she was a manipulative player, not a human being \u2014 and like we were two generals forming a ceasefire over someone\u2019s body.\n\nThen he ended the conversation with:\n\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll guide you where you need to be.\u201d\n\nI should\u2019ve called that out on the spot. I didn\u2019t. I yes-and\u2019d him because I was curious what else he\u2019d say. That\u2019s on me. But I was also just simply shocked and couldn\u2019t believe whether it not he did have so little respect for his friend for the last 4 years. Also, I barely knew this girl, the likelihood of believing her over my best friend? \n\nI\u2019m 25F and he\u2019s 23M for context, btw. Idecided that if he wanted to play games, he can play games. And if she was the person who wanted that kind of attention, then cool, not my vibe. So I stepped back. I didn\u2019t confront. I didn\u2019t say anything more. I just let it play out. I also just gave back the energy I received. But inside, I felt disgusted \u2014 not just by what he said, but that he felt entitled to set the terms for my feelings and this girl\u2019s autonomy.\n\nThat was the first time I realized D didn\u2019t see me \u2014 or her \u2014 as fully real people. And honestly I should have held him to that then. Bc there\u2019s so much more to this story that I\u2019ll try to condense in Bullet points:\n\n\u2022 He defs broke the agreement behind my back AND admitted it on a drunken spiral on my birthday (of all days). He went behind my back and started talking to her (to such an extent that his ex kept telling me, \u201coh, don\u2019t even try. Give it up. She\u2019s just playing games. She\u2019s also gotten along with D.\u201d). He planned events with her that excluded myself and my roommates (I assume because he didn\u2019t want me to know).\n\n\u2022 Created an inside joke with the whole group when she called him \u201cmysterious\u201d while they were talking. Ie: He started rubbing it in my face that he was \u201cmysterious\u201d. Nobody would tell me where this came from but would laugh along with him and he claimed \u201cthe universe\u201d. I realized what he was doing when I asked some mutual friends, explained how it felt and they rolled back on it bc they realized how fucked up that was. \n\n\u2022 I learnt from other people that he told her I \u201cfall in love with everyone,\u201d and implied I was too serious and emotionally intense, even though he knows how I actually feel about relationships. He framed me as the problem while making himself look like the \u201cfun\u201d option. He also told her that if she decides to go for me, she should either look for a relationship or \u201centertain me\u201d \n\n\u2022 He\u2019s apparently been telling everyone that he planned my birthday party, even though mutual friends did that \u2014 not him. His only inclusion was convincing me to put a Diddy joke on my invite even tho I was uncomfortable about it. Again, I\u2019m female, non-binary, gay, a POC; I\u2019m basically \u201cthe bottom of the barrel\u201d and he said, and I quote, \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who can make that joke and no one will get offended.\u201d \n\n\u2022 I\u2019m now hearing that I ruined his birthday by getting upset about his \u201cDiddy\u201d party theme. He forced me to include a Diddy joke in my own birthday invite, but now acts like I was fine with the joke when it served me, and hypocritically upset when it didn\u2019t. For the record, he didn\u2019t even invite me to the party and the only reason I knew about Diddy was bc six people on his party GC told me about it and about how upset they were about it. \n\n\u2022 Did a bunch of weird temperature checks to see if I was still texting her or not, including ripping the phone out of my hand because I stopped answering him when he insistently kept asking me, \u201cwho are you texting.\u201d Even tho I already told him, \u201cNone of your business.\u201d\n\n\u2022 He got upset with me for playing peacemaker when her and another mutual friend got into a fight about semantics. \n\n\u2022 He pretended to throw me off the balcony without warning simply bc I was talking to said girl at my own housewarming party.\n\nThere\u2019s more (again this spans from January to now) but are more contextual to stories and experiences to understand and I don\u2019t want to go on a tangent. Despite all of this, D continues to tell other people in the group that I\u2019m the one who\u2019s \u201cruining everything.\u201d That I\u2019m overdramatic. That I\u2019m turning people against him. That hes \u201cconfused\u201d bc I\u2019m saying stuff about him to other people. When really \u2014 all I\u2019ve done is finally start creating some space for myself.\n\nWHERE I\u2019M AT NOW:\n\nNow I get where the resentment is coming from \u2014 the aforementioned financial strain \u2014 but what I don\u2019t get is why he never talked to me about it? Like we\u2019ve have much worse conversations before? I\u2019ve apologized to him about it multiple times. This just doesn\u2019t makes sense. I\u2019ve come to realize that D exhibits many traits of covert narcissism. I\u2019ve talked to a couple of friends and that\u2019s kinda the conclusion we came to. And that he\u2019s been doing it in subtle ways that predate last year. \n\nHe reframes events to make himself look good. Absolutely hates being made out to be the villain. He undermines others when they outshine him. He avoids accountability until he\u2019s cornered \u2014 and even then, he just deflects. He\u2019s emotionally unsafe. And most of all, he\u2019s been pretending like I am the toxic one, because I finally stopped letting him control the narrative (and bc he can easily use the situation last year to say, \u201csee, she\u2019s a bad person.\u201d\n\nThat said, here\u2019s what I don\u2019t know:\n\u2022 Should I talk to him again \u2014 not to fix the friendship, but to formally close it out?\n\n\u2022 Should I ask how he\u2019d like me to resolve the past financial strain in a way that feels meaningful to him \u2014 even if our friendship is ending?\n\n\u2022 Do I tell him I think he\u2019s a bad person, or do I just name what he\u2019s done and leave it at that?\n\n\u2022 Or do I just walk away without giving him a final word at all?\n\nI worry that ghosting is cowardly \u2014 but I also feel like engaging at all gives him another chance to spin the story. Like hell just feed off the reaction? I want to do the right thing, but the noise in this situation is so loud \u2014 and I know part of that is his design. He thrives in chaos and confusion. It\u2019s how he avoids accountability. So stepping back has been peaceful, but part of me wonders if I\u2019m avoiding a necessary confrontation.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something like this?\nHow do you know when to close a chapter with grace vs. just get the hell out?\n\nAny advice is welcome. I\u2019m exhausted, but I want to grow through this \u2014 not just escape it.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nTLDR: Longtime friend created a weird agreement to not pursue a girl we both liked, but he broke it, lied about it, and manipulated the situation to make me look like the dramatic one. I\u2019ve owned my past mistake of not communicating well during a financial crisis that put strain on him, but he\u2019s used that to justify months of passive-aggression and narrative control. Now he\u2019s telling our friend group I\u2019ve ruined everything, and I don\u2019t know if I should confront him one last time, try to repair the financial damage with closure, or just walk away. I\u2019m exhausted and don\u2019t know what\u2019s the healthy thing to do or even if the healthy thing is also the right thing to do?",

I\u2019m not going to hide behind \u201cit was a bad year.\u201d That debt absolutely impacted him, and I\u2019ve owned that it was one of the biggest mistakes I made in our friendship. I didn\u2019t communicate well during that time, and it created real damage.\n\nI paid him back every penny \u2014 with interest. I was also dealing with immigration limitations, an unstable home life, and no legal access to steady income in the U.S., so it took time. When I moved out, I chose not to reclaim my $2K security deposit so that he could have it. That was my way of taking responsibility beyond words.\n\nThe reason I mentioned the \u201cgirl drama\u201d isn\u2019t to trivialize the debt \u2014 it\u2019s to point out that *after* I made amends and started getting back on my feet, he began treating me like I no longer deserved empathy or boundaries. He only brought up his resentment about the debt after I finally confronted him about how weird and uncomfortable the dynamic around this girl had become. And this came *after* I\u2019d already been trying to rebuild the friendship in good faith for months.\n\nHe used my lowest moment to justify his dishonesty, subtle sabotage, and public framing of me as the problem. I let the guilt eat me alive, and I stayed quiet while he rewrote the story \u2014 because I thought I deserved it. But guilt doesn\u2019t mean I have to stay in a dynamic that\u2019s emotionally unsafe.\n\nWe\u2019ve had harder conversations than this. We\u2019ve talked about more difficult things than this. And yeah, it might *look* like \u201cthis is all about a girl,\u201d but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about how it all unfolded, how it was handled, and how it revealed who he was when he had the power.\n\nSo yeah \u2014 he covered for me. And I\u2019m still grateful for that. But it doesn\u2019t excuse what came after. That's where I'm coming from.",

I really don't see that as a \"power play\" for him. That's 'thousamds of dollars in rent and utilities debt\" was on His name. Do you understand that? not a power play. He either pays that or be is financially ruined. He is 23. That would impact his whole financial future. I think he definitely needs to distance himself from you. you sound ungrateful\n\nto add to this: if he distanced himself from you sooner after all that financial mess you got him in... everything after... would still be irrelevant.\n\nThen he could have still pursued the girl, without having to deal with your drama",

All I\u2019m saying is that, of all the conversations we\u2019ve had about this, it just seems that he is choosing sabotage over talking it through. \n\nEspecially since we have already resolved everything and this seemed to have only came up as a reaction. If he still feels that I\u2019m ungrateful about this, I\u2019d love to sit him down and talk it through, even if it means the friendship is over. Because the right thing would be to resolve this with closure and clarity for him. \n\nIt\u2019s not about whether I feel closure from this because that\u2019s not what I deserve. It\u2019s whether he\u2019s gotten that closure or whether it seems like that\u2019s what he wants or not (given the context). I do respect what you\u2019re saying tho.

        "text": "I met my friends a few years ago, there\u2019s a group of 5 girls, including me. We\u2019ve seen eachother for meets ups a lot, usually consisting of drinking and food.\n\nThe last time we met up, was February. I\u2019ve been having a hard year. I\u2019ve been struggling with my eating disorder and mental health problems, along with grief over my mother passing. I didn\u2019t want to attend the February meet up, but did as my partner said it would be a good distraction for me, and I shouldn\u2019t lose contact with my friends.\n\nIt was awful. I spent the whole night feeling awful, pretending to enjoy myself. The girls were quizzing me constantly asking if I was okay, and why I had been quiet on socials etc. I have confided in 2 of the girls prior to the meet up explaining why I didn\u2019t want to go etc.\n\nWhilst I was In The bathroom, 1 of my friends told the remaining about the problems I was having. This led to another friend cornering me in the bathroom trying to get me to speak about it, which I didn\u2019t want (which is why I confided in my closest 2 friends).\n\n Anyways, one of my closer friends was having problems so I spent the majority of the evening soothing her and trying to keep her from crying etc. just generally trying to be supportive.\n\nTowards the end of the night, when we were leaving, we were walking back to the train station. 2 of the group held back to whisper to each other, refusing to walk alongside us. I was feeling fed up as felt like I was mothering people, because they couldn\u2019t do this or that etc.\n\nI ended up just crying from frustration and how I was feeling. What annoyed me was that only 1 of my friends was supportive. My closest friend, the one who had spent the whole night crying basically, was no where to be found.\n\nThey have plans to meet today for a drink but I\u2019ve decided not to go, and my partner is saying I should go and to not lose contact with them.\n\nThe effort is put in when I text first, or I ask to do something. I don\u2019t receive this back and I feel frustrated.\n\nThese 4 girls are my only friends and I just don\u2019t know what to do",

        "post-author": "4ri4ri",
        "text": "Me and my best friend are currently on a month and a half of barely speaking. Shes was becoming more and more distant for months now and whenever I brought it up she would reassure me it was just because she was busy juggling school and work, which I understood. Im not in school right now but I do work and I can only imagine how it feels doing both. I had a lot of hope that we would go back to normal around May, when she finished school, since she'd be less busy. I was wrong. We went from talking every day, to every other day, to every two, three, four, five days and so on. I decided to give her some space until I straight up asked if I had done something wrong or if she was mad or offended and she replied with something along the lines of \"Nah, I just dont have the energy to text everyday\". That was kind of a vague answer but I replied with a joke and was glad that there was no ill will. I dont know if maybe that was my bad cause she never replied to that, so maybe she wanted me to ask what was wrong? After that short \"conversation\", six days ago, its been complete radio silence on her end. I received some good personal news that I knew she would be happy for me about. Of course I wanted to tell her. What are best friends for, right? But I will admit I had ulterior motives, kind of. I thought if I told her she would at least reply with a congratulations or good for you. This is something I know she would have been excited about before this situation so I kind of used it as bait, but she didn't budge. At first I was a little hurt but I immediately felt guilty afterwards cause I thought what if she's going through a rough patch and Im over here rubbing my good news in her face? That was maybe five days ago and I left it alone, until today. I sent a message asking how she was feeling around half an hour ago and she has yet to reply. Our messages prior to her last one sounded normal, just very short. I sent her a picture of matching keychains I bought us and she said they were cute. I feel like so many signs are pointing in the \"she doesn't want to be my friend anymore\" direction but at the same time I still have hope. We never argue and the only disagreement I can remember us having before this ghosting went into full swing was her saying she was annoyed with me basically. She was right to be though, I had a crush on this girl and I kept mentioning her and giving updates. I know I was being a little obsessive very obnoxious and so went she told me that it was bothering her I immediately said she was right and never mentioned it again. She started off that message with \"You know I love you and Im always here for you...\" and it makes me think, who starts a message off like that to someone they no longer want to be friends with? Exactly, nobody. Maybe this whole thing is her trying to let me go gently, and if so, it's not working. Im afraid something is going on in her personal life. Is she depressed, did she go through a loss, did something traumatic happen to her? She knows Im always there for her so if something did happen and she feels like she cant tell me than it must be something really bad. Im really worried not just about our relationship but her. Obviously, shes been my best friend for a decade, I like when she's happy. Im gonna continue giving her space but Im afraid if I pull back shes gonna take that as me being mad or something. Everyone Ive talked to about this is pointing the finger at her. Saying she sounds mean and maybe she decided she was too good for me, or saying that sometimes people just switch on you from night to day. Im having a hard time believing that because shes such a genuine and sincere person. She's one of the realest most down to earth people I know. I would say maybe other people are seeing something in her that Im not, but I refuse to believe that she would do me, or anyone, this dirty. Any advice helps because Im at a standstill. Do I let her go? Do I press her? Do I wait for her? How can I let her know that Im not ready to throw a decade of friendship down the drain over seemingly nothing? If anyone has ever been in a similar situation, how did it end up? Did you mend the friendship or go different ways? ",

They like you bc you are nice to them and most people feel more connected to people that they don\u2019t really care about that much by just liking their story or commenting on their post that\u2019s about as far as they\u2019ll go on their part with you. But if you feel like you are always the one reaching out more when it comes to going beyond the surface level and they just don\u2019t seem that interested then that simply means they don\u2019t care about you as much as they should. It\u2019s not even a you problem it\u2019s a them problem tbh. I was just like you always reaching out to people especially after they would comment or dm or stop me in person to tell me how beautiful I looked and how much they missed me. As soon as I would respond back and proceed to have a nice conversation with them or text them after 3 mins they\u2019d just completely ghost me and wouldn\u2019t respond back until I posted again and sometimes they\u2019d just like the message they wouldn\u2019t even text back. They would literally never show any genuine interest in me or my life besides giving me a compliment and then ghosting me. And the times I\u2019ve implied hanging out some of them made it sound like they were too busy or they \u201cdidn\u2019t mind\u201d doing it but made it almost sound like an obligation instead of something they wanted to do. I\u2019ve also had people where I would try to imply hanging out and they acted like if their other friend didn\u2019t want to go with them or if someone else wasn\u2019t with them they basically just ghosted bc they weren\u2019t interested. Every birthday I had the same people I showed up for usually never showed up for mine\ud83d\udc80. I ended up deleting all of my social media and now I only have YouTube bc I got so sick of it all it\u2019s just so negative and so weird. I didn\u2019t tell anyone or iniate anything I just fell back. Not a single person, not even one of who I thought were my \u201cfriends\u201d has not even once texted to check up on me or anything. That\u2019s literally just how majority of this generation is. A lot of people aren\u2019t interested in friendships or any relationship with people like that anymore if they aren\u2019t already in some, and if they do actually show interest in others and not you I find that it\u2019s usually because that person they just became friends with has clout and seems popular and always going out to clubs or doing what our generation calls the new norm of \u201cfun\u201d which is literally getting drunk and clubbing. I\u2019m not one of those people anymore.  I do however like to have fun so it will be other things just not a club lol. and I\u2019m also a married I woman, (I don\u2019t tell everyone that though, due to the fact of people already being prone to being easily jealous and doing things out of spite, it\u2019s just a protection thing I just tell them I have a man unless I know I can trust they won\u2019t get spiteful) I am young though so the things I do do without my husband will be something that doesn\u2019t cause him to raise eyebrows because I have respect for my relationship. My version of fun is like going to arcades, lazer tag or something along those lines, interactive museums, amusement parks, parks, movies, roller skating with nice music not super overwhelming , food lounges, brunch that\u2019s not super loud and overwhelming, fairs and etc yk those type of things, Im a scary kid at heart. A lot of people really stopped being around me once I really got locked in with my now husband but at the time boyfriend. But even before me and him got together I still struggled to actually have friends that showed an equal amount of interest in me as I did them. Sure you can say we definitely hung out and I was out and about more when I was single than now but I\u2019ve always been an available person to my friends even now. My husband can trust me to go places and not act like I lost it. I\u2019ve tried everything when it comes to making friends and us hanging out but I could never understand why people just legit didn\u2019t fool with me like that. I\u2019ve always been the type to be super outgoing and always considerate like picking my friends up, paying for food, having stuff on hand, always being available for my friends whenever they needed me even in the middle of the night and just showing that I actually cared about them and their wellbeing. I\u2019d even do things I wasnt always interested in only bc my friends liked it and it made them happy. I honestly feel like showing too much kindness also made some friends think they can treat me any kind of way. I also think the nicer and yk if you have a goofy and clumsy personality like mine most people won\u2019t take you serious or kind of underestimate you, and treat you like they are above you bc they may think you are slow, or maybe bc of the big personality they might be embarrassed by it or think it\u2019s something to be embarrassed about. Idk people are definitely becoming meaner by the day. The best advice I can give you is what I\u2019m currently doing for myself which is trying to find enjoyment in solitude. It\u2019s not easy yk because you will feel like you are missing out and you will also feel like nobody cares about you. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to find peace within yourself like treating yourself with care and grace and love. Idk if you believe in God but for me he\u2019s like the best friend I can ask for and a great therapist. I\u2019m also starting my journaling journey as well so I journal and read while talking to him. Find fun in doing things by yourself without having friends or trying to find friends to do it with. Also learn to appreciate the things you have around you. My husband is basically my only friend ofc besides God and anyone else I talk to is more of an acquaintance than a friend. I just appreciate the fact that he sees me not just for my looks but actually sees me and enjoys my company and we do everything together but when he\u2019s not around I just do things that I like to enjoy by myself. I\u2019ll go eat by myself, go watch a movie by myself, take myself out on a date and get all dolled up just for me\ud83d\ude2d. There\u2019s nothing weird about doing things by yourself  and I feel more free doing that rather than being around someone and feeling like I have to be on my best behavior or can\u2019t fully be myself. Hell if I had the money I\u2019ll take a solo trip by myself. Now, I don\u2019t think my husband would like that only bc yk it\u2019s just kind of a man thing\ud83d\udc80he would rather come with me depending on how far I\u2019m going. Just do the things you enjoy for you not for anyone else. Find comfort in doing it alone and someone will eventually notice you without you even having to do anything, that might be just like you and will actually give you the love and respect you\u2019ve been wanting from these meaningless friendships. If those people can\u2019t see that you are worthy and you are definitely a rare gem thats worth keeping, then that\u2019s their loss. They will regret it. That I can promise you, and that\u2019s just from experience. it\u2019s not alot of people out there that are genuinely a kind hearted good person that has a genuine interest in other people besides themselves. So, your absence will leave a mark that they won\u2019t ever forget.",

She also uses \"well, what about me? Look at what I've had to .....\". These comments are always made with a defensive or aggressive tone. \nEvery time she starts something like this, I'm on guard and always try to keep myself placid and share my viewpoints without being attacking in return. \nIt feels like she's deliberately trying to sting me. I just don't get it. I never treat  her like this. I spent today helping her move into a new place - heavy lifting in the rain with an injured wrist.  And I did it happily as I like to help people and I promised her I would. For the last 6-9 months, her reliance on me has grown to the point that she'd be ringing me every day. And I'd listen to her patiently and reassure her when she'd start apologising for talking to much. If i was too quiet, she'd get all huffy and all \"I'm sorry. I'm taking too much. I'll shut up\".  I've never told her to shut up (she's repeatedly told me to shut up). I've never told her that I'm not interested in what she saying. I've never said I can't handle talking to her when she'd is a mood and hanging up on her (she's done that to me).\nShe's very religious and preaches to me. She uses her belief to dismiss my beliefs (ie I like tarot cards and she tells me it's the devils work). When I stood up to her some weeks ago and said I didn't share her beliefs, she started to belittle me and imply that I'll go to hell (for the record, totally fine with that).\nIs this the behaviour of a resentful person or a jealous person or a judgemental person? I'm so tired of it.   ",

I then met a guy who had kids with him (big mistake even looking twice at this guy). I moved house, and we still did those things, just not as often. So, years pass, I then get a message from a mutual friend that Lisa was talking to about me(got screenshots) but ignored it. I ended up getting a job amd finally ending my toxic relationship with the guy and moved on and started seeing someone else and one day I noticed Lisa had deleted me off socal media so I messaged her about it and we talked it out and then she came back to me with this list of things I needed to do/with her like stay over at her house at least one month and talk to her everyday. I was taken back but I did try to make it work and I invited her to comic con and I went as a princess so my dress was long and we were walking up thses stairs and she was behind me and she stepped on my dress and I said \"ahh lisa your stepping on my dress\" she then turns and said my shoe's cost more than your dress but yet again I was taken back and just shrugged it off. Month after that we both went to the cinema and throughout the night she was acting strange and I couldn't wait to go home the next day. So a few weeks passed, and  It was her birthday, so I message went to message her on WhatsApp to wish her happy birthday, but her profile picture was gone. I messaged her anyway, knowing i was blocked, Lisa? And only one tick appeared. I then see she's blocked me on everything. I was so upset the first couple of years I would try and find her, but no luck, but now I'm not so upset about how the friendship ended. Now and I try and look her up just to see how life is treating her smiling at all the good memories we had together and something dawns on me to look at another friend profile we both know and look at her friends and behold I find Lisa's Instagram. lisa looks good and happy. I just don't know why I kept looking for her, tbh Maybe it's because I didn't get to say my peace,and wonder if she ever thinks about me but I do wish her the best in life. \n\n",

        "text": "I live in the UK in a pretty rural area where everyone knows everyone and  all friendship kind of groups are already established. My friendship group is pretty small it used to be bigger but we are just a group of three. I have another friend out with this group who i also work with every day but she is a pretty busy person in general. I have another one who moved away that i see every couple months too.\n\nFor about the last 6-8 months i have just felt like a burden to the two friends i mainly go out with. We have even been on holiday before etc and would go out most weekends obviously not all but now i feel if i don\u2019t make the plans there just never will be any.\n\nOne of them recently got a boyfriend and she is the type that kind of forgets about her mates the moment she gets one. The other has had a boyfriend for a few years now however its never stopped them from hanging out before. Im not the type that gets mad when people are doing stuff with their significant other but all of a sudden it just feels like we never hang out.\n\nThe one that had a boyfriend for years we will call Julie. She has got a dog at the end of last year so i get that becomes more tying as i have two dogs myself but it just feels like something has changed even slightly before the dog like she was that kind of person who always wanted to go out now i feel like I\u2019m almost begging and if i don\u2019t pop up and ask then just she would never pop up again. Even when we have gone out in the last couple months she is glued to her phone and the thing that hurt most was she missed my birthday. I get it birthdays aren\u2019t big deals really once you get older but she always makes hers such a big song and dance yet couldn\u2019t even make mine. She was working that day but finished at 4 and the party wasn\u2019t till 7 anyway. I had also been working before hers and still managed to make it. That day just made me feel like billy no mates and the more time goes on i am just starting to feel more and more bitter about it.\n\nI have asked if shes okay , are there any problems etc but just plays dumb whenever i bring it up. When we used to go out there was this guy at our local bar she seemed to have a bit of a slight thing crush with (forget to say shes an occasional cheater but plays happy families online) however he got a girlfriend who did not like him hanging out with her since she would send flirty messages to him all the time which i understand. So i don\u2019t know if shes avoiding the bar due to that. I brought that up to her before in a niceish way but she just denied there was any issue.\n\nWe are all 23 i get people are getting older and settling down and i don\u2019t know if i am just immature but i feel I\u2019m just spending my weekends alone and have nobody. It\u2019s so hard to branch out somewhere rural like here as everyone knows everyone and all friendships are already kind of fully formed. Im at a brink where i just want some new friends but they\u2019re so hard to find. I just wish it was the way it was even a year ago i felt like i was in a good group now i feel so alone.\n\nIm at a point i don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I get a mixture of sadness and anger when i think about it all",

Whether it\u2019s where I\u2019m going, school, internal life, dating etc. I just don\u2019t see the point in it. People around me get upset with me and take it personal when I don\u2019t share anything that\u2019s deep and personal. It is always superficial stuff like what I like to eat, favorite color, or tv show. The reason as to why I do it is because people tend to have an intention to help but always end up projecting, trying to control you, or make it about them. My response to the irritation it is always from a place of confusion in terms of like \u201cwhy do you care?\u201d \u201cwhat does this have to do with you?\u201d or \u201chow does this impact your life?\u201d. For example, If i had someone who kept a partner in secret for a while, i wouldn\u2019t get too offended because I could still do research and show up for my friend.

Literally, she sat in front of me during the lecture and didn't even bother to say hi or look at me while she was chatting with another friend (V, the sick girl). They usually secretly gossip about me; both of them met at a place where G (21F) ranted about me to V. The last interaction I had with G was via text, where she asked me to accompany her to a friend's house who was sick. But I knew the sick girl (V) doesn't like me visiting, so I directly texted her and asked if I could visit. She asked how I knew, and I said G told me. V then texted back saying no need. So, I texted back to G saying no, sorry, I cannot accompany you. Then G texted back asking why, and I didn't want to tell her about the whole conversation with V, as it would sound like I'm gossiping about her. I genuinely didn't know what to reply, so I thought I'd talk to her face-to-face when we met next. But before I could do so, these things happened.\n\n",

        "text": "I\u2019ve completely ghosted a friend of mine recently and I\u2019m wrestling with guilt, even though I feel like it was the right thing to do.\n\nWe\u2019ve had a rocky past. Years ago, she talked badly about me behind my back to multiple people. When I confronted her, she apologized, and I chose to forgive her. But I never trusted her again. Since then, I kept my distance , I was respectful, but I stopped telling her anything personal.\n\nThen I recently found out something that honestly sealed the deal for me.\n\nWe have a mutual friend who was in a relationship with a guy. They broke up, and this \u201cfriend\u201d of mine literally went and helped that guy get with someone else , like she set him up. But here\u2019s the thing: she never told the original girl. She\u2019s still following her, still smiling at her face, and that girl has no idea what she did. I only found out through social media and a few quiet conversations.\n\nWhen I remembered how this girl also used to make sneaky, subliminal comments about that same friend\u2019s looks, it hit me how deeply fake she is. She\u2019s the kind of person who will smile at you, act sweet, and then sabotage you behind closed doors.\n\nSo I ghosted her. No announcement, no confrontation, just silence. I don\u2019t want to open the door to excuses, drama, or fake apologies. I just want her out of my life.\n\nBut I can\u2019t lie , a small part of me feels bad. Like maybe I should\u2019ve said something or handled it differently. But honestly? Staying friends with someone like that would\u2019ve been a huge disrespect to myself.\n\nWas ghosting her the wrong move?",

                "body": "I\u2019ve learnt fairly recently that if you ever had respect for the friendship, then you should show that respect at the end, and it makes sense. Additionally, ghosting is a very obvious sign of someone being bad at communication. Also that being a good friend isn\u2019t always just on a case by case basis how you are with someone, it\u2019s also your actions. \n\nI still feel guilty over allowing some connections with people to dwindle through no contact from years ago, and I also still feel hurt by people doing the same to me. \n\nFrom what I can tell from here, you\u2019re feeling bad for not communicating how you felt - I think you\u2019re allowed to very gracefully state that due to deferring values/morals or however you want to put it that you dont think the friendship is working for you anymore, and to thank them for all of the good memories (and mention any particular ones that stand out) - that way you can be proud of what you\u2019ve said and not have any regrets. You could then just block the person if you\u2019re worried about the fallout, but at the same time, you could allow for a response and you can just say something like \u201cthis is why I don\u2019t think this is working anymore\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re allowed to feel that way.\u201d Just keeping it short. But then that also depends on how long you\u2019ve been ghosting this person already, because if you\u2019ve done it for a fair amount of time, then just appearing and saying it could be quite cruel. \n\nI\u2019ve recently sent one (literally 3 days ago) to someone who I was friends with for 11 years and I haven\u2019t received a reply, and at this point, I don\u2019t expect to - but I know that this says a lot about him than me, and tells me he never respected the friendship in the first place\u2026which checks out, haha! \n\nAll we can do is learn, grow and do better. I hope you find peace eventually, and all the very best of luck to you!",

        "title": "Did you mean it when you said \u201cbest friends\u201d?",
        "post-author": "throwaway_rain_check",
        "text": "This is a long read but I could really use some perspective on things. \n\nMy best friend and I (both M, early 20s) used to be pretty close. We texted every day, hung out once per week, and had the kind of friendship where we each felt safe, seen, and could talk about anything and everything. It should be said that we both have trauma, trust issues, and childhood trauma (him more so than me), and generally haven\u2019t had a lot of friends throughout our lives. So it was very special that we both felt safe and that this friendship was very important to us. \n\nAnd then, a few months ago, he started dating someone. I guess the first bit of tension started with him holding off on telling me for a month because he knew I wouldn\u2019t approve, and he\u2019s right of course. Without going much into it, his new relationship is absolutely something that I do not approve of and goes against a lot of my values and boundaries, but I\u2019m also not here to tell my friend how to live his life or impose my values onto his romantic relationships. And more than anything, I just want him to be happy, so that\u2019s what I told him. Personally, my opposition to this new relationship is precisely because I think there\u2019s no way it can make him happy, but it\u2019s his life and he will find out if that\u2019s the case. Not my place to impose. \n\nThen, gradually, we began to text less and less. We hung out less and less. And the vibe changed. My friend felt less present and less interested in my company. It felt like I was less of a priority in his life. A sad, predictable story. \n\nI did not react well. Previously I\u2019ve struggled with anxious attachment (more so in my romantic relationships) but as I felt my friend slipping I had the anxious attachment attack of a lifetime. I was freaking out and panicking about our friendship ending almost every second of the day. I was scrutinizing every interaction for signs that things were either recovering or continuing to slip. It consumed my life and brought my anxiety to a 9/10. I had no idea I could feel these things so strongly, and it scared the hell out of me. It actually prompted me to begin therapy, something I had been holding off on (against my friend\u2019s advice) because I thought I was \u201cfine\u201d. Fortunately, I have very strong self-control and didn\u2019t damage our friendship too badly but I was very annoying to deal with during this time. We have talked thoroughly about this, and my friend knows all about my struggles during this time and has been nothing but supportive. Like I said, he\u2019s the one who\u2019s been encouraging me to go to therapy. \n\nRecently, there has been some major drama (internal and external) in my friend\u2019s relationship with his partner. Out of respect for them I won\u2019t go into it because it\u2019s immaterial to the situation. But it\u2019s bad. Consuming-his-life levels of bad. So we haven\u2019t seen each other in 2 months. We haven\u2019t spoken on the phone for a month and a half. And we haven\u2019t had a real conversation since then. I\u2019ve asked to talk and to hang out, and both of these have gone nowhere. He\u2019s either too busy or too exhausted from relationship drama taking its toll on him. I\u2019ve done my absolute best to be there for my friend and provide support. A lot of the time he doesn\u2019t want it and doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. He even once went so far as to say \u201cdon\u2019t expect me to talk about it\u201d which was a weird thing to say and definitely made me overthink a bunch of stuff. At the same time he always reaches out when things are going badly. I don\u2019t know what to make of it.\n\nUnfortunately it\u2019s been really draining and taxing on me to always be there for my friend when he isn\u2019t there for me. I\u2019ve really been having a rough time lately, but I\u2019ve stopped talking about my problems with him because of all the times he\u2019s been too exhausted to be there for me. I know this is how things go sometimes, but unfortunately one of my core values is fairness/reciprocity and my brain is acutely aware of this imbalance regardless of how much I try to calm it down.\n\nWe\u2019re in this holding pattern of idle chitchat and him coming to me when something goes wrong in his life. We still text a lot (side note, texting is not my preferred method of communication and he knows that), but the quality of the conversation has gone way downhill. And it always takes hours for him to get back to me. He never (seriously, NEVER) asks about my day or my life while I always try and do so if I have the energy. And I would say our expectations or values are unaligned\u2026except it was different in the past. Pre-partner, that is. \n\nI guess\u2026I thought we were on the same page. We both agreed we were best friends, that this was a special friendship we had never experienced before, and that we wanted to be friends for the long run. We agreed it meant a lot to us and that we weren\u2019t going to throw it away. After all we\u2019ve been through, we at least knew we had each other\u2014someone else who understood and wouldn\u2019t treat us like people from our past had. And I guess for me, best friend means you always hold space for that person, no matter how terrible things are going for you right now. It means holding space: partner, no partner; other friends, no friends; family, no family. It\u2019s not an appellation to be given lightly\u2026but we both agreed it wasn\u2019t, and that we were best friends all the same.\n\nI have no other friends I\u2019m as emotionally close with, but this person is my best friend for a reason. We have a great understanding of each other, wonderful rapport, and a deep sense of mutual belonging and respect. I know I should be getting out there and finding new people to focus on while my friend is unavailable, but I feel hurt that my friend is prioritizing a romantic relationship with so many issues over a friendship with all these wonderful qualities. And I just can\u2019t shake this persistent, nagging feeling that our friendship doesn\u2019t mean as much to him as it does to me. \n\nThis is so long and nobody will ever read it, but it\u2019s more of a venting session for myself anyway. I\u2019ve already reached out to my friend asking to have a heart-to-heart about our friendship. He predictably hasn\u2019t responded. And by the way: I know I\u2019m a needy, clingy mess. I\u2019m working on it. But this shit means a lot to me and I would rather be alone than with someone who doesn\u2019t value close friendship as much as I do. ",

        "text": "Hi, so for context I'm 17 and most of my friends are somewhat the same age. (16 or turning 17)\n\nEver since the beginning of the school year my friends have started to ignore me and leave me out, starting with one or two occasionally not talking to me and now it got to the point I didn't go to my graduation because it was most of the group.\n\nI'm upset and quite mad because not only am I not sure I did anything wrong (if I have I'd prefer if they just told me) but also because I've done so many things for them.\n\nFor some context, my mum often drove some of them home or places if they needed, and bought mc Donald's for them, I've always tried to be there for them, if I had sweets at home I'd bring them to school to share, or gave people money if they needed it.\n\nAll this and then they ignore me, when one of the friends, Zoe literally ruined my hair last year by cutting it rlly badly. I forgave her then, bc she apologised and gave me sweets as an apology, yet now she's the one ignoring me the most. She glares at me whenever she talks to me and at youth club (a place I was at first, and invited everyone to join) she ignores me and even pushed me when we were painting bc she needed paint. She only talked to me at a trip we had in school, but only because she needed trousers, and even then she was acting mean, and she gave them back the next day by just putting them on my lap, not even a good morning or hello or thank you.\n\nShe's been ignoring me since a prom like thing, where she texted me that it turned out her friend John was actually going to the prom and she couldn't sit beside me on the bus. The message was said in a way it was my decision but she kept saying in said message how he had begged her to sit with him and how she'd feel really bad for him if he sat alone.\n I ended up being the one who sat alone on the bus. Both of the ways. I was ignored by her at the prom thing too and was getting left out a good bit but thankfully a different friend noticed and included me with her. \n\nZoe's best friend, Nancy, has kind of been a part of this, as she's around Zoe but hasn't spoken up to her or me about it all, and she's also been a part of it slightly. \n\nI can wrote abt my other friend in the comments if needed. Either way I'm going into senior years next year, and I've already had a horrible year because of this, but some of them do talk to me, like Nancy talked me to yesterday at youth club but Zoe and John weren't there so I feel like that's why. \n\nMost of the friends didn't notice when I wasn't in for graduation except 1 person (the one who included me at the prom), and when I got to see Hamilton and didn't tell most except a few, Nancy talked to me a week after I was gone to tell me \"she heard from someone I got to see Hamilton \"\n\nI don't know what to do because I'm mad how they treat me but when they actually start talking to me and being nice I don't dare bring it up.

She gets to make the final decision on what she gets to do (fields trips and such) but doesn't pay for anything despite being very wealthy.\n\nThe thing is, even though I have collected evidence of her bad parenting, I don't know if she knows that he mom is a bad parent or what to do about it. I assume her dad could fight for more custody but he is not financially well off and so he probably can't afford to take her to court. Another option would be family counseling but her mother doesn't believe in therapy.\n\nWhat should I do?",

I went home last Wednesday, May 28, 2025 to my parent's house and so did she. So on that Wednesday morning, she was the last to leave the dorm and did not turn off the bathroom light. I went back to the dorm on Thursday evening to get some of my stuff, and to my disappointment I saw that the bathroom lights were still on. She had this habit of not turning off the lights ever since and she does not unplug as well some of the sockets. She has already apologized but I still cannot find it in my heart to forgive her. I think my hatred for her accumulated over the many times she has annoyed me. \n\nI need advice please. How do I find it in my heart to forgive her? We have been friends since college :((",

        "text": "My friend, Wendy, is 38 and has been dating her fianc\u00e9, Jason, for 10 years. Jason is 49. \n\nWendy and Jason got engaged on 12/13/23. \n\nAlso in December 2023, Jason started exhibiting abusive behavior. He threw the engagement ring at Wendy before proposing and told her everything he hates about her, locked her out of the apartment, threw a bagel at her windshield like a child, and hit her in the face with a water bottle (supposedly on accident). \n\nApparently Jason is an alcoholic and had a bad month but Wendy told me over the 10 years he has waves of alcoholism where he is abusive. She told me he gets better and then relapses and then repeats his abusive behavior. \n\n9 months out from Wendy's wedding, she asked me to be a bridesmaid and I say No because Jason is abusive and I do not support the wedding. She tells me she exaggerated everything about Jason. I tell her I don't believe that she exaggerated it and that I'm concerned for her safety. She gets mad and tells me that if I don't want to be a bridesmaid she understands and will respect my decision. I tell her in good conscience that I cannot be a bridesmaid. She starts screaming at me and telling me that I'm a liar and I have made up everything about Jason in my head. \n\nI decide to look into Jason's past and find a domestic battery conviction. I do a public records request and when I receive it I am shocked. Not only is the police report things I have heard Wendy say and text me but also Jason apparently threatened to kill his and his ex girlfriend's baby.\n\nOn top of that Wendy told me that Jason said he couldn't stick around if there was something health wise wrong with their baby (mind Wendy is 38 and Jason has waited 10 years to propose) knowing it's a higher probability of a woman having issues with pregnancy. \n\nSo not only has he threatened to not stick around he has already proven he won't stick around. \n\nWendy is very angry with me and continues to verbally attack me about how shitty of a friend I am. \n\nNow Wendy is making false accusations about my marriage, saying that she thinks I'll cheat on my husband. \n\nI'm obviously angry that she's making these false accusations but I also understand she is angry and may be making rash decisions. I do not know how to proceed from here and am seeking advice. \n\nIf I could go back I wish I wouldnt have said anything about Jason but I was trying to be a good friend because I am very worried about her. \n\nThank you. \n\nAny advice is appreciated. \n\n",

It\u2019s more about where your friend is in her life than it is about you. Don\u2019t take it personally, but don\u2019t allow it to continue, either.\n\nI haven\u2019t known what to do when I was in a similar position a few times with an abused friend.

        "text": "Hi Redditors, I \\[29F\\] am finding myself in a bit of a pickle - a part of me wants to hold onto this friendship with this once \"close\" friend of mine (also 29F) in hopes that time will tell if the friendship improves, whereas another part of me wants to let go of nearly a decade's old friendship as it's soured and I can't see both of us making complete amends. Essentially, we met in university, and but didn't become close until the last two years of our degrees. We bonded over so many things - music, studies, dating scene, drama with family/friends - you name it. When I moved home, we still sent each other reels, memes and even upated each other pretty often; leaning on each other when work got tough or needed career/family/friend advice.  She was pretty much the only friend who came close to a \"best friend\" for me if you will. The comms lasted for about 3 years when I moved back home, before there was a noticeable decline in the frequency of our comms and a lag in updates. This was expected, given the distance, and just reality generally speaking. It wasn't until recently when things blew up, because of me (granted, it had to be done). A few years ago, her boyfriend (now fiance) had cheated on her. I won't go into the details, but essentially she forgave him as it was only \"emotional\" cheating, and she felt somewhat at fault for making the relationship go stale as she refused to compromise on things, and also felt she failed to bring excitement to his life. I was pretty livid to say the least, given how much hurt and pain she had expressed to me over calls and messages. Can't say I was too fond of her fiance from the get-go (something always felt off), and even though I gave her advice contrary to what she might've wanted to hear (e.g. you can do so much better!), I still respected her decision to want to stay with him. It seems however that he's held a grudge against me this whole time, given no matter how many times I've initiated dinner plans (whenever I visit) and always invite him, he never makes an effort to speak to me. They also bought a house last year, and never invited me over when I flew down for a visit for the week. Admittedly, I felt a but hurt by this given all our other friends had been invited for house-warming. Anyways, fast-forward to now, she's messaged me her wedding date, but I took it as an opportunity to have a major dig at her. At first, I was upset that they didn't really consider inviting my partner, but I think I was more upset at just how cold and distant she had become. I suppose the main issue for me was how she and her fiance have made me felt these last few years, and I didn't appreciate that. In her response, she said her fiance felt as though I alienated him from the rest of our friendship circle after the whole cheating thing, and didn't appreciate that I gave her advice encouraging her to leave and find someone better. Eventually, that led her to not telling me that they had bought a house together and not wanting to invite me over to their place to stay during my visit. It all came as a shock if I'm being honest, given I gave her advice and support as HER friend in confidence (private), and tried to be there for her to the best of my ability from a distance. To now know she used that advice and support against me cuts very deeply, and is makes me wander if this friendship is even worth pursuing going forward. Even though we had called and talked it out to make peace and vent, a part of me still doesn't feel right about attending the wedding (and I made that very clear to her). To be looked at as this malicious friend, when I had nothing but good intentions when giving advice and support to her is unbelievably hurtful. It also makes me see him in a different light now too, even though I gave him the benefit of the doubt believing he had moved on, but no, he had still harboured all these ill feelings towards me.\n\nTwo things:  \n1. Prior to things blowing up, she had sent me a birthday gift earlier this year. Exchanging gifts is something we've done every year, but do I get her a birthday gift this year but indicate this is the final exchange and that I've always appreciated our friendship and move on?\n\n2. Do I even bother going to her wedding? I think she's got it in her head that we're in the all clear, but her lack of comms and interaction with things I've put up on socials, etc is making me think it's better to sit this out even though she expressed to me over call she would still love for me to be there on her big day.",

                "body": "It all depends on whether or not you still care enough about her to maintain the friendship and acknowledge the difficulties that will continue to persist. If I\u2019m being honest, as long as that man is in her life, I don\u2019t think the friendship can improve. She clearly holds his opinion to a higher regard, so much so that it\u2019s clouding her judgement about you. While a part of her wants to be your friend, he might be filling her ears with negative things about you, influencing her to have this sort of \u201chot and cold\u201d behavior towards you. If I were in your shoes, I\u2019d probably keep my distance but keep things amicable. So, if you do decide to give her a gift and/or go to her wedding, that might indicate to her that things are okay when they might not be. At the same time, I don\u2019t know if there really is a good way to give her a gift but tell her it\u2019ll be the last time. Maybe you can get her the birthday gift and perhaps a wedding gift but don\u2019t attend the wedding. These are just my suggestions based on the vibe I\u2019m getting from you, but it\u2019s ultimately your decision.",

She has two children and is a young parent (23).\n\n Her oldest 5 year old kid curses like a sailor, spits on people, and says racial slurs. When she found out about his behavior towards me she told me \u201che\u2019s just a kid\u201d and to ignore it. Since then she has sort of faded away. She doesn\u2019t look at me, she doesn\u2019t make conversation with me, but with everyone else she lights up. \n\nI found her response invalidating and I never expected her to do that to me. When I\u2019m in the room she\u2019ll move to another. She\u2019s hot and cold, she\u2019ll cook for everyone, say good morning to me sometimes, smile at me. But on the other hand she\u2019ll leave the house without saying bye, won\u2019t say hi, etc.\n\nShe has said in the past that she is horribly awkward especially in person. But how awkward can she be if she has a husband, kids, and has a job where she works and takes care of people? So yeah, if anyone can help me see this from another perspective that would be nice as I feel blinded by emotions right now. ",

        "text": "I (F21) have been shy and antisocial since I started middle school. From elementary to highschool, it was mostly the same students, so the kids I used to be friends with drifted, most became popular. I never had a huge friend group anyway. I had 2 best friends, but had a huge falling out with both of them around 14. We are talking and are friends again, but it's never going to be the same. \n\nMy senior year of highschool, after only have a small friend group of about 4, one friend invited me to join their new group. Suddenly, I had a huge friend group. About 15 of us, a from freshman to senior. I had felt so loved for the first time in forever. I hosted 2 party's, a Halloween party and a new years party .\n\nUnknowingly to me and everyone else, I guess something happened at the first party between a couple in our friend group involving possible sexual harassment, I won't go into detail. Neither attended the second party, and we didn't know why until a week later. (For context, let's call them A and B. B said that A had touched them)\n\nWhen the news broke, I (18 at the time) tried to stay out of it. They were both freshmen (14) and it felt like a misunderstanding and none of my business. I expressed to the rest of the group that I wouldnt just completely cut A off, simply because I knew what it felt like to lose all my friends. I wasn't going to go out of my way to talk to them, but I also wasn't going to be mean a just ignore them if they said hello in class. \n\nThey group decided to talk behind my back about it, and came to the conclusion that I was \"supporting an abuser\". They didn't tell me either, they just didn't show up for lunch. They told me after I texted my BEST FRIEND SINCE 6TH GRADE asking where they were. \n\nI didn't try to explain myself. I just left. I lost everyone in an instant, for a complete misunderstanding that they didn't care enough to ask me about. Instead of thinking \"no, she wouldn't be like that, let's ask her\" like mature ppl, they just left. \n\nGot a text the next day from someone in the group with a huge paragraph as to why they didn't want to be my friend for a long time, and none of the things they said had anything to do with the situation.\n\n\nIt's been 3 years now, I still don't have real friends. I was 1 of 2 in my graduating class that didn't go to college. One person signed my yearbook, and that honestly saved my life. I texted him a few months after graduation thanking him, he and I were friends once in 8th grade. \n\n\nI don't go out, I dont meet new people, it's just me and my boyfriend. I'm really lonely.",

I genuinely enjoy our time together and feel good when we hang out.\nBut here\u2019s why I\u2019m posting: even though we don\u2019t live far from each other, we barely see each other. The last time we hung out was two weeks ago, and before that\u2026 it was six months earlier. Most of the time, I\u2019m the one reaching out \u2014 checking in on social media, trying to plan a day to go out, even choosing where we go.\nI\u2019m starting to wonder: is my friend actually being distant? Am I the only one really investing in this friendship? Or am I just trying too hard for something that\u2019s already fading?",

Maybe she has bad anxiety, maybe depression keeps her from reaching out or something like that. Perhaps it\u2019s not that. The only way you can actually find out what is going on is talking about it without accusing. Then what happens next is the best way to tell how invested the friend is. Do they make some small effort to make your needs felt met?",

I mean just don't regret your decision of doing something wrong.\nI know it's hard feelings when only genuine person in your life starts to ignore you. I've gone thru this moment in my life my friend started ignoring me never reaching out always dry and late replies even abusing me for messaging a lot. I knew something was changed there's a reason I confronted and got to know that he doesn't needs me anymore he got his love had other friends and a lot of side chicks. I tried to save the friendship but everytime I message him he replies with the abusive language that too in reference to my mom soo I just broke the friendship and in front of world I'm the culprit for breaking it with the reason that it's normal to use abuses among friends but I knew it was intentional and not in fun manner. Our friendship was just of 2-3 years but yours is 7 years and I don't know the whole situation also so I'll just suggest take your decision carefully and also prioritise your mental health and peace it'll hurt you a lot of you start being alone just because your friend doesn't always want you.",

        "post-author": "Real_life_fairy_",
        "text": "Ok guys, I need an external opinion about this because I am sure I am not being objective. I will try to be as brief as possible. \n\nThere are several things to take into account. First, I have good relationships with most people in my friend group. However, there is one girl (F26) that always tries to exclude me (F30) from every conversation, when I am talking or telling a story she always talks over me. When it\u2019s only the two of us with a third person she always talks to the third person (whoever it is) and totally ignores everything I say, she acts like I don\u2019t even exist. When it\u2019s only the two of us she is looking at her phone. She is super nice to everyone in the group except from me. When I share an opinion she always tries to confront me and prove I am wrong. I sometimes try to talk to her and be nice but it doesn\u2019t work. I just feel so bad when she is around and the fact that she is friends with everyone else except from me makes me feel even worse. \n\nSecondly, I have been dating one of the guys from my friend group (M27) for three months, then I ended things with him because we were not fully compatible. Basically, he was super nice to me and treated me so well in all aspects, but I didn\u2019t like his texting habits since he would always take a long time to respond, even days, and this is important to me. Even though I broke up with him, I told him I want to be friends, and he agreed and said our friendship is important for him, so we ended in good terms. And even though I don\u2019t show it, I am still SO into him. \n\nToday all of us from the friend group went to a party. At the beginning I thought I would have a lot of fun. However, the night went on and turned out to be awful. The girl that usually ignores me spent all the night acting like I don\u2019t exist, even more than usual!! And the guy I dated (and still like a lot) spent all the night talking to all my girl friends except from me. He literally talked to everyone in the group except from me and even kinda ignored me as well!!\n\nAt the end of the night everyone left except me, the guy I dated and the girl that usually ignores me, it was only the three of us left and we stayed for one hour more. During that hour, he spent all the time talking to this girl and ignoring me, and she also ignored me (as usual). Consequently, I felt so bad. \n\nJust to clarify: I am not jealous because they were talking, I know he doesn\u2019t like her and she is not his type. What bothered me is that I hate being ignored. When I was a kid I was an outsider and most girls in primary school would exclude me and bully me. As a consequence, being ignored really triggers me and makes me feel awful. \n\nAt the end, I had to leave the party and when I arrived home I started to cry. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand why they treat me that way. I know there may be many factors affecting this situation, but still it\u2019s difficult not to fall into the trap of believing that I am just unimportant to them and not worth a conversation for them.

Maybe she's jealous of you, maybe she has a thing for this guy that you were involved with, maybe she just doesn't like you for whatever reason, but regardless, she's acting like a middle school mean girl and you certainly don't need that. \n\nOverall this group of people seem immature. I was glad to read in one of your comments here that you're leaving your workplace and won't be seeing them as much anymore. Given that, I would try to not let her worry you too much. Try to limit your time while you're still seeing them every day, and afterward, you can choose to spend time with who you want from that group.",

But she started talking to this new guy and they really like each other and Im super happy for her. But everytime I talk/call to her and we talk about her new guy. She is always like omg Im scared hes gonna see your contact on my phone/messages so I had to unpin you. It doesn't really bother me all too much other than the fact that is kinda weird. Its more of the fact that I don't see a reason as to why she has to hide me. It makes me feel kinda bad that like if he sees me itll ruin their relationship or whatever, but I feel like she can also just tell him Im just a friend. \n\nTbh Im not really sure how to exactly feel, but it kinda creeps me out in a weird way. I mean our relationship hasnt really changed at all, we still facetime frequently and text etc. But something about it just feels weird and off. Kind of like she might be distant with me if they do get together, etc. But Im not really sure. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

        "text": "I have a problem and am willing to hear some hard truths (respectfully) about what I need to work on so that this is no longer a problem/something I feel self conscious about. I get nervous and cautious when meeting or befriending married/partnered women because I get weird vibes from their SO. And women are smart enough to pick up on those vibes and it creates awkwardness and discomfort with them too. I'm in a new town and really want female friendships.\n\nSome background about me: 34F currently single. I was sexually abused for years before becoming a teenager, was raised in a strict Christian home and then later had a period of promiscuity. I dont mean to slut shame others who enjoy casual sex, this is just the only language I know to describe a time in my life where I did not want to be living that way, likely because of internalized guilt from my upbringing. Also had a whole pick me era \ud83e\udee3, so cringe. Anyway, I'm aware of the effect I can have on men and there was a time that I found a lot of validation in that (maybe I still do?). But married/taken men were always off limits out of respect for their women. I've worked really hard to become someone I am proud of, and really have tried to gradually free myself of my past though not done yet.\n\nEver since I could remember, men would flirt, compliment me or do inappropriate things in front of their partners and I'd be SUPER uncomfortable and embarrassed. A prominent minister once reached across the couch to compliment/caress my legs in front of his horrified wife and I immediately left and never spoke to them again. My best friend from back home's husband once asked her why she can't be more like me (I've never interacted her husband without her or family around except for on the phone once while planning her birthday party). Both of these men put those women through a lot of toxic BS/cheating, but my point is that this has happened to me too many times (over 20 instances) for me to keep blaming the men. Its embarrassing and it happened enough times in my life that I'm really having to ask if I'm doing something to invite it. Do I subconsciously want these men to come on to me?\n\nI'm very self conscious about being in rooms with other men. If I know I'm meeting a woman with her partner, I will dress very modestly and sometimes refrain from wearing makeup. In the past, there was more of a stigma around single women around married couples but that is starting to improve. But there are single women who are able to have married/partnered friends and not have this issue. There has to be something more I can do, boundaries, more inner work, etc. \n\nIn a month I will be moving into a garden unit of the kindest senior couple I've ever met, for a year. During the tour I started to get a lot of attention and romantic eyes from the husband. I'm very concerned and I need advice on this. Thanks in advance!",

I feel like I might be coming across as needy or too eager because of how fast I respond to messages (I'm always on my phone) and how much I message (I yap a LOT). Especially since he has recently started dating, I'm not sure if he feels comfortable having a girl as his best friend which is completely valid. \n\nI've been having a lot of personal problems recently which I have been venting about to him as well so I'm pretry concerned that I've pissed him off with that sort of thing. After all it's bad enough for me to deal with let alone someone else having to stress for me too. I messaged him earlier to let him know that the issues are healing and that I think I'll be able to recover but I've been left on read. He usually responds pretty quickly when it's about my problems but I feel like he was only doing it to be polite or to get me to shut up (which thinking about now is a pretty valid thing to do). While a few months back we were messaging hours on end every day, now I feel that I might have just become the eager female friend who doesnt shut up about her problems. \n\nAm I overreacting or should I try toning down the amount/subjects of my texts from now on (especially now that he's dating)?",

        "text": "**This is a bit long, I tried to give every detail.** \n\nSo, for context, we have a friend group here in the dorms. Me, and my other 3 girlfriends. \n\nWe get along very well and have no problems. She does, however, has a way of saying it when she doesn't like something by giving examples of other people. For example, imagine yourself eating a lot of oranges lately and one day while you guys sit, she suddenly out of nowhere says *\"This guy I know literally eats oranges all the time and it's pissing me off.\"* \n\nSo very indirect and passive aggressive. \n\nProblem is, I'm struggling with heavy depression and ADHD. (Both diagnosed) **I KNOW** that it is no way an excuse, but I do sometimes delay my showers because I just can't stand looking at myself, feeling myself or be alone with myself. I always make sure to have fresh set of clothes, underwear, deodorant and perfume on me. I delay showers at a maximum of 5 days when I especially feel bad. Though they don't know this, as it is a personal matter. No one has ever said that I smell or look bad. But I cannot deny my hair *will* look greasy when I don't put on dry shampoo. \n\nSo, a couple days ago, we were sitting by the table, smoking and having conversations. Then a comfortable silence sets in, we kind of just scroll through our phones before she suddenly tells us; \n\n*\"I can't stand people with low hygiene, self-care or self-respect. It really turns my stomach, can't even stand to have my shoulder accidentally brushed against them.\"* \n\nMy other friend kind of stared and said *\"Okay, why are you telling us this right now...?*\" since it was very off topic. Then the comfortable silence turned into a very awkward and uncomfortable one. They stare at each other for a couple moments, my 3rd friend trying to understand who she is talking about, as the said friend just stares with a nervous smile. I didn't see if they made any facial gestures. I couldn't lift my head up from my phone because I felt too embarrassed to.\n\nShe ponders a bit and goes on to say, *\"I mean...\"*  and I reply with, *\"OK, sorry*,\" in a lighthearted way, both to ease the tension and hoping it wasn't directed towards me. She says, *\"Okay, don't take offense but...\"* then she laughs and talks about another guy at her class who apparently never washes his hair. I don't know if she tried to tell me something or was just joking. \n\nI don't want to overthink it, but if it was directed to me, I felt really humiliated since she decided to say that with a 3rd person next to us instead of coming to me in private. \n\nAs I said, I don't smell. I really do check it very frequently. I keep my body clean even if I did not take a shower when I needed to. I'm still working towards healing mentally and try my best every day. \n\n  \nWhat do you think about this? \n\nAm I just overthinking and making a false judgement? I really like my friend, I don't want to go and ask her personally if it was directed towards me, as it had already been a couple days. \n\nSorry for the messy explanation, its 5am lol ",

I was always the new girl in schools so I\u2019m really good at being social!

I thought it would get better as an adult because I\u2019m staying still in one spot and not just leavings the friends I make. But I swear I\u2019m PICKY AF. For instance, I\u2019ve had a friend since elementary that actually has kept in touch but not like besties or anything. She wanted to meet up and her idea of fun was us hiding from our partners and not telling them where I\u2019m going. Mmmm no thanks. Not my kind of person. If you can\u2019t be honest with your partner, how can you be a good friend. So broke it off because I just can\u2019t support someone being disrespectful or sneaky to their significant other. My best friend decided to start selling her body and I just can\u2019t get on the wagon to support that either because I know her potential is so much better and also she started bringing those same type of people around and I just CANT HANG. Everyone else wants to go to bars and drink and do drigs and party and it\u2019s like we are 30!!! I have kids but I\u2019m also young and want to have fun. But I just feel like I don\u2019t match anyone the right way and although I know I can\u2019t control others, the decisions they make as humans question the loyalty to friendship for me and them having no goals or aspirations does also. Anyone else feel like it\u2019s just the people in our generation that suck? Or do I suck for being too judgmental? lol.

You\u2019re always playing on the same side, and you need to communicate well to coordinate well. Let her know that she is important to you and so things that are important to her are important to you. That you love and support her platonically.\n\nDon\u2019t judge her unless she asks. Don\u2019t make assumptions about her without her telling you. If you wonder something, ask.

Without going into much detail this year I have dealt with some incredibly hard experiences of family violence. Obviously I told her everything and she always said she would do ANYTHING that I needed but because of her school stress I have been careful to give her space to not be burdened my issues. That said, I worry that I subconsciously depend on her too much even though it\u2019s not her role yet I can\u2019t help feeling resentment when I am experiencing it all alone.\n \nI asked her if she would attend a vigil with me and of course she said yes but as the day progressed  could see that she was concerned about her coming assessment so I told her not to bother coming and went alone. Since then she has apologised and shown immense remorse and I totally understand where she was coming from but I still feel so hurt and lonely. We have spoken about it on multiple occasions but any support she offers now just feels tokenistic and as if she\u2019ll only show up when it\u2019s convenient for her schoolwork. I know that it\u2019s too much pressure to expect her to be there all the time and I don\u2019t, however the fact that she won\u2019t support me when it doesn\u2019t suit her academically just hurts so much because I know I would drop everything to help her if the roles were reversed. I love her so much and I don\u2019t think space or time is the answer because I fear it will just perpetuate unwanted distance but I am so scared that I will push her away. I feel so helpless and don\u2019t know what to do. My heart is literally breaking.",

She was going through rough times and her and her family ended up staying with us temporarily, but it quickly became disastrous for various reasons and it kind of ruined our friendship. Had a big falling out. She said some toxic things and I shut her out completely. Ignored calls, texts messages. Left them on unread. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about her a lot recently and I finally opened up her messages she left me on insta and FB. I want to reach out because I\u2019m realizing life is short and another old friend passed away a year ago so it\u2019s really got me thinking about all our old times. and I truly miss her. I\u2019ve spent the last 3 years working on healing myself and I feel like I\u2019m in a good spot but idk if I should reach out to her or not!

Internally she was probably embarrassed that she and her family had to live with you and that may have slowly turned to anger, leading to the falling out. Even with best friends, sometimes less is more.\n\nMuch like family, you love them, but you don't always want to live with them.\n\nIf she eventually felt bad, it just took you longer to get to that point. It's different for everyone. If you do reach out, it's important not to point any fingers of blame, but suggest they were unique circumstances that could test even the best friendships, and that you too feel bad about it.\n\nReaching out to old friends can be scary, but if you can handle that the response might not be what you want or that you may not get one at all, then you eventually know you tried and can move on.",

        "text": "My best friend cheated on her fiance a few months before the wedding. Then she told me what she did, and told me not to tell another soul. His biggest fear is being cheated on. She's also kissed a few people and had some emotional affairs, but this last time she actually slept with the guy.\n\nShe's been pretty stressed about getting married, and I've been holding her hand through that process. The other day, I brought up a small issue and it turned into a fight. She blocked my number (which was shocking) then texted a mutual friend of ours that I was off my medication and that he should take space from me. This was so hurtful because she knew I would go to him for support, and tried to isolate me instead. \n\nAfter that, I freaked out. I was so hurt to be blindsided out of nowhere, and for her to use my mental illness against me (I have bipolar 2 but it is very stable and mild) to isolate me from my friends hurt so badly. I impulsively messaged her on another platform and told her to stop spreading rumors about me, and to confess the cheating to her fiance. Immediately I knew that was wrong, and that I was adding fuel to the fire. But it's already done.\n\nI'm realizing now that she has probably been feeling paranoid about me since she told me about the cheating. She's probably been living with the stress and guilt, especially because her fiance is uprooting his life and moving to another country to marry her. All the while totally blind to the fact that she cheated on him. \n\nAfter our little disagreement, she blew up on me. I think she has been worried this whole time that I would tell her secret if we got in a fight or something. So that must be why she tried to make me look mentally ill to discredit me, and isolate me from our friends so no one would listen to me. \n\nIronically, before she took these series of drastic measures, I never would have even considered outing her. I was ready to take that to my grave. I only told her to tell him because I felt so threatened by the rumors being spread about me.\n\nI think in some ways, she may resent me deep down. I am not getting married, not even in a relationship, I am just free to live my life and I love my career. Because of my life choices I have far less responsibility than she does. \n\nI am so shocked and so hurt by everything that has happened. It's a terrible way for a friendship to end. Some of her friends have begun unfollowing me on Instagram--I wouldn't be shocked if she's spreading even more rumors about me. It feels like suuuch a nightmare.",

        "text": "Recently, my wife and I went on a trip with another couple-friends. \n\nWe took our car. The drive was around 8h both ways 2 days apart as we stayed at our destination for a day. They offered to split gas among all of us equally, which was cool. \n\nI am usually against letting others drive my car because they are not on the insurance.\n\nMyself and the guy from another couple drove 2 hours each of day 1.\nI started the ride for 2 hours and then later he kept on telling me that he could drive as well. I felt that more of a request to drive my car than offering to be another driver. \nI broke my own rules of not letting others drive my car but given I trust his driving and I didn't want them to feel bad, I handed the keys. \nSo, he drove for the next 2 hours till we reached our hotel.\n\nThe next day, I was determined to drive. I slightly mentioned it on the previous day as well.\nWhile checking out for the hotel, I had to give the car keys to the other couple as I was still checking out with reception. Result: That guy started driving. I hinted that I would drive after the first stop. \n\nGiven it was quite a scenic ride, the other guy\u2019s wife started telling me that she would like to drive as well. It all felt that. \u201cHey, you can rest in the back and I can drive.\u201d\nI had to get the keys because I could not say no as they are good friends.\nAt this point, I was a little sad in the back sitting in my car yesterday and today, and not driving- I really like driving! \n\n2 hours passed by but there was no conversation about changing the driver now. We took a stop to have lunch but nothing changed, she continued driving. That is when I told clearly \u201cHey, let me drive in the next 30 minutes\u201d. I said that so that she would get some closure after almost 2h30m of drive. We stopped at the gas station and this is when I said (not asked) \u201cHey, I will drive now.\u201d I still got the vibe from that girl -\u201d Well, I can continue driving as well.\u201d\n\nI didn't read much and continued driving for the last 2h of the trip till we dropped them.\nMy wife didn't express much interest in driving because she doesn't like driving that much. \n\nI drove a kinda boring part of the trip(just straight dives on freeways) and no driving in the scenic town that we visited. \n\n1. Was I being an asshole in expecting that only my wife or I could/would drive our car as only we are on the car\u2019s insurance?\n2. I understand that if it was a rental car, all of us could feel entitled to drive. \n3. At the end, was it fair overall that I drove for 4h total and the other couple drove 2h30m each overall?\n\nWant to see what you would have thought to do in this situation? \nThanks for reading!\n\n\n",

        "text": "I am a senior in high school and have a group of 9 people, and I have a best friend, **Sasha**, and we used to be in a trio with another girl, **Reyna**. Our **trio** was amazing for 4 years, but one random day, Sasha left the group, and I used to always beg for her not to do this of to understand the situation, but this time there wasn't a reason. She just said, \"I want peace lemme have it ugh.. and by her words, I was so hurt that I just accepted it. I continued being friends with both Reyna and Sasha. Reyna was hurt more because Sasha left our trio for the 9 people group. We're not mad she chose them, but in the name of peace, she left our group. Now she's 24\\*7 on the 9 people group, let's call it **GROUP** with capslock. We were just disappointed that she chose that over us, that too because whenever she used to ask the group to hang out they will never execute it and we as a trio to keep her feelings we went out with her, we paid 8 out of 10 times. and mostly reyna did. and we have done soo many things for her. reyna used to live 30 minutes away from us and if sasha wanted to meet reyna would try and come to meet her and me too. this is what bothers me. this is just the tip of the iceberg of efforts. its just that after all of the things that me and reyna did, she still chose GROUP. and ill tell you, shes still 24\\*7 on the group and its mostly dead and everytime they talk they just talk about throwing random sarcasm about how they never hangout. like what? i and reyna have stopped to reply on that group and we dont interact much.\n\nnow fast forward to my birthday. few days ago it was my birthday and i got long messages from my other friends, longest message from reyna. sasha forgot to wish me until my story was up. and after she wished me, it was like weird. on the GROUP she was just going on about OMG WE WILL HANGOUT, SHE (I) WILL GIVE HER BIRTHDAY PARTY AND WE CAN MEET. OH MY GOD WHEN ARE YOU DOING THE PARTY.\n\ni played it cool i said later, now personally when i talked to sasha, i said \"i dont feel like celebrating.\"\n\nguess what she said next. she replied, \"are you insane. ok. dont cleebrate, ill just call the GROUP at my place, and ill invite you too, just pay the bill lol.\"\n\nafter this message i ignored her because who in the right mind says that.\n\ni am telling you roughly its been 4 years of the GROUP and 4 years of the trio. in the trio we've hungout more than 10-12 times EACH YEAR. and the GROUP has hung out hardly 8 times in four years and that too only on birthdays. reyna was someone who if sasha says she wants to hangout, reyna wont let her down, reyna will come by herself and buying us things. and during this this trio brekaing time, reyna's boyfriend cheated on her and she was in a sensitive place, i made sure to stick by her and help her, and she thanked me alot that  i stuck by her and helped her alot.\n\nback to the story.\n\nnow sasha also reached out to reyna that day and called her stupid, dumb, egoistic and what not just because reyna didnt want to hang out that day because she was gonna be with her family. but Sasha goes on about OH IS IT BECAUSE OF ME? I AM SORRY I TRIED TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS. IT WAS MY MISTAKE THAT I CHOSE TO SPEAK MY FEELINGS. this kind of things and honesstly reyna explained her a million times that she has no problem with the group, shes just busy on that day. but everytime sasha made it seem like it was her fault. and sasha does this everytime. she blames herself for eveything. this was very exhausting now.\n\niwill tell you what kind of a friend i was, i was the friend who will quite literally beg you to not break the friendship, i would say sorry a million times even though it wasnt my fault. i remember i apologized ALOT because she was hurt after i told her that her actions hurt me and she just said that \"you never understand me, you will never understand me. sorry i decided to show my real self.\"\n\nit was exhausting me and this time i was self aware it was 0% my fault i had done nothing but be nice and supportive chosing to stay with her because i had hopes. but this time i just accepted and didnt argue much, basically giving her the treatmest she used to give me earlier. and now she feels bad and honestly i am not going to beg again.  ill tell you one more thing, if she would ever hurt me, she NEVER SAID SORRY BY HERSELF. she just stayed quiet. she never texted me about the incident, i was the one who had to always bring up things because she never takes accountability. she doesnt know i have cried myself to sleep. and all i ever got from her, sasha texted me \"you dont even give a f.\" now that i am choosing a different way of handling things, she thinks i dont care. she never saw it when i used to care. never.\n\ni chose myself this time, this is senior year i dont want to mess my surroundings more than they are. i am not gonna seem the weak friend always apologising always begging. i am done.\n\nplease give me advice. was i wrong, was i right?",

Rocky stuff happened between them what I know as being poor communication and what not. So they broke up, it was VERY mutual and we even hang out for hours after the break up. After that they Didn\u2019t talk I didn\u2019t force any peace treaty bc thats their choice. B was very close to me though this whole thing helping each other with struggles and they even helped me and my boyfriend start dating. Cool . They broke up August 2024 id say and A would make direct reposts about B being shitty and even prank calling them w no caller ID. I started to distance myself from A not only because of the immature behaviour but also since I\u2019d text them multiple times a day with no replies fot weeks and barely ever hanging out with them. I stopped texting them in April cos I assumed they wanted space. I never blocked them on anything and would like their posts etc\u2026 they were free to text me whenever they felt. They now posted a video with a direct hit to me saying \u201cpicking your best friends ex over your best friend\u201d that was NEVER my intention ever.

At first I saw it as that friendship where you could vanish and be busy and come back like nothing happened! It was fun! Really fun. \n\nRecently however I\u2019m having doubts. This is the real issue. I have a strong feeling she only speaks to me whenever she either Has no one left to talk to or friends in general she\u2019s had issues with. \n\nNow what I mean is she does live quite a distance but I\u2019ve seen she hangs out with her partner a lot and another friend of theirs. She was with a group of people of the same hobby and only spoke to me properly to vent about once that group disbanded. We gamed, we talked, it was fun. But what set me off recently was she had a best friend before me who got with her boyfriend at the time and cheated. Few years later they\u2019re fine suddenly and hanging out in a nice catch up??? I just don\u2019t get it. If I had a best friend who got with my partner I\u2019d be devastated and cut them off forever. I have confronted her about something where I did feel forgotten and she did straight up say she forgot about me. Which hurt. But oh well. \n\nBut I just feel so fucking alone. I just wish I had a friend who didn\u2019t come to me for favours and favours only and had similar interests. I go to the cinema alone and get called bloody brave but it\u2019s only because my friends cancel last minute. Every. Single. Time. It\u2019s always their way or the highway and every time I vent they avoid me. But it\u2019s okay for THEM to vent. I just don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going wrong. Maybe I\u2019m the problem? For never setting boundaries because I\u2019m only just learning to grow a backbone. I always worry I\u2019m little miss victim complex too. \n\nIt sucks. I\u2019m typing this out of pure tiredness but just any reassurance or advice please. Thank you! \n",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I have some common acquaintances we met via our closer friends. I get frustrated whenever they are hanging out with us, because they don\u2019t ask any questions about us, yet they talk a lot about themselves whenever we ask stuff. My boyfriend and I are both good at questions, we don\u2019t like awkward silences so we\u2019re almost always the ones starting conversations. My boyfriend sees no problem with this, but to me it turns into a chore and makes me not want to hang around these people. We\u2019ve had several arguments over this, because some of these distant friends even invite us to their birthday parties, and I don\u2019t want to go, since they couldn\u2019t even name 5 things regarding myself based on how little interest they\u2019ve shown in actually getting to know us. I feel like if I\u2019m giving my time and making the effort of going out with people I should not feel like I\u2019m interviewing them every time. The other option is to just not meet them, but my boyfriend would still go out with them and I\u2019m just left by myself, which I don\u2019t want. Have you ever been in a situation like this? Is there a way I can stop being bothered about this? Are my standards too high? ",

I tried apps but all those people look like very social extroverts and I don\u2019t think they would like me.

If you exist in a space and visibly do something interesting, sometimes people will come to you instead of you having to approach them.\n \nIf you can bring yourself to approach someone, a compliment followed by a question about that compliment can be good. Like \"I love your necklace where did you get it?\" or \"I love your shirt what season of [show the shirt references] are you on?\".\n \nI'll be honest though, I don't know what steps come after that. With some study and practice it is not too difficult to get people to like you, but it is difficult to know how much of yourself to reveal how quickly \ud83d\ude05",

        "post-author": "Informal-Syllabub-95",
        "text": "So my friend sent me a break up text because I hadn\u2019t been reaching out. That it had been 7 weeks and she was just sitting watching that go up waiting for me to reach out first. \n\nI hadn\u2019t really known there was an issue until the break up text. I was a little upset this week because my two friends were together and I wasn\u2019t invited. \n\nI have been dealing with health issues for 3 months that i did not want to share with anyone. So I had stepped back because I needed to. \n\nThere was one night she sent me a message about going to the arcade and I remember that day. I didn\u2019t answer for 17 hours but I never saw the message. I had a bad day with my health I think I scrolled on fb and shared something and was on instagram cuz she said I know you were active that she saw me online. I never opened Snapchat that night and I was so tired for context I think I have POTS so I was so tired, I don\u2019t even remember plugging my phone in and going to bed. But I do know I went to bed really early that night. \n\nThis may have been a mistake on my part as I saw it in the morning but I didn\u2019t reply to that I answered her other message. I thought since I had already missed the plans I didn\u2019t need to comment on it. Instead I replied to the other message about going to a trade show. With how my body reacts I knew if I went with them I\u2019d only be there 5 minutes. So I told them the truth I was going with my mom. I still said hi to them. I didn\u2019t tell them I was scared I\u2019d get sick or suddenly feel so exhausted that I would need to leave. After that I got no more messages from them. \n\nThese friends have been making me feel unseen for months. If I sat in the backseat of the car they would make no attempt to include me in conversation would talk so low I couldn\u2019t hear them. \n\nSo when I got her message. It blamed me for everything, said I needed to figure out how to communicate and deal with my feelings. So I replied and I feel like I did own up to my part. I\u2019ve told her several times communication is hard for me and try but we had already had this conversation before and nothing changed. The conversation before didn\u2019t touch on everything I had been feeling for an entire year. How I noticed they way she treated me was different then her other friends. \n\nI feel like in my message I touched on the things she said I did wrong. That she was hurt I never ordered from her new home business. But I live with my mom and she only gets paid once a month and it\u2019s gone in a week and everything else fell onto me. So I was counting every dollar and financially I couldn\u2019t order. Not if we wanted to eat. \n\nShe said I never shared her posts. But when she first started her business I wasn\u2019t using the Facebook app. And when I did I never saw her posts if I had I would have shared them. But I told her in my reply I was alway on her side and was wishing her success when she talked about people ordering from her I was so happy for her. But that I guess doesn\u2019t count as support. I felt guilty and if she had asked me and communicated this to me I would have explained to her all this and I would have tried to do better to go to her page more often. I didn\u2019t tell her I had shown my other friends he page and my coworkers. But I can\u2019t force them to order or follow. If I had told her she wouldn\u2019t have believed me. \n\nI feel like in my message I took accountability and then told her how she had been making me feel for months. That I hadn\u2019t been reaching out but I was dealing with so much on my end, that my entire life had changed because of my health that I was just trying to survive. I wish I had reached out more during that and it\u2019s a regret I have. \n\nI saw she reposted something that said I hate people who don\u2019t take accountability, run from their problems and from a situation of their own making. I felt she didn\u2019t take any accountability for how she made me feel that she had hurt me to. I apologized for my hurt. I know I\u2019ll never get one from her tho. That she put the entire blame on me. And honestly was pretty rude. I got a little mad at the part about how maybe one day she\u2019ll be the one to reconsider our friendship. Like I don\u2019t have a choice in it. I no longer have her message but I will attach the long one I sent her. \n\nI know I wasn\u2019t a perfect friend, but I don\u2019t think I was a completely unsupportive and bad friend like she\u2019s making me out to be. I didn\u2019t lie in my message back to her and I know she thinks i did, I know she thinks I didn\u2019t take account ability but I needed to explain each instance. I don\u2019t feel like I was making excuses. But maybe I was. I deleted our text thread because I couldn\u2019t keep rereading the message anymore. But I typed mine in notes trying to cover everything she said I did to her while telling her my feelings. \n\n\nMy message back to her: \n\nHey,\nThanks for your message. I\u2019ve been sitting with everything you said, and I want to share where I\u2019ve been coming from too, because a lot of it has been weighing on me.\n\nI didn\u2019t stop reaching out because I didn\u2019t care I honestly started to feel like a third wheel, like I wasn\u2019t really wanted around anymore. Every time I messaged, it felt like the responses were short or distant, and it got hard to keep putting myself out there when it felt so one-sided. So I waited too  I guess both of us were hoping the other would reach out first.\n\nEvery time the three of us went out as a group, if I ended up in the backseat, you guys made no effort to include me in conversation. I wasn\u2019t able to participate, and no one looked back or noticed that I hadn\u2019t said a word. It was like I wasn\u2019t even there.\n\nAbout the arcade I genuinely didn\u2019t see your message until the next morning. Yes, I was on Facebook posting things, but I went to sleep around 8 or 9 and didn\u2019t check Snapchat for messages. When I did the next morning, I saw your message, but by then I felt like I had already missed the moment, so I didn\u2019t think adding to it would really make sense. It wasn\u2019t that I was ignoring you.\n\nAs for your baking I want you to know I\u2019ve been cheering you on quietly, even if it didn\u2019t show. I haven\u2019t shared your posts because I genuinely haven\u2019t seen them on my feed. And I haven\u2019t been able to order anything either not because I didn\u2019t want to support you, but because I\u2019ve been trying to climb out of a financial hole. With my mom being paid less and only once a month now, everything\u2019s been falling on me, and I\u2019ve had to make some really tight choices. Still, I\u2019ve truly hoped things have been going well for you, and I honestly wish you nothing but success. I was always planning to order once I wasn\u2019t counting every dollar.\n\nI know I haven\u2019t been great with communication. That\u2019s something that\u2019s always been hard for me not as an excuse to not try, but just something I\u2019ve been actively working on. I\u2019ve always chosen distance when I feel unwanted, even when that\u2019s not the healthiest way to deal with things. I think it comes from past experiences where I wasn\u2019t listened to. Every time I wanted to reach out, I kept going back to this moment in high school where my best friend invited me to hang out. I got ready and waited to be picked up, only to get a message saying the plans were canceled and later found out someone else told her I shouldn\u2019t come, so she uninvited me. I guess I felt like that was happening again.\n\nSo I\u2019m sorry that the way I deal with things affected you and caused hurt. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been a bad friend, and I understand if you don\u2019t want to be friends anymore. I did think about reaching out and saying something, but it was hard to get past the hurt I was feeling too. You\u2019re not the only one who felt hurt. I noticed how you\u2019d message Skyler like in Calgary, when you saw some girl wearing Cars Crocs and sent her a message because you knew she\u2019d like it. You never did that with me. Never sent me a photo or a message just because you saw something you thought I\u2019d love. Yeah, I noticed. You treated me differently.\n\nThere\u2019s also something that\u2019s lingered with me that I haven\u2019t really talked about last summer when my cat went missing. I was crying my eyes out and felt completely wrecked. That honestly felt like one of the worst times in my life, and it really hurt that you didn\u2019t offer to come help me look or even check in. I felt so alone in that. And while I was in that kind of pain, you guys went to a movie and didn\u2019t even invite me. I know people grieve differently, but that moment stuck with me. It made me feel like I wasn\u2019t someone who mattered when I was going through something deeply painful.\n\nI didn\u2019t go to the market with you guys because I didn\u2019t feel like I could handle being in that dynamic again. I\u2019ve honestly felt replaced and like I don\u2019t matter as much anymore when we\u2019re all together. I\u2019ve felt completely invisible. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to stay long anyway My health\u2019s been a mess the last couple months, and I haven\u2019t had the energy emotionally or physically to reach out. And I didn\u2019t really feel like I could open up about that with you anymore.\n\nWhen you had your toe done, I wanted to make you a care package. But when I thought about it, all I could think was, \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t do this for me if the roles were reversed.\u201d When you were going through issues with your gallbladder, I thought every day for weeks about checking in to see how you were doing and then I didn\u2019t. Because I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d do the same if it were me. And when I told you at spin class about the dizzy spells that came out of nowhere, it felt like you didn\u2019t even care.\n\nThen I saw you got Skyler flowers, and it made me remember all the times I picked up little things for you, just because I thought you\u2019d like them, especially at the beginning of our friendship. And I guess part of me realized that it wasn\u2019t really mutual, and that hurt too. So I stopped. I started putting some distance between us not to punish you, but to protect myself. Because I didn\u2019t know how to bring it up, and I felt like if I did, the friendship would end because I\u2019d be \u201ctoo much\u201d or \u201ctoo dramatic.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not trying to put all the blame on you, and I don\u2019t think you should put it all on me either. I\u2019m sad that it got to this point, but I hope at least you can understand that this wasn\u2019t just me not caring.\n",

        "text": "I need advice on my situation please\n\nI\u2019m currently stuck in a dilemma of where I feel depressed over never getting a conclusion to a friendship.\n\nSo I met this girl around middle school and we really stuck, I think we both shared a really good chemistry with each other that made us like each other a lot, we enjoyed each other presences. Through our relationship though, I observed overtime that we always just lacked the right time, moments or something would happen between us that would stop contact with us for a while. It was like a on and off friendship where I don\u2019t think we ever had chance to truly connect. This happened about 2 times before current day. One of them was my fault in all honesty and the other was her\u2019s, we both were able to acknowledge it when we brought it when connecting again this time around.\n\nFast forward to like these past few months were she hit me up on Instagram to talk again and also to check up on me. I think in recent years my depression has been at a all time and it\u2019s get to a point where sometimes it\u2019s really obvious to people I\u2019m going through something, I think that\u2019s what she might of observed which partially prompted her to hit me up. We talked a lot for that week and were able to get a lot of our thoughts about each other and issues we had by talking and honestly it felt really good at the time. We started talking again in person and meeting up then, I wish it honestly lasted like that but I really fucked up bad.\n\nDuring that one week we talked non stop, she confessed to me that she still had feelings for me but she didn\u2019t want to pursue anything, I admittedly said I had the same exact thing but honestly I suck at love. I don\u2019t know why but I think it was because it was our desperation and also because she was like one of the first people in my life I really felt attached to, I started kinda throwing subtle hints at a relationship even thought she said she wasn\u2019t ready. This kinda prompted her for a week to just not talk to me which I quickly picked up on and stopped.\n\nWe talked that weekend and we kinda ended up having a 1 to 1 conversation about our friendship but I feel like I didn\u2019t conclude the best way or do it right way. I honestly kept bringing up my depression and my past relationships like some type of excuse towards why I was always in this bad mood or was just doing those actions. While I believe that past trauma and experiences really shaped why I react certain ways under pressure, it wasn\u2019t an excuse for my actions.\n\nI honestly told her that I was just depressed, I didn\u2019t know what to do nor how to go get help because she suggested I get therapy but I\u2019m honestly scared of people being in my business, I\u2019m fine with a therapy but I\u2019m still a minor under law and I don\u2019t want my parents or anyone around my social life to really know about mental problems even though it would prob be beneficial. Overall I told her that maybe it was best if we just stayed like long distance. While I don\u2019t know anymore if that was best option, I really fuckin regret saying it.\n\nI still really miss her, like she was a great friend to me. I would have been fine wherever that thing landed at but I was stupid enough to ruin that bridge we connected again this time around. I feel like the constant disconnect from her made me feel more depressed and desperate for her back. The way the chat ended felt so inconclusive that I don\u2019t know how she even feels about what I said or what she even think about me. I was thinking of writing a letter to her one last time, really to just conclude all my thoughts towards us. I honestly kinda plan on it being my last message to her because she moving away next year and even though it was maybe simpler or easier for me to stay friends with her. A part of me feels that I really need to let her go because at this time, maybe it\u2019s not best for her to be friends with me when I feel mentally unstable. I really fuckin care for her but I just don\u2019t know anymore. I genuinely feel like crying everyday over it. It\u2019s been like weeks and I\u2019m still not over it.",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nSo my bestie and I have known each other for 10 years, met in high school got closer after she broke up with her bf. She has been single ever since. We are both insecure and lonely people, she has been diagnosed with ADD and Anxiety, I have with depression. So yeah, we are emotionally both very unstable and tend to overthink and over analyze a lot. Here comes the issue that's been annoying me lately, she had a crush for a guy for 3 years, she met the guy at uni and they went on one date, nothing ever happened afterwards and she was devastated. At first of course I was understanding because it happened to me several times as well. I had a fear of rejection so I totally understand feeling blue after a guy you like doesn't seem to want more than stay friends or be an acquaintance. But the thing is, she doesn't seem to move on from these kind of situations. She cried  for 3 years about the same guy and only recently stopped crying about him. She met a guy she hooked up with during a vaycay and apparently instantly fell for him. Since the guy just got out of his relationship (allegedly gf cheated) he of course isn't really keen on starting something when he hasn't even processed his relationship yet. \nNow, she is crying about him. She is 26 and says that she'll never find somebody. I don't know what to say anymore because that's exactly how it started with the other guy. I have driven to her place multiple times, invited her to mine, have looked for therapists for her, talked to her mom. I just don't know what to do anymore. Her mom doesn't know what to do anymore either. She won't let this guy go either, I know it. She will say that she will never find someone, which is not true. She gets attention from guys but always seems to pick guys that are emotionally unavailable and I have told her that she needs to go therapy, which she refuses. She says it doesn't work. She has been to therapy three times, the first two people were assholes and the third was actually decent but it seemed she never really tried the things that her therapist told her. One big revelation I had with therapy is that you actually have to do the work. She believes in manifesting and the universe and wants to manifest a guy and more stable mental health but I dunno anymore. \n\nWe are currently on a trip together (was planned as a solo trip by me, but I invited her and regret it) and she cried for some time and stopped speaking to me temporarily, now is speaking again. I totally understand fear of rejection and how it sucks, I'm insecure myself and have had to deal with it but I dunno what to tell her anymore. It seems like she is restarting a cycle every time she meets someone. She gets attention from guys that are interested and by her own accounts are gentlemen but she falls for the guys that barely look at her or just use her. \n\nI'm a bit triggered currently because I wanted this trip to go well, have family issues and of course my mental health that's a disaster and I thought inviting her was a good idea but I'm soooooo regretting ever mentioning this trip to her. \n\nAt this point I want to distance myself because she refuses to take meds or try another form of therapy. I can't seem to help her and feel a bit overwhelmed and burdened. I have had issues with my mental health for a long time but I decided that I needed help and I am working on myself. I want her to do the same but she refuses. ",

So what this is basically you cannot interfere with someone who doesn't want to be helped they have to want it to change and you constantly trying to help her won't do her any good but keep her on this terrible path. I know it sounds terrible to watch her fail and suffer but the only way she will ever heal and change is if she fails and suffers\u00a0 only through her decision not you, not therapy and not her family can help her. She needs to find her own journey to change and if she is ever ready in her mind to ever change that's on her not your responsibility.\u00a0\n\n\nI know you love her and you have known her for years but now it's at the point of back to what the theory suggest so the LET ME part is you have to focus on your mental health and fix whatever you have going on in your life and protect your peace. So yes you will have to distance yourself or tell her straight up you need to focus on your mental health or move on completely entirely up to you.",

        "text": "As the title says, I\u2019m suffering from extreme loneliness right now. I moved out of my hometown (and home country) 3 years ago to study abroad, my social life during that time was wonderful: I had loads of friends and partied all the time, I had people to hang out with at all times and never suffered from loneliness, I also met my boyfriend who I\u2019m still with and love very much, but we\u2019re currently long distance as we\u2019re from two different countries. I came back to my hometown for summer break (3 months) and I think I\u2019m genuinely falling into a depressive episode. After I moved out 3 years ago I lost almost all of my friendships because of the distance, I only have 2 people that I\u2019m in constant touch with, besides that it\u2019s just randoms from my old school that I\u2019ll meet up for coffee from time to time, but it\u2019s not very enjoyable as it\u2019s forced and awkward. I don\u2019t have anyone to actually spend time with on a daily basis. I\u2019m alone all the time because I simply don\u2019t have anyone to even invite to do something. This drastic change from being a complete extrovert with a lot of social interactions to a loner with nobody to spend time with is driving me crazy. Do you have any advice on how to either meet new people or deal with this? How do I accept the fact that I\u2019m lonely? I can\u2019t get over it and I just cry all the time thinking about what my life has become. I know this is insanely pathetic, but idk what to do anymore lol Also if it matters at all I\u2019m an 18 (soon 19) yo girl",

And I\u2019m..only with Naomi. But they\u2019re my only friends. Lately, she started acting closer and closer with them than me. This sounds really selfish, but it hurts so much watching Naomi, who I was sure would partner with me, choose Melissa without a second thought. (I was going to be partners with Naomi, but seeing how melissa is alone forgets that I will be a lone \u2026) And Kellie and sandy pairs up. No one cares about me, alone. Funny thing is that Sandy was the one who perked up, saying how I was alone. What twisted the knife was Naomi brushing it off. Naomi had been choosing Melissa all day today. While I was alone. the four of them was just..closer. Even if I had been friends with Naomi first. They knew eachothers houses and often went. They texted each other for hours. They hang out after school. I was never asked to join. I only even joined the gc because when me and Naomi was still inseparable, she added me. I know Naomi is nice and probably doesn\u2019t notice. But I can\u2019t take this anymore. But also, Naomi was my only friend.. What should I do?",

One of them stopped talking to me completely in 2024 (which I am so grateful for because she truly was a toxic person) and I\u2019m not as close as I used to be with the other one (even though we still talk sometimes).\n\nI can honestly say that I am much happier without those girls around me. I ended up reconnecting with other friends and I am now able to express my emotions around my new friends and be open with them instead of putting walls up out of fear from being gossiped about and lied to. \n\nMy old friends were not safe people for me to be myself around or come to when I needed a safe space even though I was always there for them in that manner. One of them even said 2 things to me that really messed with my head for a while. We work together and one day she looked at me and said \u201cI don\u2019t know why the people here like you so much. You\u2019re actually not a nice person.\u201d And then there was another time when I was telling her a story about a time I was hurt and I mentioned that I cried and she looked at me and said \u201coh wow you actually do that? You\u2019re just an emotionless robot.\u201d So yeah you can see why I\u2019m happy that friendship is dead and gone. \n\nIt most definitely was hard for me to open up to my current friends but they really are good people and have made me feel safe in ways that my old friends could never do even if they tried. Letting go does hurt but it is honestly and truly so worth it. In my experience, good friendships don\u2019t end over silly little things. If a friendship (even one 5+ years long) ended over things like gossiping and lying then be glad it\u2019s over ! Sooner or later it would\u2019ve drained the life out of you.",

My best advice I can give, is know in your heart you want them to be the best version of themselves and then remove them from all social medias, you will want to stalk and know what they are doing (which is normal) but in the long run it will hurt you more and more. In conclusion, you will hurt but you are hurting yourself way more mentally and physically. Best thing to do is to pray and let go.",

Yet soon after I would see on social media of J hanging out with them, and he became close with them.\n\nI've had the (uncomfortable) chat numerous times with J that seeing him be close with these people feels like major disrespect, and he always brushes it off by saying \"get over the past\" or \"i'm not friends with them to piss you off\" and also says I\u2019m being too picky. But him staying friends with them is not only a painful reminder of that time , it\u2019s also an active reminder that I don\u2019t have a loyal friend with basic decency.\n\nI know I can\u2019t control others, and humans are inherently selfish by nature, no one truly cares about you unless it benefits them. The other side is also that J is his own person, and I should focus on the friendship between us rather than caring who he\u2019s friends with. Still, the fact remains that he knew the full context and chose to be close with those people anyway, which makes it hard to ignore.\n\nI expect loyalty from a close friend, especially one I\u2019ve known practically my whole life. The issue is I really have no other friends and I\u2019m scared of being alone, so I feel like I cling to this connection cause of familiarity, even though it causes me mental anguish. I don\u2019t know if I should stay friends with J out of loyalty and history , or if it\u2019s time to let go.\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate some outside perspective and advice, thanks.",

Becoming friends with someone\u2019s ex isn\u2019t generally the best \u2018in\u2019. \n\nIs your ex in a powerful position?",

Later, I found out that they had been relaying what I said back to my ex and her circle. So despite claiming to be neutral, they were clearly trying to gain favour with her, because indeed she and her circle had powerful social pull (my rep literally got ruined from the rumours spread by them).\n\nOne of them literally admitted this, wrote me a long apology about playing both sides and trying to get close to my ex. I tried to forgive them. But not long after that, they fully became friends with her (behind my back too), and that\u2019s when I cut them off completely.\n\nIn my opinion that is scumminess of the highest order. If that isn't objective disrespect then I don't know what is.\n\nHowever I couldn't care less about those people, they are just irrelevant remnants. The real pain comes from J, my lifelong friend, who knew all this and still chose to get close with them. That\u2019s what continues to hurt the most.",

Yesterday we went for a walk in the park with my dog . ( We actually met because of my dog at the park ) . Mind you I don\u2019t have many friends especially female friends . I haven\u2019t had a strong friendship with a female for quite some time so I\u2019m not even sure how to handle one anymore . Anyways so we were at the park and my dog started acting so weird ( overly dramatic & hyper) ( she has never acted like this on a walk) . We were high too cause we had been smoking . Idk why I said this but I said to her \u201cplease don\u2019t get my dog too excited \u201c( because she loves dogs and dogs love her it\u2019s in her nature ) and maybe I thought my dog was just being overly excited because of her presence. And then I also said \u201cmaybe that\u2019s what your boss was talking about \u201cShe had previously told me that she was upset because her boss  at work had told her that she was \u201ctorturing the dog\u201d . She\u2019s a nanny and takes care of a child but at the same time they have a dog . And at work she plays with the dog and kid and recently her boss had told her she\u2019s torturing the dog because she had the kid in top of the crate. Anyways she was super upset about that and shared that with me . When I told her my comment at the park she got super offended and defensive. She started saying how she trusted me to share her frustration with me over her issues at work for me to basically bring it up again in a negative matter and use it against her . I never meant to intentionally bring it up in a rude way I was just aggravated at the moment with how my dog was acting . Anyways right there in there I told her sorry I didn\u2019t mean to be rude or anything and that I apologize for anything I may have said that made her feel uncomfortable. However she then kept saying that I\u2019m just \u201cjealous \u201c . She says I was jealous that my dog was so excited and hyper to have her around because it\u2019s in her nature that dogs and kids love her. On top of that she brings up that I seem to be a negative and unhappy person . Saying that I am sad with my life and miserable and that I feel like a failure and that\u2019s why I project my anger outwards to other people . Mind you she speaks very loudly so half the park must have heard everything she told me . Even if what she said was true I don\u2019t think it was right for her to say all those things to me and on top of that try to publicly humiliate me   . ",

Her reaction was over the top and way out of line. Accusing you of jealousy, insulting your character, and doing it loudly in public? That\u2019s not how a real friend handles conflict. Honestly, her response says more about her than it does about you.",

It\u2019s a hard and lonely place to be, especially when it feels like people you care about don\u2019t see or include you like they used to.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about looks or age. People grow, shift, and sometimes drift \u2014 and it\u2019s not always your fault. That feeling of \u201cbeing forgotten\u201d isn\u2019t a reflection of your worth, but often a mirror of where they are in life \u2014 distracted, busy, or simply not as intentional as they should be.\n\nStill, I know that doesn\u2019t make it hurt less.\n\nSometimes, the people around us don\u2019t realize the weight of our silence. We stop reaching out to see who\u2019ll notice... and no one does. That can be crushing. But please don\u2019t confuse being unnoticed with being unlovable. You are not doing life wrong. You're just becoming more aware \u2014 and that awareness can be painful but also freeing.\n\nIt might be time to invest in connections that feel mutual, warm, and reciprocal \u2014 even if that means building new ones from scratch. And if you\u2019re grieving the friendships that once felt closer? That\u2019s okay too.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to outgrow people. You\u2019re allowed to want more. And you deserve to be chosen, celebrated, and seen without begging for space.\n\nYou're not alone, even when it feels like it. Sending you a hug and a reminder: you're enough, just as you are",

My therapist thinks I should just tell her I don\u2019t want to hear about that part of her life but I think that\u2019s rude and I should just stop calling and texting her. I believe she also evaluates her friendship on how often she talks to people lol What do you guys think ?

It\u2019s wild how many of us (me included) have operated on the \u201ctalk = friend\u201d formula \u2014 like emotional Sims, for real. But what you\u2019re realizing is so real: proximity doesn\u2019t always equal connection.\n\nJust because someone talks to you a lot or shares space doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re your person. And it\u2019s okay to outgrow that type of dynamic.\n\nYour therapist sounds wise \u2014 not everyone we vibe with temporarily has to be upgraded to \u201cfriend.\u201d Sometimes, they\u2019re just associates, gym buddies, or season characters in our lives. And the more you grow in self-awareness, the more you realize not all energy is for you \u2014 and that\u2019s not rude, it\u2019s discernment.\n\nAs for her drama \u2014 you\u2019re not wrong to feel drained. It\u2019s one thing to support a friend in crisis, it\u2019s another to be a dumping ground for avoidable chaos. And yes, you can set a boundary without being harsh. Something like:\n\u201cHey, I\u2019ve been needing to protect my mental space lately, so I\u2019m not in the best place to process heavy stuff. I hope you understand.\u201d\nThat way, you\u2019re not ghosting or pretending \u2014 but you\u2019re also not absorbing energy you don\u2019t consent to.\n\nBottom line: you don\u2019t owe anyone permanent friendship just because they gave you consistent conversation. And the more you practice boundaries, the more aligned your relationships will feel.\n\nYou're not a bad person for feeling this way \u2014 you're just finally differentiating between comfort and connection.

Most of the group was introduced through me, and 2 of the people are girls I became best friends/roommates with in college. My friend from growing up has had issues with feeling jealous of my other friends and it has caused some issues in the friend group dynamic in the past. Personally she has gone through a lot of friendship difficulties when we were younger and she\u2019s verbalized to me that she is nervous she\u2019ll lose me as a friend. I totally understand her perspective and have told her to be clear with what she needs to feel validated and okay in our friendship. \n\nI am very in tune to peoples emotions and can read her very easily since we\u2019ve known each other for so long, and we\u2019re basically family. With that being said, I can tell that she still resents my other friends and puts her guard up with them. It has caused problems in the past of my college friends feeling as though they\u2019re left out. I constantly am put in the middle of them and feel like it lies on me to make every one happy. I\u2019ve even said I regret making them all be friends because it has just put me in a bad place of feeling like the middle man. We do a lot as a big group but there are times where it\u2019s just my roommate and me and some of our other common friends, which leads to my two college friends feel left out. A lot of the time, my roommate makes the plans and doesn\u2019t always text them and only includes two other friends in our group who she\u2019s personally closer to. I don\u2019t know how to keep this big group dynamic up because it feels like someone is constantly feeling left out/lesser than. I also think it would just be crazy to fully make us all stop hanging out because the group is so interwoven. It is odd because my roommate is accepting of other friends I\u2019ve introduced to her and she\u2019s become close with them, but my two college friends she holds some grudge. Being an empathetic person is hard, because I see all of their sides and just want everyone to get a long. I just need some advice if there\u2019s ways to moderate it or if I really just need to let go of this all and not care since it doesn\u2019t directly involve me",

        "post-author": "Express_Lunch_1947",
        "text": "today I am in utter disbelief and pain that my BEST friends of two ish years have dropped me. one girl in this friend group dropped me three times. my question is, is it just this friend group? a lot of my decent close friends have been telling me to stop going back to the girl, because she is toxic. however I never listened to them and kept on going back and was constantly getting dropped. the first time was a few months after I met that girl, but we became friends again after a day or two. The next time was one of the hardest, where she told me I changed and was a b word then turned my entire friend group against me, but after a week she came back apologizing telling me how she was a b word and shouldn't have said all these mean things, and we eventually became friends again. after a few months of happiness she dropped me again due to complications with her mom and me. (Her mom hates me) it took a month to become friends again when she texted me on Roblox silly goofy stuff then slowly started talking again. Up till today. She sent me this message talking about how I'm disgusting and how even though I'm sweet, they don't want to be friends with me anymore. What really confused me is that I said hi to one of the girls involved literally the morning of, and hanged out with like all of them the day prior. They hanged out after school yesterday, and suddenly I was removed from all group chats. I thought she just didn't want her mom to see any of the chats. The morning after that I went to try to find the friends and all but no one was there so I kinda just went to class. After my first period I walked my usual pathway trying to find the girl but she still wasn't there? And then suddenly I get hit with this long message. I got most of what they said and realized how I could be in the wrong.. the thing is, the things they told me I do, are some of the things trust do to me back. For example when I moved to the school I was nothing like them, but when I started talking to them suddenly they changed me and changed my humour and tbh I don't find anything they say funny, but I pretend I do to try and fit in with them.. but I don't find anything funny. Everyday I have to fake laugh. Yet they texted saying that my humour wasn't funny and they were feeling that I shifted them into bad people with my HUMOUR. Which is basically their humour. That's the thing that made me SO mad. Extremely hypocritical. Right now I'm in the bathroom crying. I hate to be dramatic like this but it's the fourth time and this time I might've lost half of my friends. They always do this, they act happy and find the day before, then suddenly I'm a terrible person. I'm so frustrated and this time I'm definitely not \"going\" back. They made everything so awkward and the thing that pissed me off the most is when they ended the message with \"Love u!!\" Like what the actual f do you mean love u!!! Fakest shi ever. One girl even texted me as if nothing happened. That was so not fun!!! I'm just confused why I get dropped so easily since a lot of people tell me that I am fun to be around and really nice? Am I the problem or is it this certain friend group.. keep in mind they have known each other for like four to eight years and I've only known them for two. (Not even basically one and a half with all the up and downs) I wanna know if maybe you've been in this situation and how u dealt with it or if you were the girls dropping someone maybe I could get your pov to understand a little better.

This might get long so I can only apologise.\n\nI have been best Friends with Matt (Fake name) since High school, we're both in our late twentys now but have manged to maintain a good friendship. We both met our partners around the same time 7 years ago and all was fine. Truthfully I always got a weird vibe from Matt's partner, so did the rest of our friends but he seemed happy so we were supportive. Around a year ago, Matt had lost some weight, he wasn't overweight but he said he wanted to get abit skinnier. Which was fair enough, but then he told me he was doing this by taking his partners diabetes medication and I went mad at him! I told him he was putting  himself at risk, he could easily get his partner into trouble for this. I probably went harder than I should have but I couldn't believe how stupid he was doing this! A few months go by and he told me that he wasn't taking this medication anymore & now he was fasting. In the last few months he has lost a lot of weight, to the point where he's starting to look sick. I've asked him if he's alright & how he's lost it so quick, again he said it was dieting but I didn't believe him. Last time I seen him I actually gasped because he looked so awful! His clothes hang off him, his face is starting to sink in and he looks so weak. He was shivery and just not the person I used to know but he keep saying \"I have more weight to lose\" and he pinches his stomach or his thigh but its only skin? There no fat there to lose! I've told him all of this, that he looks sick, if he loses anymore it won't be fat, it'll be muscle but he's determined to lose more & more weight. \n\nDuring these few months we have all noticed he's pulling away from us, we all talk in a group chat and Matt used to be the loudest one and now there's hardly anything from him, he won't message anyone unless we message first and even then its 1 or 2 word answers and a few days ago we all found our that Matt never stopped taking his partners medication, this whole time he's been taking it. We don't know how their getting away with it or if their buying it online or on the street but my heart broke when I found out. I believe he's now addicted to the medication & the weight loss. \n\nI don't know what to do, I don't know how to help or what to say anymore. I have never had any experience involving addiction or eating disorders. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated \u2764\ufe0f",

You miss seeing him and his presents in the group chat. Let him know you all are there for him and it\u2019s a safe space to talk about any struggles he\u2019s going through. If that doesn\u2019t work I would try talking to the partner and family. See if they\u2019ve noticed anything or if there\u2019s something going on behind-the-scenes and saying you\u2019re a really confused friend.",

If he doesn't open up, talking to one his family members or if you are comfortable talking to his partner about it then that would be your best bet. Letting others know that there's a concern you have about his wellbeing will raise awareness for the people around him and hopefully sorta force him to realize that he needs to get some sort of therapy about it or at least talk about it.",

Not just a comment here and there  like \"You are thin enough\" or \"You look sick\". Almost like an intervention- You need to sit down and tell him you are concerned he has an eating disorder and that the medication he's taking is harming his health in a serious tone. Ask him seriously, what is wrong, how hes been feeling, why does he feel this way. I would ask him how he's feeling lately and be serious about it, not just you casually asking. Be calm but serious. If he opens up any emotions that would be a good sign that he can at least open up. But at the end of the day you cannot force someone to open their feelings to you or be honest with themselves- They have to want to do it.\n\nYou can suggest therapy of course but only if hes willing to admit he has a problem first. You can only do so much for someone but they have to want to help themselves and be willing to admit they have a problem in order to fix it.",

        "text": "(Full story)\n\nI've noticed, not too long ago, that my close friend had been tired all day and most likely not sleeping. She did tell me the reason why and it was because she got a boyfriend online (on discord). The most disturbing factor is that she is still a minor (for privacy reasons I'll keep all ages secret) and she had lied about her age to an adult \"just for fun\".\n\nI had a hard time believing when she told me she was actually in love because it had all started off as a troll for shits and giggles.\n\nI was fine and all, I didn't really care if she had a boyfriend or not since she's not allowed to date anyways and I'm not generally interested in other people's relationship status. But soon enough, she had slowly become more and more distracted, skipping classes and ignoring me or acting like nothing's wrong.\n\nI've known her for about 4 years and half years and I feel guilty for even thinking about ending out friendship. Even though I know it's natural for people to change like that, it's probably selfish for wanting her to stay how she was always like.\n\nI don't know how to tell her I'm upset at her for what she's done, and although we've had a couple of serious conversations surrounding the whole boyfriend situation, neither of us mentioned anything about how are friendship was slowly falling apart. So what should I say or do?",

        "post-author": "Major_Ad_205",
        "text": "Hi, I (20f) have been friends with my new friend (21f) for almost a year now. \n\nBack in November was my friends birthday. For her birthday she just wanted to go to the mall with a group of her friends. The group was : Me, Her, Her fianc\u00e9 at the time, his friend, her high school best friend (20m call him Mike ), and my now ex best friend. The hole time me and Mike were low-key flirting nothing crazy just little playful comments. After that day Mike had told her, he liked me just didn\u2019t know how to talk to me. She told him to go for it, but he said he didn\u2019t really know what he wanted at the time.\n\nFast forward to New Years this year ~\n\n Me, my friend, Mike, and my ex friend were all hanging out at his house. We did a candy bowl trend, secret Santa, just a low-key kind of party. Well the party turned crazy real quick. Now unlike normal New Year\u2019s parties we were supposed to have no alcohol at the party bc my friend was pregnant and I would be driving everyone home so it would have only been two people drinking when there was only four of us. \n\nWell my ex friend asked Mike to get some alcohol for mimosas. My friend didn\u2019t know this till we walked into Mikes house and was confused but didn\u2019t say anything about the alcohol. As the night went on me and Mike were flirty but still keeping it respectful. Till both Mike and my ex friend got crazy drunk. Long story short they ended up making out multiple times!!! In the Kitchen, on the floor, in my car!!! Me and my friend were in shock bc the whole time Mike was saying he liked me but then went and did that.\n\nAfter a day we went and talked to Mike, my friend explained her feelings about everything and I told him I just felt misguided and confused. He apologized and took accountability for what he did and said it was REALLY messed up. After talking they brought me home and I thought that was the end. However my friend calls me saying Mike still liked me and wanted to try again in a few months bc of everything that happened. I told her IF he played his cards right maybe. \n\n~ Fast forward to March ~\n\nMike worked at a local store in our town and I would occasionally see him when he\u2019s working.  This one day I was on the phone with my friend and joking, saying I should go find Mike I end up finding him and he\u2019s being really rude and I can tell he wasn\u2019t having a good day saying \u201cI didn\u2019t wanna talk and for me to go away\u201d. I was upset about the way he talk to me bc I understand people have bad days, but he didn\u2019t need to take it out on me. \n\nThe next week, back in the store with two of my friends who know about Mike and my ex friend (they don\u2019t like either of them bc of what happened). He calls me asking if I\u2019m in the store and ask for me to go back to the juice aisle. I was reluctant at first, but chose to go anyway with my friends following behind me, Mike wanted to apologize for the way he talk to me and offered to buy us some drinks bc we had an event going on that weekend. I accepted his apology and took the drinks. \n\nOn my way back to bring Mike\u2019s card. I told my friends not to come bc I thought I would be fine and could get a second with him alone. I returned his card and he asked me about my friends I said, \u201cwhat about them\u201d and he says, \u201care they single\u201d I looked at him and told him, \u201cfuck you, you\u2019re an asshole\u201d slap him and left. \n\nI call my friend to tell her what happened and she couldn\u2019t believe it bc Mike was never like this in high school and she didn\u2019t know what was going on with him. They then got into a fight about it bc of misunderstanding from both of them talking about different topics, but Mike makes the comment, \u201cshe\u2019s cool and all but mostly a friend of a friend\u201d. Talking about me, safe to say I was done with Mike romantically after that. But our friend was on my side bc Mike had just gone from making out with my now ex best friend of 6 years to asking if my new friends were single without any context, apparently it was for his coworker. \n\nNow I would still hear about him bc my friend was still friends with him but I didn\u2019t care.\n\n~ Fast forward to May ~ \n\nSince that day as far as I know, my friend and Mike hadn\u2019t really seen each other (except his birthday and I was with them, I said a really f*cked up thing to Mike and made the day really awkward. I felt horrible and apologized multiple times about it. Me and my friend were able to work it out bc she knew I didn\u2019t mean any ill will behind what I said and could see how bad I felt). Anyway for months, I had been by my friends side as she was a freshly new mom and going through a lot of things with her baby daddy (they are now no longer together). Then one day out of the blue my friend tells me she was just hang out with Mike. I didn\u2019t think much of it he\u2019s her high school best friend so whatever. \n\nTwo days later, she calls me saying that something happened between them. I ask her what and she\u2019s like \u201cit\u2019s crazy it doesn\u2019t make any sense\u201d, and I\u2019m like \u201cdid y\u2019all kiss or something?\u201d And she says \u201cyes\u201d. I didn\u2019t know what to think at first, but I really honestly didn\u2019t care. I\u2019m more concerned about her, considering she just got out of a toxic relationship and Mike has kind of shown that he\u2019s been going through girls in the past few months between me, my ex friend, some coworker, and now our mutual friend. I feel my friend is in a very vulnerable state right now as she\u2019s still a new mom and going through all these life-changing events. \n\nIt\u2019s been almost three weeks and they are officially together and she has moved in with him. Like I just said, I really don\u2019t care that they\u2019re in a relationship. But my other friends are making me question if a good friend would get with someone they knew I had some history with and they were lowkey an a*shole to me. \n\nBut I feel that bc the two of them were friends before I came in the picture I can\u2019t say or tell them they shouldn\u2019t be together bc it\u2019s \u201cbreaking girl code\u201d. I can see how some would see it like that but I honestly don\u2019t care what Mike does with his life. I just care about my friend and if she is making the right decision. So should I be upset and is she a bad friend for getting with her high school best friend after everything?",

        "post-author": "RedIndigodust",
        "text": "\nHi Reddit, I (F32) have been friends with Lena (F37) for the past 7 years. We've had a good friendship overall, although we\u2019re quite different when it comes to social media.\n\nLena loves social media. It\u2019s her favorite way to connect with people, and she often shares photos from her many travels on Instagram. I, on the other hand, don\u2019t use social media publicly and generally prefer not to message or interact there. I\u2019ve explained this to her before.\n\nRecently, I wanted to be supportive and see Lena\u2019s travel posts, so I reactivated an old, blank Facebook account under a false name. No pictures, and I only followed two people I used to be friends with (one of whom I had bad blood with in the past but never bothered to unfollow).\n\nI sent Lena a follow request and messaged her privately to let her know it was me behind the account so she wouldn\u2019t be confused. Her response really hurt me:\n\n\u201cHi Alex, I appreciate you thinking of me and inviting me to your fake account. I\u2019m not really comfortable adding it and it doesn\u2019t align with how I prefer to connect with people online. I\u2019ve always preferred to connect with people on social media where I can see their real profiles and know who they say they are. I also noticed you follow ex-friend and vice-versa after you talked badly about how you felt when she missed out on your wedding. This does not sit right with me and I\u2019m sure you will do the same or have done the same about me. It reflects poorly on your character, Alex. I don\u2019t know what the intention is behind this fake profile and I hope you reflect on that and understand where I\u2019m coming from. Thanks.\u201d\n\nI was honestly shocked and hurt by her message. I never had bad intentions. I explained in my reply that I was just trying to support her content and didn\u2019t want to create a public profile. I also let her know I hadn\u2019t thought about the ex-friends I was still following\u2014it was an old account, and I didn\u2019t clean it up. I apologized if it came off wrong.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t opened or responded to my message since.\n\nNow I\u2019m sitting here wondering if I should reach out again, or just wait for her to contact me. I feel blindsided by how quickly she jumped to judgment and told me my actions reflected poorly on my character.\n\nWas I wrong for using a blank profile? Should I try to explain myself again or give her space? How would you handle this situation?\n\n\n",

Ending a friendship is always going to suck, the only thing you are avoiding by blocking is seeing their reaction, which with toxic people I find is not smart because they can react very negatively so having the opportunity to deescalate is actually helpful. \n\nThe point is that they understand why the relationship ended so they can have closure and maybe be a better friend to their other friends. \n\nSo just rip the bandaid.

        "text": "Ok, so Im going to vent a little and I want some outside perspective too. I (25F) got close to my other coworker (30F), we worked long shifts together so naturally you get close to the people you work with. I know the whole coworkers aren\u2019t your friend\u2019s argument. But honestly I work long hours and it\u2019s hard to make friends outside of work sometimes. Anyways, me and this coworker would hang outside of work too. Multiple times. Tbh when she first came on board on my shift, her and I would have lots of disagreements on topics and we would get into heated discussions at times. But in the end we would somehow still be chill about it afterwards. There were times that she would do weird stuff to me too, like she would sit on me if other females were around, or she would show me intimate photos of her and I would just ignore it. (Disclaimer she has a \u2018partner\u2019 Female) one time she was showing me some restaurants she\u2019s been too, and I looked at her once, and she said \u201cwhy you looking at me like that?\u201d I said \u201chow?\u201d She\u2019s said \u201clike you love me.\u201d I just gave her a confused look. She smirked. And said \u201cdont make me play gay chicken with you\u201d I said \u201cI\u2019m good dude\u201d. She would use my IG to chat with her partner, weird ain\u2019t it? Like not even her partner would call her out on it. When we both went on a new shift, and she got put in a different work location, she somehow was able to get access to hers, and I called her out on it and said..\u201dyou couldn\u2019t have done this a while back?\u201d She answered \u201cno not at all\u201d. This upset me because she started acting really weird with me when we were on this new shift. Like super distant. But yet, she would share intimate shit about herself to me, like her past, stuff about her family, she would send me a video of one of her parents opening a gift on Christmas Day. She went on a trip with her gf\u2019s family, and would blow my phone up with memes, and even said \u201cwake tf up, I\u2019m laughing by myself\u201d like dude tf isn\u2019t your partner there with you??? When we were working together we would send meme\u2019s non stop to each other, and I will admit that\u2019s the biggest issue of today, social media. To me meme\u2019s are surface level type stuff, yes you send certain memes to certain people (well at least I do, I probably only send memes to three people and that\u2019s it, because we have stuff in common) we would jam out to music at work all the time and it was fun, we would crack jokes at each other. She tends to send me weird memes at times like, \u201cimagine we robbing a bank, and in the end it\u2019s not the money I want it\u2019s you\u201d like bro wtf?? This one is weird as shit, and random but\u2026she explained the movie gone girl to me (I have never watched it) but she just went into explicit detail about sex scenes. That was all. I sat there confused as shit. I don\u2019t ever really open up about my life, unless I feel like you\u2019ve deserved to hear about it. So I eventually opened up to her and let her hear my full story, my childhood, things I struggle with. \n\nFast forward to today\u2026she got a new spot, and tbh it\u2019s nice seeing good people like her get promoted she deserves it 110%. I understand life is busy af, well not mine tbh it\u2019s boring, but she does send memes from time to time. I recently asked her if we could hang out one day, she said \u201cof course what\u2019s your schedule?\u201d She even offered to take a day off during the work week, I told her it\u2019s ok, don\u2019t waste a sick day on that. We both are available Sunday\u2019s she said ok Sundays work better. I asked her if she wanted to this Sunday, next, or the following\u2026she answered with not this Sunday but I think the next one\u2026she said she had to check her work calendar, I told her ok lmk me know\u2026.Sunday came around and she never told me\u2026.it was also my bad I should have followed up on Friday or maybe end early Saturday. So I messaged her again and asked hey dude did you pick a day suitable, so we can do a quick food run? She said she was busy this week, maybe the following Sunday? I said ok this date then? She said I think that works\u2026.i just answered with a ok and a thumbs up. \n\nI\u2019m just kind of annoyed with the fact that, dude you\u2019ve told me no before with other things, what difference does it make now? We\u2019ve told each other out of pocket shit\u2026just be upfront with me, and then hey I\u2019ll know where this stands, maybe you just want it on the meme base level, and that\u2019s ok. But just let me know, it\u2019s not hard\u2026she\u2019s always claiming to be \u201creal\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019ll know if I don\u2019t like you\u201d ok then be real with me. \n\nAny advice? ",

Basically she insisted me on going to an event with her and i agreed because i thought it would be nice to spend some good tome w her but during the event, she dumped me, went to hang out with her boyfriend instead and i had to spend the event w people i do not even know properly. It was obvious she used me to het permission from her parents and actually wanted to hang out w him instead. I do not want to forgive her for what she did even though she apologised cause disrespect was way too loud, but since these are last days of college I was thinking should i approach and bid good bye and tell her i forgive her? I feel like i would regret it later on if i did. Im not sure so please tell me what i should do. ",

The other day, I was lamenting to my supposed best friend that I am having a hard time lately because perimenopause is kicking my ass, I work full time, still raising 3 teenagers, and have been having a harder and harder time being there for my parents. My parents recently asked for me to step it up and help them EVEN MORE and I told them I couldn't. \n\nI was explaining to this friend the conversation and she said, \"Well, we're just at that age where we have to go see our parents more than once a week!\"\n\nWe then changed the subject and didn't come back around to it. Later, I texted her asking her how often she goes to see HER parents. She responded that she sees them once a week for 6 weeks out of the year when her youngest is in an after school sport by their house. And now, since they are in hospital, she sees them every other day. Then she asked me why I was asking, which I did not answer. She's been calling me every day since.\n\nI've been frustrated with our friendship for a while now and I couldn't put my finger on it until now. She constantly gives advice she hasn't ever taken and may not ever be in the position to take. She doesn't have elderly disabled parents, yet. She doesn't have teenagers, yet- but she's constantly telling me how SHE would parent them. Etc., etc., ad nauseam. ",

        "text": "I (34F) have been close friends with a woman (36F) for over 7 years. We met at work, and even though she left the company, we stayed in touch. We speak every 2-3 days, often for hours - sometimes about how miserable I am at work, other times about life in general. I\u2019ve stayed at her home, met her family, and we\u2019ve been emotionally close.\n\nLast week, she suddenly stopped responding. No replies to texts or calls. I messaged on Instagram - nothing. She lives with her parents, so I wasn\u2019t immediately alarmed, but I was still worried. After 4 days of complete silence, I reached out to a couple of mutuals. One said they met her recently and she seemed fine, but now even they couldn\u2019t get in touch.\n\nStill anxious, I messaged her cousin (in another city) on Instagram, just to check in. No response. Finally, I tried calling her mom - I don\u2019t speak her language, and her mom doesn\u2019t text, but I was genuinely concerned. The call was disconnected after two rings. I didn\u2019t follow up again.\n\nLater that day, I got a barrage of angry messages from my friend. She said I \u201ccrossed a line\u201d by involving her family and had \u201cruined\u201d the peace she was trying to preserve. Her cousin had apparently alerted her parents after my message. She told me she just wanted quiet and that I should have waited.\n\nI told her I was just worried. But she accused me of being \u201ccreepy,\u201d playing detective, and not respecting her space. I feel completely blindsided. If she had just told me she needed time off, I would\u2019ve respected it. But I wasn\u2019t expecting to be ghosted - not by someone I speak to every 2-3 days.\n\nI feel like she set invisible boundaries and then got mad at me for crossing them. It feels like the friendship is on her terms - she can disappear, and I\u2019m not supposed to care. She never turned her phone off. I\u2019m sure she saw my missed calls and messages, and still chose to say nothing, even knowing I might worry. It had to be a conscious decision to put her phone on mute and lock it up, knowing people may try reaching out. I know mental breakdowns can't be planned, but she could go 5 days in front of her parents, masking anything was wrong. So it had to be a conscious breakdown.\n\nI eventually apologized for \u201ccaring\u201d and told her I wouldn\u2019t reach out again. But now I feel deeply let down by the friendship. Am I wrong for having reached out to her family? Was it really such a violation? \n ",

You knew she was basically OK from your mutual.\n\nApologizing for \u201ccaring\u201d sounds passive aggressive and dismissive. You aren\u2019t sorry you cared. She wasn\u2019t mad that you cared.

I just keep comforting her, not realizing that its taking the time i should take care with myself. She has other friends to rant to with life too. Her churchmates, there\u2019s this specific one she keeps telling me about and keeps yapping about her. It hurts my heart, maybe she only needed me when she didnt have friends. Now that she has them she may not need me anymore. Me right now does not have friends to rant to about my health, my life. Im just alone while she can keep talking to her favorite churchmate. Im not saying that its bad but I feel like she doesnt need me anymore. Our friendship is very unbalanced. I comfort her, but she doesnt know how to comfort me. While I rant she always says \u201cits okay\u201d smth like that then changes the subject to what happened in her day. While I comfort her completely in her lowest, when everyone leaves her except me. Call me selfish but I actually am selfless and a people pleaser.",

        "text": "I have had a best friend for the past 15 years who has struggled a lot with mental health issues which are usually triggered by rejection (romantic, professional, etc. ) I have been her friend through it all - sometimes giving advice/tough love, distracting her with activities/tv/movies, and sometimes just sitting with her listening to her vent. I try to ask how I can be supportive and what she needs from me so I don\u2019t overstep or not be there as much as she needs me. \n\nRecently we have both gone through break ups. I have started seeing someone new who makes me incredibly happy and treats me well. My friend has had a few dating experiences where she doesn\u2019t like the person and doesn\u2019t want to date them but stays to feel chosen or \u201cfor the attention\u201d and then feels like her world is crumbling when the person breaks it off with her. It\u2019s almost like doomsday every time it happens. \n\nWe\u2019ve gone through a period of a few months now where I\u2019ve felt used as an emotional punching bag and like any help or new perspective I try to offer is scoffed at. She is only interested in talking negatively about things and right now im at a place in my life where I want to focus on the things that are going good. \n\nIt seems like right now she is not in a place to celebrate my happiness because she is so depressed. I can accept that (even though it sucks) and I go so far as to not mention my new relationship or really any positive thing in my life at all since I only have great things to say. But I\u2019m at a total loss for how I can be there for her when I\u2019m not able to be happy around her, can\u2019t convince her to be happy or change her perspective on things, and even sitting with her while she cries feels awkward. \n\nWhat should I do?\n\n\n",

We have been drifting for nearly a year now I'd say, and what's funny is she pulled the plug because she didn't feel I was there for her. What is extra funny is that I've been the one consistently reaching out to her, though it's naturally become more sparse overtime as she consistently cancels and never initiates conversations. To be honest it's a relief, because it's felt imbalanced for a long while now. I am honestly so sick of the negativity with 0 understanding that I also have my own life and struggles, the lack of check ins, etc. In my opinion I think you should just slow fade out, at least keep a bit more distance from her as if you try to force yourself to hang out you'll be no fun anyway, and sometimes distance is necessary. It may even make the heart grow fonder.",

She could never be happy for her friends and always made someone else\u2019s success and moment of celebration a sob story about herself. No matter what I\u2019d say or do, she was unwilling to listen and actively make changes to better her life. Another friend and I suspected she had undiagnosed mental health issues, but every time we tried to gently bring up the fact that she needed to get help, she\u2019d shoot it down as if it was a shameful thing. (Funny enough, the other friend is studying to be a psychologist, and she\u2019d always heavily emphasize the importance of mental health to her face while actively denying needing to prioritize her own.) \n\nMy point is, there\u2019s nothing more you can do. If she is unwilling to change or at least try, then you can\u2019t force her to. From what you\u2019ve shared, just know you tried your best.

Not to be rude ofcourse! If she is or not doesnt matter right now but she seems like she needs therapy and if youre starting to feel awkward around her and being around this best friend of yours is just about negativity maybe you should tell her all this youre saying here. I think if she hears you out she would be able to fix it and maybe say sorry,i get youve been friends for 15 years so breaking things up with her would be heartcrushing (maybe??) or you just want her to get better etc etc whatever you want to do i would say tell her how youre feeling and maybe try talking about the good things in her life - also wanted to say you seem like an AMAZING friend for being so nice to her and everything,helping out and stuff like you said in paragraph 1 ,distracting her by watching stuff honestly thats respectful.-have a good day/night/morning/evening hope this helps!!!

Anyway, in the last five years she started to talk in circles because she didn\u2019t have any novelty in her life, as she refused every possible experience using the excuse that she was \u201cintroverted\u201d. After a while I got bored when I listened to her and at the same time I couldn\u2019t really share my life because I didn\u2019t want to make her feel somehow behind or because she didn\u2019t appreciate the subject. She was miserable and at some point decided to emigrate to a new country. I was happy for her thinking she would have had the courage to go out there, meet new people, do fun activities. nobody expected her to change completely but it was reasonable to expect some novelty. Long story short, she passed 6 months constantly unsatisfied because I wasn\u2019t there for her to chat or call 24/7 (I had my life and we spoke everyday anyway), she grew resentful until she accused me of being a monster and abandoning her etc. \nStay safe. People like this usually just want to use you to feel alive because they can\u2019t be alive on their own. Of course you must love each other, but her negativity is a cage that she built to have a false sense of control and security. This kind of people suck you dry and then grow resentful when you no longer can support their delusion.",

I believe it's everyone's responsibility to take ownership of their well-being wherever possible and take proper steps to ensure that your well being keeps momentum whenever possible and that includes when your friends drain your energy.  Whether that be though therapy, medication,  hobbies, exercise etc, because while it's great to have good friends who will be your emotional sounding board from time to time, it doesn't give anyone a free pass to take advantage of that.  \n\nI have poor mental health and I know I've been an emotional dumper from time to time but I also know when enough is enough.   That takes self awareness and that doesn't come easy.  I had to really look inward and practice that so I could still maintain my close friendships without dragging them down with me whenever I go through something.    I have a therapist for that.  \n\nBoundaries are so important too.  If you're finding that your friend is draining you, and she starts to emotionally dump on you without considering your capacity to take it on, you could always set a boundary around that and smoothly change the subject.  \n\nAlso, a boundary includes not always making yourself available to her.  Do you find you give her access to you too easily??  If so, you can change that by limiting how soon you respond, and if you choose, only respond to her when you have the mental capacity to do so.  \n\nBut boundaries may help you a great deal in this case.",

        "text": "Hello, everyone. I made a post not too long ago detailing a current situation I have going on with my best friend, but I needed some new advice (any and all is appreciated). Also, please don\u2019t mind the rambling and any grammatical errors. \n\n\nTo make long story short, my best friend (F22) and I (F22) have basically gone no-contact, only communicating once over text and once in person over the past couple of months. This might sound like a normal thing, but it\u2019s very unusual for us. Usually, we make sure to video call at least once a week and catch up. Since I was finishing up with my last year of college and she\u2019s working on her master\u2019s, we both were very busy. However, now that the school year is over, she has barely reached out to me. For context, I asked her to chat at least three times (once a week) leading up to the start of April, and she declined each time because she was busy with schoolwork. So, eventually, I stopped asking because I assumed she would let me know whenever she found some free time. Fast forward a month later, she tells me that school was killing her, but she could finally talk or even meet up. Even though I whole-heartedly believe her, I couldn\u2019t help but feel upset that she didn\u2019t feel the need to send a quick text, especially because she texts her long-distance boyfriend every morning and every night, sometimes even for hours. So, when we finally did meet up at my house a few days before my graduation the second week of May (that she couldn\u2019t attend), she sensed that something was wrong with me and that I wasn\u2019t in the mood. Still, we had a decent conversation and things went well (or so I thought). Since she had given me a gift, I texted her afterward, thanking her. And because I was feeling emotional, I also expressed how I love spending time with her and that that\u2019s the biggest gift she could give me in hopes that she would bring something up about us meeting or chatting like we used to. Her family are my neighbors, so it has always been very convenient for us to hang out. Now that she lives in the city about an hour away, she suggested that I come over. This is something that hasn\u2019t been possible for me because live with my parents and disabled grandma, and we only have one car to share. It\u2019s something I think she knows very well, too. Since then, we haven\u2019t spoken. \n\nWe have been friends for nearly 15 years and were very close to each other, like sisters. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t help but feel almost a sense of betrayal. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s upset with me, but I\u2019m not sure why she would be, considering I\u2019ve always tried to be there for her. In fact, there are a few other reasons that I didn\u2019t detail in this post as to why I\u2019m upset with her because I feel like she\u2019s being hypocritical and dishonest with me. \n\nHer birthday is next week, but she\u2019ll be off meeting her long-distance boyfriend almost a year after getting together. I need to give her a gift and birthday card before she goes (as she did to me for my birthday a few months ago), but to be honest, I don\u2019t have the courage to face her. I cry myself to sleep every night, wondering how we got here, why I\u2019m not important to her anymore, and why she doesn\u2019t care enough to reach out to me. We had this entire plan that she\u2019d FaceTime me from overseas to keep me updated and ask for my advice, but it seems like none of that will be happening now, which makes me sad. Please give me guidance in this situation. ",

People do get busy, and it\u2019s socially encouraged in our society to prioritize romantic relationships over friendships. \n\nPut yourself in her shoes. You are stressed with school, trying to make a long distance relationship work, and now one of your closest friends isn\u2019t being supportive of that journey and is instead asking \u2018what about me?\u2019 And thinking she\u2019s dishonest, not trusting her, and though you want to see her, circumstances don\u2019t permit it because she\u2019s dealing with a tough family situation.\n\nI\u2019m dealing with the same issue, but ultimately you have to understand she\u2019s not trying to hurt you, quite the opposite, she wants your happiness and she probably does want to connect but you\u2019ve built this defensive posture because you\u2019ve more or less decided unilaterally this friendship won\u2019t work. You stopped trying because she was busy, and are mad at her for being busy, but she can\u2019t exactly drop everything and move back home for your sake.\n\nIt\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t care enough to reach out, it\u2019s that right now she\u2019s focused on other things that are more immediately relevant to her life. The question I have, is why don\u2019t you? \n\nIncluding saying she\u2019s dishonest and hypocritical, why are you judging your best friend like this? I get missing her, I get that you aren\u2019t going into those details, but if she\u2019s those things, if you really meant those words, why would you want her to reach out?\n\nThis is not about her. This is about you. What do you want? How do you get it? Those are the immediately relevant questions. \n\nYour relationships through life will change because life changes. You can either accept those changes with grace and understanding or insecurity but at the end of the day, the change is inevitable. What you do about it, that\u2019s where your ability to control lay.\n\nShe isn\u2019t betraying you by going after what she wants and prioritizing those things. If she\u2019s doesn\u2019t want what you want, find someone who does, don\u2019t blow up the existing relationship. \n\nI would get her a nice gift, and write a letter expressing how important a person she is/was in your life. Express your feelings sincerely and focus on the positive. \n\nAnd do some self-care. Find new relationships to fill the void this one has left in your heart. But there\u2019s no point trying to force the impossible, you push on something too much it is bound to break. \n\nAccept that your \u2018best friend\u2019 may not be your \u2018best\u2019 friend forever, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should lose the friendship. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be supportive of her and ask her to be supportive of you in whatever way you can. \n\nAnd who knows? Maybe you are absolutely wrong. Maybe those FaceTime calls are coming, and if you blow up the relationship over insecurity, you both lose out on what you really want.",

We talked practically everyday and for hours some days too. I have never felt so empty and alone in my life. They weren\u2019t just my best friend but at some points my only friend. I feel that I will never get over it and it\u2019s been extremely difficult ever since and I haven\u2019t felt any better. It was mostly my fault to be honest, I said some things I shouldn\u2019t have said but I completely regretted it and tried to tell her. A difficult part about it is that we were never able to even try and talk about what happened and instead she just ended it. The most difficult part of it and the hardest thing to understand and process is that about a month after she cut it off she messaged me one night and we had a quick texting conversation that she started and seemed engaged and even happy in. So I thought after that maybe there was a chance. But after few days after that she blocked me on everything and that was just crushing. Because it\u2019s not like she did that at the beginning, she did it after a seemingly good and positive conversation that she started. I just don\u2019t understand why she would do that and it just adds more hurt to what I\u2019m already feeling. I\u2019m just seeing if anyone has any suggestions of how to get over this emotionally because I don\u2019t see myself feeling any better.",

Then after few days into the relationship, we barely talk to eachother and even if we did talk, it's just her and her relationship. I'm always bit hurt about her nonchalant behaviour as a friend. But now she's being a bad person is my last straw. Because I felt now only it's me carrying the friendship and she's okay let go of it. So I told her that it's better if we don't talk to eachother at all. She didn't respond to it. So yh am I the problem?? Am I overacting? For me we outgrown in that friendship and now we need to walk away. But I feels ridiculous and sad because she's part of the family. What are you thoughts guys??",

Some transferred schools, so, we couldnt hang out with them anymore, and the others were still at the same school with me. 2 years ago, it was fine at first, we still hung out but new people were introduced to us. So, weve made a couple of friends, here and there, but then Ive came to realized that I have been a floater friend all along. Because of that I have backed off in most \"friends groups\" and or any other like association with those people because they really wouldnt even mind if I wasnt there. \n\nNow, theres this one really close friend of mine that I had a misunderstanding with 2 years ago. We stopped communicating more, but still would just have a simple 2-3 sentences conversation (it was that bad of a fall out). 7-8 months ago tho, she reached out to me thru letter saying shes sorry for everything and admitted her mistakes and even asked for a reply from me. Now that, that is where I made a mistake, because I never replied to her letter but, I was going to but never had the time. We became more distant, but less awkward idk? It still felt off tho.\n\nFast forward to now, their birthday is coming up, and Im conflicted. A part of me wants to greet her because I want them to feel bad? Show them that I care?. But I also worry that the action might come across as desperate or like I'm trying to force something that's already long faded. \n\nTbh, despite everything that had happened and how much change there is in our dynamics.

        "post-author": "Jaded_Pace1035",
        "text": "Hello Reddit\n\nI (20F) have been best friend with a girl, let's call her Rene(19F) for the last four years. We have been through ups and downs together, but have always been super close. Over the last year she has started going down a bad path and I am scared for her safety and well being.\n\nWhen Rene was 17 she was in a toxic on and off relationship with this guy named Larry(20M at the time). I found out later that he was a coke dealer, addict, and heavy alcoholic. I knew some troubling things about their relationship, but I didn't learn the full story until later. They ended in and awful off and on very emotionally abusive way that commulated into him physically hurting her and permanently altering her view on relationships and herself. At the time she did not do any drugs besides drinking and smoking weed in moderation (as did I).\n\nAfter the ending of that relationship Rene became close friends with Sally (19F). Who seemed chill at first, but ended up being a horrible influence and helped to lead Rene down a path of frequent binge drinking to a concerning level (15+ drinks 5x a night level). I voiced my concerns and she would try to help herself, but would slowly slip into her new/old ways of heavy binge drinking. She also started experimenting with other drugs such as mushrooms during this time. Rene got a low grade DUI at one point, went to jail for the night, and her and Sally stopped being friends.\n\nDuring the time they stopped being friends Rene picked herself back up and seemed to be doing genuinely well for herself. She has been enrolled in cosmetology school since October and really threw herself into that during the time she was away from \"bad influences\". She had some flings with some guys that kind of seemed liked losers but nothing serious.\n\nIt all started going downhill when her and Sally started reconnecting and about a month later she told me that she had been taking cocaine and couldn't stop thinking about it. I was obviously worried. \n\nFor context previous to me and Rene being super close I was very close with a girl named Georgia that I had met in an eating disorder support group. Long story short she got into an abusive relationship, started experimenting with the drugs he gave her, and she gradually became a full fledged alcoholic and coke addict even after they broke up. I cut her off because I didn't want to be around that and from mutual friends I hear that she is even deeper into her addiction and average coke users can't stand to be around her.\n\nAfter hearing about Rene doing coke I feared that she would go down the same path as Georgia. I told Rene how worried and sad I was and told her she should really tell her mom about everything. She did end up telling her mom and I also talked to her mom in order to make sure there was really a clear line of communication. Rene thought I was being a good friend and she knew that is what had to be done and her mom repeatedly said how greatful she was I got involved. Things went well for a while until she reconnected with her awful friend Sally. Her and Sally were hanging out and Sally said hey let's go to my friends house and Rene was like okay cool. She took her to a neighboring town that is INTERNATIONALLY known for being a bad area. I have met Europeans who recognize that as being the place you DO NOT GO TO. When they got there Rene noticed people were cooking crack and multiple men in their 30s were there. Rene wanted to leave and Sally proceded to immediately down hard alcohol and not take her home. Rene ended up doing what she thought was cocaine, but actually ended up being meth. (I found out later that during this time period Rene was doing a lot of cocaine alone and in groups). However afterwards one of the 30 year old men tried to get her to smoke some of the crack he was cooking and tried to have sex with her multiple times. Rene is pretty sure Sally might have been trying to pimp her out. So Rene called a friend who lived 10 minutes away to come get her. Rene's friend Molly (19F) and Molly's friend Stacy (19F). Immediately after Rene left someone called her off of Stacy's phone saying that Stacy took something and was unresposive. Rene went back to check on Sally (Molly and Stacy went into the house with her), but Sally was fine when they showed up, They went to leave and a dog (that was in the house) attacked Molly and Stacy and Stacy ended up needing to be airlifted to the nearest hospital for treatment. Both girls who got attacked survived and recovered and Rene completely cut off Sally.\n\nOnce again I thought it was all over and Rene would go back to her old self. That is until Rene started dating Brad (20 M) 3 months ago. Brad seemed fine at first. He seemed straight laced, he was from the suburbs, and had graduated highschool. He seemed to treat her well and she was happy. Until he threatened her with a loaded gun and cocked it at her because she visited a friend and he thought she was cheating on him. She got her mom to help get her out and called me. I obviously told her that he was abuisve and literally threatened her life and Rene said she would leave him. She didn't. Turns out Brad is a big coke head, pill popping loser. He yells at her, verbally demeans her, and gaslights her and that's just the stuff she tells me. Rene told me that multiple people in HIS LIFE have pulled her aside and asked if he hits her. She says he doesn't but I feel like he does or at least the threat is there. About a week ago he got arrested for having 1lbs+ of weed in his car(it is illegal in our state), running from the cops in his car at 100mphs in a residental zone, and hitting and totaling a police car amoung many other misdemeanors. He want to jail and she and her friends and his parents pooled togther his bail to get him out of jail before his court date. His court date is later this month, but today he hid 200 weed pens in her car without her knowledge. A felonly level of weed. In her car. Without her knowledge. I believe that she is back on drugs due to her not sleeping at night, irrated nose, constant sniffing, etc, but when I asked she said she wasn't.\n\nI have no idea what to do in this scenario as her friend. I'm in the middle of a degree at a good college and do not step into the world that she is currently involved in. I've never been in legal trouble or experimented with anything harder than weed and am hoping I never will. I'm worried that she is going to end up doing heavier drugs or straight up killing herself with regular or laced cocaine. But maybe her boyfriend will go to jail for a while and she will end up picking herself back up. But even if that happens I'm worried she will just latch onto the next person involved in the drug scene. Her boyfriend is appartently a relatively big drug dealer and I'm worried that Rene, as his gf, could potentially be violently targeted, I don't know if he is gang affliated (he does frequently go out to and deal in areas that are known for gang activity). I don't know if she would even be targeted. If I'm out in public with her could I be in danger? I honestly don't know.\n\nI don't want to give up on this friendship because I know Rene and I know how amazing of a person she is. I know that she is capable of so much in life and I want to be there for it. But at the same time I don't want to watch her slowly kill herself of put myself in harms way, But she is also in an abusive relationship. She doesn't have any friends besides me that aren't associated with him and I don't want her to feel like she has nothing outside of him. I'm honestly looking for any sort of advice from anyone because I am so confused, but I would especially love advice from someone who has been in mine or Rene's situation.  ",

There\u2019s also no trying to explain myself because if I do, she won\u2019t listen no matter what I say, nor will the best friend, and btw, I\u2019m forced to be around the best friend to be able to hang out with my other friend since they\u2019re around each other like 75% of the time.",

                "body": "There are many different ways you could deal with the situation. My favorite being, next time she screams at you, punch her straight in the face then say sorry you startled me when you screamed. You could also talk to the one doing the screaming telling her that if she has something to say to you, she can say it like normal people do. If the other friend opens her mouth to stick up for the other one, point out the fact that it is between you and the other person and her opinion is not needed. There is no need to drag others into the situation. Another strategy would be to hang with other people who are less screamy. Don't bother calling either one out or try getting others against them. Just straight up walk away without saying a word. You could get creative and use the face punch one without saying a word. Throw the punch and coldly walk away without saying a word.",

But for the last 2 years our friendship just doesn\u2019t feel the same. \n\nI still respect her as person and we have similar interests. But, she\u2019s just so flaky the past 2 years, I feel like I\u2019m constantly trying to invite her to hangout and she barely agrees. She never initiates the hangouts herself. I have also invited her to hangout with my other friends and she never does the same with hers.\n\nI try messaging her often, I\u2019ll tell her about my life and try to ask her questions, but she\u2019s always short with her responses. So it feels like I\u2019m writing a big long wall of text about myself, but she won\u2019t do the same. Then we speak in person I\u2019ll notice her rolling her eyes about something I\u2019ve said.\n\nI thought she was my best friend and I would still love to be. But it feels like maybe she\u2019s trying to drift away. Which is so weird because I went awhile not reaching out, but then she\u2019ll message me and ask what\u2019s going on in my life.\n\nThe friendship feels weird, it feels like it\u2019s me talking, initiating, but she never really talks about herself anymore. Has anyone gone through this? I\u2019d love to remain friends if our friendship could go back to the way it was, but right now it just feels like maybe I see her as a better friend than she sees me. I don\u2019t want to lose this friendship, but maybe it\u2019s just fizzled out? Is there anyway to repair it? Or should I just accept that we are drifting apart?",

My mental health wasn't the best because of past trauma with relationships. We broke up, and I was able to have time to heal. Since January, we have been friends and have had some ups and downs. For example, sometimes I would ask him a bunch of questions about which type of nails I could get or what hairstyle I could try. Or when I would have a mental breakdown about something and just need clarification about something. He says that it gives him \"Vietnam flashbacks\" of dating me. It kinda hurt my feelings. Yeah, I know I am hard to deal with because I bottle up my emotions and just let them out randomly. The way he said that made me feel like I was a nightmare, like being around me is hell. I already have low self-esteem and questioned why he even was my friend, so it just felt terrible to hear him say that. I don't know how to go about this. I ask him what I could do to not make him feel annoyed, and he said some asking questions like that, but it's just something I ask everyone I am close to. So it just feels like I can't be my full self around him. He has seen my lowest self, and I have tried to improve so I could be a better friend to him, but it feels like I am back at step 1.",

She keeps on \"stalking\u201c me and talks very weirdly about my boyfriend.\nBasically we started being friends like December 2023, but haven\u2018t met until October last year, we had a mutual friend who was a very bad person. So it all started sweet, until she started like kinda harrassing me and kept on being on my phone, going through my messages, gets annoyed when I don\u2018t answer within 2 mins. She kinda started annoying me for while now, I told her what was wrong, she said I was ungrateful, and disrespectful as I\u2018ve said I put my family and boyfriend over my friends. I don\u2018t believe in labeling as in best friends, ect. She just sorta annoys me so much and I do not know what to do anymore.\n\nI really need help because she kept telling me I was the reason for her relapsing again, she praises my bf and I don\u2018t feel comfortable with it. Whenever I tell her, she seems to ignore it, doesn\u2018t even get into it and yk. I just can\u2018t stand her anymore, due to her fucked up behaviour all the time. We argued a lot recently, mostly about her being nosy and very disturbing. \n\nAlso whenever I tell her what kinda annoys me or so on, she just plays it off and tells me how bad of a friend I am, especially when I tell her she\u2018s not able to take any criticism or similar, and as soon as I get a slight off tone, she just tells me stuff like \u201eyeahh I know I\u2018m annoying you\u201c, which I\u2018m mostly not until I get that sentence.\n\nI\u2018d appreciate any help in that situation because I tried cutting her off, but she kind of kept saying stuff as I\u2018ve said to make me feel bad, and yeah.",

The good news about guilt, is that when someone attempts to make you feel guilty through their own shitty behavior, *you actually have a choice not to hold onto that guilt*.   Stop choosing the guilt.  Put it down.  You didn't ask to hold onto it.   Put.  It.  Down.   You are allowing her to drain you because you may also have some inner work to reflect on that causes you to hold onto things and to seek people who's behaviour is not good for you.   Let those people go.  Do NOT keep what does not serve you.  Don't go back to it.  No matter what she tries to do.  \n\nAlso, the fact that she doesn't have any real friends is NOT your problem. It never was. Stop choosing it and making it your problem.  Her addiction struggles are not your problem. They're hers.   She's using your compassion and empathy to turn you into her slave so that no matter what happens she will harness your weaknesses in order to make you continue to stay.  \n\nShow her you are not that person anymore and permanently keep your promise to yourself and work on healing yourself from this.  \n\nYou are getting some incredible advice in this post.  Take it.  But whatever you do, *stop holding onto the guilt*.  Stop letting other people control how you should feel.  Or you'll never live by your own personal standards.",

You are also not allowed to order \"unclean\" things around her, like any fish/seafood, offal, etc. When you order your food, you are not allowed to eat it until she has taken your plate and documented everything with pictures, video etc. You also need to provide a full review of the food, and take pictures eating the food, for her records. She also often heavily hints she wants everyone to order something matching, like specific drinks, for pictures, and will get very upset with you if you don't order that item.\n\nIf you don't allow her to do these things, she will get very unhappy. This can include glaring at you across the table, pouting, slapping your hands if you try to take back your plate, being passive aggressive if you mess up the documentation process, etc. She will also grab you by the arm or wrist and physically move you where she wants you to stand/sit, as she needs to choose the order in which everyone sits and where they sit. If you unintentionally mess something up she has in her head, she won't communicate it to you, as she doesn't like acknowledging the OCD (I think it embarrasses her), but she will start pouting, making fun of you passive aggressively, or get in your face and start scolding you.\n\nIs this reasonable, because of her mental health diagnosis? Or, would you also not be able to do it? ",

It's like I'm only a school friend to them. I initiate and ask to hang out and people decline. I honestly miss just having one friend and we'd hang out whenever. I feel so socially unfulfilled. I'm on my summer break now and I've felt so lonely I've been breaking down every single day.\n\nI really try my best to meet new people. I have a sport/hobby where I try to talk to people. I try to be kind and understanding to everyone. I've had problems with making/keeping friends my whole life, and I'm constantly being told that it will get better and I will find my people, and I really thought I did, but now I've never felt more alone. I feel like I'm missing out on so much.\n\nSo I'm wondering if anyone relates or has success stories or advice or anything. I've been trying so hard to find the \"right people\" literally my entire life. It sucks that I have nobody to go to except my mom, and she's at a complete loss. I'll try almost anything if it could stop the feeling where I'm alone on a Saturday night with nobody to talk to.",

        "text": "I\u2019m 28 years old, and I\u2019m starting to realize how hard it is to make real, lasting friendships as an adult.\n\nI didn\u2019t have the easiest time growing up\u2014I was kind of an outcast in middle school, went to a private school where I got picked on, and didn\u2019t really develop social skills. My home life didn\u2019t help either\u2014strict religious household, not very supportive parents, and definitely not a place I could bring friends over to hang out.\n\nIn high school, I made a few friends late in the game, and they helped me come out of my shell. I started learning how to socialize, but I noticed they were always expanding their friend groups, while mine stayed small. After graduation, I didn\u2019t go to college right away and drifted through service jobs, making work friends that never stuck around long.\n\nI\u2019ve had phases where I pushed myself to excel\u2014worked for myself for a bit, then joined my dad\u2019s construction company\u2014but it was isolating. No one wants to be friends with the boss\u2019s son. I went through a bad slump and only snapped out of it after a serious illness. That experience sort of woke me up emotionally. I started going out and exploring more, dated again, got into a relationship, and eventually left the family business.\n\nFast forward to now, I\u2019m single again, back on my feet, but looking around at my life and feeling... disconnected. I\u2019m seeing parallels between myself and my dad\u2014he has no real friends, only transactional relationships, and now he\u2019s alone and bitter. I don\u2019t want that, but I\u2019m scared I\u2019m heading in that direction.\n\nRight now, I have one friend I see maybe twice a month. We\u2019re not especially close. I\u2019ve outgrown the party scene, and I\u2019ve never really found hobbies that stick\u2014I have ADHD, and my interests tend to cycle in and out. I\u2019ve tried hiking, the gym, even dog parks. I meet people, sure, but it never goes deeper than small talk.\n\nThe truth is, I want something real. I\u2019ve always dreamed of having a close group of friends\u2014or even just one best friend\u2014I can count on, make memories with, and actually grow with over time. I don\u2019t want to keep floating between acquaintances or only connecting with people over surface-level stuff.\n\nThe problem is, I just don\u2019t know where to start. I don\u2019t struggle with small talk or meeting people\u2014I\u2019m approachable and generally well liked\u2014but I have no idea how to take that next step into meaningful connection.\n\nIf you\u2019ve managed to build real adult friendships, how did you do it? Where did you meet people who actually stuck around? How do you move beyond \u201cfriendly\u201d into \u201ctrue friend\u201d?\n\nI\u2019m working with a therapist, I\u2019ve got a stable job and I\u2019m figuring out my next steps in life with my career and goals. But I\u2019m realizing that what\u2019s also missing are people. And I want to change that before I look up one day and realize I\u2019m completely alone.",

        "text": "so basically, I've been friends with this girl for around a year now and we're online friends (if that's important) which I think it is. basically throughout this friendship it's been pretty solid. I can't think of much contention in this friendship we've been pretty solid throughout, of course there have been like a couple of downs and differences in opinion, but especially recently we've been really, really close and talking every day, but where the problem comes in is her new relationship. Her partner is very controlling and pretty manipulative from what I hear, she tries to control everything about this girl, like she follows who she blocks.  \n\nan instance I have been recently made aware of is that the partner told my friend to block one of her friends because She suspected the guy liked her. He's gay by the way he doesn't like women so that just wouldn't work/ wouldn't be possible just for no reason just like on the basis of the partner not liking him, which I guess is fine but really rather weird. And recently, I really wish that I never said it was ok for my friend to let her talk about this relationship to me because in my wanting to be there for her she became far too dependent on me and that was just really draining. She practically used me as a therapist And basically every single day she would call me crying about a new thing her girlfriend said or did to her, and it was very tiring because when she would ask for my advice, she just would not listen and wouldn't follow it and when I didn't want to give any input or advice, she would ask why I was being so silent and why I wasn't giving her my opinion.   \n\nIt was just all very, very frustrating and in all of this, her partner wanted her to block me because she didn't like me the partner just simply did not like me. and we never really had a conversation so I do think that this is because I blocked the girlfriend a couple weeks ago due to the fact that I just heard so many unsavoury things I just didn't want her on any of my social medias cause that just wasn't something that I wanted And they had a whole argument about it and I was talking her on the phone and she was telling me all of the stuff about how I'm the only person she  can confide in. I'm the only person that she trust all of this stuff. and then the next day I wake up and she texts me and she's like \"my girlfriend used my Instagram to block you. It's whatever though we can just text normally through our phone numbers\", and what really gets me here is that I tried to explain myself to her explain why it was hurtful to which she just didn't respond to, and it really just got to a point where she wouldn't respond to any of my texts, where I was just basically like telling her that it sucked that I'm always there for her and she can't even stand up for me/ Stand up to somebody who she constantly is complaining about. \n\nit just made me feel so weird because it's like why don't you care I've put so much effort in time into trying to understand you and listen to you, but you can't even do this one thing so I just decided to send her a goodbye message and block her But now I feel guilty about it because of all the stuff she said about trusting me and being the only person in her life that she can talk to, but after talking to some other people that also know her, she says the same thing to them so I don't know.",

There are just so many details I find important but hopefully the shortened version will also do justice. No real names used\n\nMe and my best friend(Hannah), both female, moved in together. We had been in the house for about 4 months when we threw a 21st birthday party for the both of us since our birthdays were just over a week apart. Everything was cool it was fun. We threw another party the next week with leftover supplies, it was a bit smaller, last minute party but it was just as fun. But my hangover was so much worse the second time around. Very short version, Hannah and my brother(David) had sex after I went to bed that night. David had a girlfriend(Mary), so he did cheat. I was mad at both of them. I was even mad at Mary for forgiving David in what felt like 15 minutes.\n\nI went to my parents house to get out and deal with the hangover. I talked to my mom, and she was helping me with my options which included me moving back in with her. Now I never needed to move out. I love my parents. Have a great relationship with them. I was staying there while working part time and going to college, saving my money. It was Hannah who desperately wanted to move out and get away from her mother. Get some independence. I didn't mind moving out and also gaining some more independence. So I was a-okay with moving back in.\n\nOver the next few days I was going back, taking what could fit in the car, taking it to my moms house. It came down to the furniture was just about the only thing left in the house. When I tried to go get it, the locks were already changed and it had to take the police being there to get the last of my stuff out of the house. Later that night she sent some very hateful texts to my family. Very vulgar texts to Mary about what happened between Hannah and David that night, name calling Mary. Just being outright rude. Was very rude to my mother. Called me a bad friend and tried to insinuate i cheated on my boyfriend by dancing with a guy at the party. Which it wasn't even like I was grinding on the dude. It was dancing. It was just so hateful, for her to get the last word I guess.\n\nOver the next few months, Hannah continued to text David, even though he didn't respond, saying very vulgar things to him. Wanting to get him back in bed basically.\n\nShe never once even tried to reach out to me. Which made me realize her love for my brother was stronger than our friendship.\n\nIt wasn't until she tried to follow me on insta over 6 months after the whole thing happened. She said she still cared about me, was thinking about me and wanted to catch up. She sounded so buddy buddy like this was a casual conversation like things didn't end badly with her harrassing my family. I simply told her what happened left a bad taste in my mouth and I didn't want to be friends.\n\nOf course I have no hate in my heart for her. I don't care to hold a grudge and be hateful. I hope she does better in life and can be better to her future friends. truly. Of course, I always wished I would have said something to her, that I could have said my peace to her. But I was trying to peacefully leave her life and bit my tongue.\n\nI have been told I was overreacting for just moving out. I don't know if I should have stayed. I don't know if I was quick to judge. Or an asshole for leaving her stranded in that house alone because i truly don't know if she could afford to live there by herself.\n\nI think about it often and I don't know how to feel about the situation.",

        "text": "\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m approaching friendship in the correct way or if I truly understand what it is. For as long as I can remember I have wanted to have friends (as a normal person would). I am open to being friends with anyone and I believe I am a very kind and caring person who cares deeply about other\u2019s feelings. The last true friends I remember having were in the eight grade (I had 3). Then I switched districts for high school and things we only talk occasionally now. I had a few acquaintances but none of them were real friendships. With each \u201cfriend\u201d I had I had to act a certain way and be a different person depending on who I was with. It left me not even knowing who I was in my freshman year (I still don\u2019t really). Junior year I was at a huge school with about two thousand students, I was so alone. I really put myself out there. Talked to everyone, sat with random people, but no one was welcoming there. I was nothing but nice, so I don\u2019t know what I was doing wrong. I didn\u2019t stop trying to make friends all of junior year. I am now a senior in high school and I came to a new school this year due to moving. At the beginning of the year I tried very hard to make friends and I was so eager to at my new school. Problem was, everyone already knew each other so they had their own groups. I still tried and made one actual friend in the beginning of the year. She ended up ditching me for other people about two months in (this is the only case where I knew SHE was the problem because of how she treated me during our friendship - she was rude, belittling, and more). At the odd time I would make another friend (totalling 4 this year), but with each one I find things that really bother me, like they will make plans with someone else and cancel ours after we planned them, or completely forget they were meant to hang out with me making me feel that they don\u2019t truly value my friendship. There are far more, smaller things that I pick up on every day that I wonder if I\u2019m looking too deeply into. I know friendship requires some sort of compromise and friends fight but how much should I just bat an eye to? I don\u2019t argue with any of them or even tell them when something is bothering me because I know it will just be met with \u201coh you know I didn\u2019t mean to make you feel that way\u201d fakeness and it will get nowhere (I have experienced it way too many times back when I used to be sort of confrontational in middle school). And I don\u2019t want to risk the small connections I do have and have no one on my side at all even though I am alone almost all the time. So I want to know how much I should be willing to overlook when it comes to my friends, I know I can\u2019t squander my morals, but smaller things friendship-wise. It is now the end of the school year, I have come to dislike the majority of the people at my school, especially in my grade and it just doesn\u2019t seem right. I feel that most people I know have wronged me in some way and about 80% of the people I know at my school I dislike. It seems too high, it has never been this high at any of my other schools, so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m right in feeling this way or if it is the result of some sort of mental health thing I\u2019m going through. I stopped trying to make friends months ago, I knew there was no use. We are now in the final days of school and all of the grads are softening up a little and getting emotional (not me though, I can\u2019t wait to get out of here). It\u2019s making me wonder whether I should have overlooked some of the smaller things and been more sociable. But, most times I did make a friend this year, I ended up regretting even spending any time with them. And it seems weird as someone who wants friends so badly, cherishes friendship so much, and will be friends with anyone who wants to be with me. I have heard that if something keeps repeating in your life, you\u2019re the problem, but I really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong. I\u2019m caring to everyone I meet, and I try not to be overbearing because I know that pushes people away too. I worry that I won\u2019t have any friends in university, I can feel it in my heart it will go the same way as high school, I mean it\u2019s the same people going. I\u2019ll be pretty far away but people my age are all the same across the country, I\u2019ve already moved all over it and seen. \n\nMy direct question, since the rules say I need one, is: how many frustrating/immoral things should I look over when it comes to friendship?\n\nI know that when you love someone you won\u2019t care what they do, like I will love my family unconditionally no matter what they do. But I feel with friendship it\u2019s different, like it would be foolish of me to stay with someone who doesn\u2019t cherish me. I especially don\u2019t want to be friends with someone who doesn\u2019t like me or even want to be my friend. I look at other girls my age and a lot of these friends seem to hate each other or they are always fighting, why are they still friends? What do they like about each other? But there are other ones whose friendships seem great, that\u2019s what I want.",

        "text": "I\u2019ve been friends with someone for about 8 years. We\u2019re not messaging every day, but we\u2019ve always stayed in good contact. A few weeks ago, everything seemed normal \u2014 we talked, shared updates, and made some plans.\n\nSince then, he\u2019s gone completely silent. He didn\u2019t show up for something he had offered to help with, and didn\u2019t respond when I followed up. I\u2019ve sent a few messages, tried reaching out through casual ways we normally interact, and even called \u2014 but no response at all.\n\nThe last thing I heard from him was a birthday message, which I responded to warmly. After that, nothing. There was no argument, no tension, no clear reason for this sudden silence.\n\nI know he\u2019s been seen by others recently, and I think he\u2019s still in contact with people we both know. So it\u2019s not like he\u2019s completely off the radar \u2014 but for some reason, he\u2019s just cut off contact with me.\n\nAt this point, I genuinely have no idea what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m overthinking everything \u2014 wondering if I did something wrong, if something happened, or if he\u2019s going through something he hasn\u2019t shared. I\u2019ve tried giving space, but the silence is eating at me. I\u2019m now considering going to his place in person, just to see if he\u2019s okay.\n\nHas anyone experienced something like this? How did you deal with it?",

Although one day he called me out the blue asking to goto the gym and I couldn\u2019t. We then planned for the next day. Next day came along and he then asked me for a ride to the gym. That\u2019s when he told me he totaled his car. It then had me thinking if he just wants to hang out so I can give him rides. I didn\u2019t think to much about it. But as time went along. It was almost everyday I\u2019m picking him up and taking him to the gym wit me. Then next thing you know I\u2019m driving him to work which is about 20 min out of my way. He always takes rips of my pen, leaves trash in the car, has me stop for him at other places. And would ask me to goto the dispensary and he would always be a few bucks short. Basically try to control the car and acts pretty immature for an almost 30 year old. Bro even lied about his life kinda. He said he was gonna flip a house and ends up just living in it and is going to for the next 10 years lol. It\u2019s just been very draining on my end and I\u2019m not sure if I really enjoy this. He works at a pizza shop which nothing wrong with but I\u2019m not sure how he makes money to live while living in a whole ass house while working at a pizza shop. We\u2019ve gone to the bar a few times. And it seems alright but the vibe doesn\u2019t always seem to be hitting for me. Does this sound like he is just using me for rides? Does he sound like a bad friend? Should I just cut it off? ",

The biggest thing bugging me for 5 years now is that I don't have good friends and I really just wanna hangout with them and have fun together while also being there for eachother. But every person I met in school are either more wilder and do stuff I don't wanna get involved in or just people that are really judgy and can't even breath around them bc it's 'weird' or 'too much'. \n\nI love expressing myself and being funny and out of pocket when I am comfortable, but with people like that I just don't even do anything bc they will just put me down and I feel like I am a bad and weird person. I like art things like drawing or crafting, I love being outside, and I love a good time with people. I can't explain why but I crave fun and good memories with friends so much especially that I am not enjoying life and I am more and more closer to becoming an adult and it feels so depressing knowing I didn't enjoy life and I know friends are not the key to enjoying life but it feels like it is.\n\nMaybe I should stop focusing on finding my people but I can't stop thinking about it whenever I see everyone having their friends and seeing them be there for eachother. I tried finding out what I like, who am I as a person and also finding goals, but I still feel like something is missing and it annoys me so much. I don't want to wait until adulthood to find my people either :(\n\n**My pinterest is chuwiv and I have a board that has some friend stuff in it and that's what I want in a friendship basically so check it out if you would like \ud83d\udc95 I will gladly answer any questions bc I just really want to get over with this confusion and start a new chapter, I would do anything to find the solution and move on** \ud83d\udc97",

        "text": "A little over a year ago, I let my roommates know I was moving out of our apartment in Seattle because of an ongoing leak in our living room that our landlord kept neglecting. I told them I\u2019d give them a large notice period for when I\u2019d move out and they said they\u2019d all split the rent for my portion no problem and convert my room (the largest room in the apartment) as an office for everyone.\n\nLong story short, when the time came for me to move out, they essentially said that I never gave them a notice period despite telling all of them multiple times and demanded I pay rent for the next month for the inconvenience. I told them I gave notice and I will not be paying rent and that I had already set up a moving company to move my belongings out + ship my car a few hours away to the new place I was moving to. They said that\u2019s \u201cnot what the landlord told us\u201d and proceeded to say a lot of mean things to me over text in a group chat (4 against 1) - cursing me out, calling me condescending, and eventually one of them formally ending our friendship over text saying he\u2019ll never talk to me again. They completely gaslit me. \n\nIt\u2019s important to note that during this time I had gotten pretty sick (probably due to mold from the leak in the living room). One of the roommates mother\u2019s (who is a doctor) was helping me out at the time because I wasn\u2019t from Seattle, as my primary was in Albuquerque. After trying everything to get me better she wanted me to go into talk therapy and to see a psychologist, basically suggesting that I was crazy and it was all in my head. Months later, I got diagnosed with a nervous system issue + connective tissue issue (and potentially autoimmune). This mother and my roommate clearly thought I was mentally unstable and I am certain that this roommate convinced my roommates and is going around telling my other friends in Seattle that I\u2019m crazy. I\u2019ve noticed a handful of friends in their immediate friend group unfollowed me on social media.\n\nI was in a vulnerable position at the time so I ended up reaching out to all of them to apologize (which I never should have) and they said they disagree with me but that they\u2019ll be friends again. When I lived there, I even gave them all of my furniture that I bought for them because I felt bad that they didn\u2019t have a dining table, good silverware, etc. and nobody wanted to pay for it. They never expressed gratitude. To this day, I know that this group is still going around telling our mutual friends that I am mentally ill and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I feel terrible reuniting this friendship and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen the next time I see them again, especially knowing that they are talking behind my back.\n\nHow should I approach this situation? I can\u2019t  completely ignore them, otherwise things will get worse. It\u2019s a bad situation because of how many mutual friends we have and how they\u2019ve clearly influenced others opinions of me based on lies",

        "text": "So my best friend (ex now I guess?) of almost 10 years and I went on a Europe trip this past April (2025). I thought it was a great time. But after coming back from the trip I\u2019ve been ghosted with no communication for the last month and a half. I just don\u2019t understand why?\n\nSome background to us is she and I met in college freshman year of 2015, we became super close and even after moving away from one another to different states after college in 2019, we still stayed close. We had always talked about going on a trip abroad. Had even had one planned for summer of 2020 but sadly never got to go on that one. But we finally made the plans last year to go this past April! From the span of living in different states for 5ish years of our friendship multiple trips were taken back and forth to see one another and it was one of those friendships where we might not talk for a couple weeks of busy but was always so easy to catch up when we did. We had been there for one another through a lot. Relationships, move, both of us getting our masters, just a lot of life stuff. She and I both even kinda bonded over having issues with anxiety. \nThis past year I was diagnoses with a few new mental disorders and she was supportive and like understanding and had no problems with that as I had been the same with her when she had gone through things. Leading up to this trip I had a couple big life events happen and she asked if mentally I could handle this trip? I said yes. My budget became tighter but mentally I thought I would be fine! (Which I was!) \nWe hadn\u2019t had a ton of time to catch up before the trip, again life crap between the both of us. She had started a new relationship which seemed to be moving pretty fast but I was always supportive and happy for her. I figured she was busy getting to know and spend time with this guy, especially after months previous coming off a hard breakup. When we got together the first day or two of the trip everything seemed amazing! But as the days went on she kinda retreated from talking to me or wanting to spend time with me, there were many moments where I would go eat by myself or do activities by myself because she didn\u2019t feel good or wanted to talk with her boyfriend when we did have more downtime from planned excursions. At the time didn\u2019t raise any concern as I don\u2019t mind doing my own thing but as time when on it really felt like I came on this vacation by myself. When we headed back for the airport to go back to the US we barely talked and when I made an off hand comment of \u201coh sad this flight we don\u2019t get to sit together\u201d she kinda sneered and pretty much said not to make it a big deal. I was not trying too, sometimes I just speak my thoughts because even in the past she never seemed to mind. This flight was the only flight we had together into the states and then from there we seperated since we lived in different states. When I got off the plane I figured she would be waiting to at least say goodbye. But she wasn\u2019t. I waved it off in my head as I had a tight connection and I just messaged her saying I was sorry I didn\u2019t get to say goodbye but that to me know when she landed safely and I would do the same. I got no response even after I made it home and let her know. I was hurt a little but let it go for a couple days as I know coming back from a trip can be tiring, I messaged her again to check in about a week later with no response. I waited another week but at this point I just didn\u2019t understand and with my anxiety getting higher I sent her one last message saying my feelings expressing that I was hurt and just wanted to understand with no response. After 10 years this is how it ends? I\u2019m not sure what to do if there even is anything? It just feels odd, ",

        "text": "TW-mentions of SA, Sucide, drinking\n\nSo basically I am a teenage girl and my best-friend who I'm gonna call AS came over for a sleepover for my birthday. We were in my bathroom hanging out while we were on a face time call with two of our friends. My now EX bf and our bestfriend ZJ. Well she was 'agruing' with my ex bf and she said \"I'm gonna kiss your gf.\" And I didn't think anything about it. I just thought she was joking until she grabbed me and I froze. She kissed me, didn't ask or anything and then she pinned me to the wall and kissed me again. I was scared. when I got her off I was shaking and scared my bf would dump me. (She also had a bf) and when she fell asleep I started thinking abt another time. \n\nSo apparently I got 'drunk' at school once and we made out. I have no memories of this event idk what she could have done to me. After this incident I started dating my bsf ZJ. After a week I realized I wasn't ready. I couldn't be touched without feeling disgusted with myself. So I told him I wasn't ready. He dropped me after 2 years of friendship and he's her bsf now. This girl is manipulating him and going to hurt him. He has to much of a kind heart. She tried to get me to KMS at some point. I'm scared bc I still love and care for that boy and the fact after our friend EV faked being raped, having cancer and other he stayed her friend he stayed friend with my bsf KL and with all the BS AS has done he is still friends with her. Even tho he hated her the most but he leaves me? I'm confused and hurt and scared for me for him. She will be completely alone with him since they will only talk to eachother after 6/14. \n\nOne of the things she did was, I had a dead bsf who committed b4 7th grade started for me. She said she was \u2018possessed\u2019 by my dead mother figure/bestfriend. Her name was Neya, and i probably would have believed her to. If she hadn\u2019t called me cupcake. My mother figured called me Kady. She said as my mother figure I was replacing her with AS and I had to hold back tears and she said that AS was gonna KHS bc of a boy named C. And it was my job as a child to stop it and if I didn\u2019t everything would fall apart. She knew if she left and my father figure V left i probably die myself. \n\nShe also lied about Age regression very obviously and I caught on it very quickly. She is an awful person and she scares me. But no one will take anything she\u2019s done to me or anyone seriously anymore. \n\nI can\u2019t even tell my parents, when I told them about me being bisexual or stuff my ex bestfriend did or anything traumatic in my life they call me a liar, scream, guilt trip. And I don\u2019t want to be kicked out of my house. \n\nI need help and idk how to ask for it. Does anyone have any advice how I can protect myself and my friends?",

        "post-author": "Dragonblaze47",
        "text": "Hi\n\nSo I was gonna do this through the \"Friendship\" community. But couldn't due to my karma/rep on reddit being low. \n\nSo why am I writing about this? As obviously in the title, its about how I grew up and making friends. \n\nDuring my young days, from 4-11, as anyone would i was a shy boy, but wasn't really afraid to make friends. A few of my first closest friends were girls and a guy. \n\nSecondary school, for Americans its High School or in a sense \"middle school\". Reality sorta hit at age 11. Friends I thought were friends, they weren't friends, everyone switched up, my mental ability, my maturity grew extremely fast as a young boy. I became non expressive, more quiet, non trustworthy of friends. Though thankfully some people I knew that did not switch up were still friends with me, one in particular introduced me to another boy, 2 years in. This was year 9 and we hung out since then so its been 11 years since I known this guy, he is a very honest guy that very much appreciate, while others weren't willing to say it, he would and i was thankful for that. \n\nIt took me 2 years in secondary school to find my own group, I realised very early on I don't get along with this people, most of them were all about dating, girls, sports, talking about dumb shit the typical \"jock\" type behavior. \n\nI remember everyone questioned who I was hanging out with cause the Asians stuck with Asians, the black stuck with black, the white stuck with white. They'd get together often and spend time together from time to time.\n\nMyself, I never really preferred sticking to a certain group, didn't prefer sticking to my own culture cause I found people in my culture and of my age to be cringe, to be weird, like i'm reading the same book, we all grew up more or less the same. Do I hate my own culture? No, I'm not denying what I really am. I just find my own people cringey and they'd always take the piss. Ego is a huge thing too in culture. Myself i'm Asian, Bengali descent. \n\nI never really liked how my culture was, most always tried to one up each other, insult each other and I have a certain name which I will never reveal that is literally in Indian song and every brown person knows how big bollywood is in British South Asian households. They'd take the piss out of my name by singing that song. Ofc I told them to stfu. \n\nEven with my own friend group, we didn't hang every day, it was like this, 5/5 days, or some weeks it was like 3/5-4/5. My group consisted of Somali, Afghanistani, Bengali (me), Hungarian, occasionally white. \n\nCollege came around, didn't really need to introduce myself as everyone talked to me, knew some individuals that knew my siblings that knew me and it became there, I sorta became a meme with 2 guys, it was through Overwatch since I was a Genji main, they proceed to call me Genji main for 3 years straight. \n\nI went to University, made no friends in my 4 years there and I kinda regret it. I just went to class and dipped. \n\nOverall what I wanted to mention is, that I kinda wanna make friends now, like I wanna make friends with East Asians, I literally had none in my year. Ofc with my own people, I made friends with a lot of people of different cultures, black, whites, Hungary, Afghan, Somali, basically everyone but the continent of Asia excluding Afghan since I have some friends there already. \n\nI never made friends with Asians and thats a problem to me. Ofc its my fault in that sense, cause I didn't make an effort, but am I gonna blame anything? Nah, besides from my exposure. Funny enough there are not enough or at all East Asians that i could meet. I'm literally exposed to every other culture but them.\n\nBut to the people from the continent of Asia, whether your East or South. Hit me up, please, I just wanna be friends. I don't mind if you're not british but preferably I would preferably if you were. I will try to join communities too. \n\nWhat's your lots advice on this?",

        "text": "I've never tried this before so sorry if I don't make sense.\nI don't know why but my friendships always just seem to end with me on my own. I give it my all, I'm basically always available when people need me, I truly care about them and do anything I can for them but in the end I'm always left behind. An example of this is I've asked friends to hang out quite a few times but they never make time for me but then I find out they've been doing stuff with other people in our same group. When I ended up loosing it on them for not giving a crap about me I just get told that that I'm blaming everyone else and having a pity party yet I haven't even done anything. They say that they still like me and it's nobody fault blah blah but I made the effort, I tried. But their words just seem so hollow because they've made no effort for me.\n\nAll I wanted was to spend time with them, all I want is to feel wanted and my feelings heard and understood. I just wanted friends who care as much as I do but no matter how much I care I end up thrown away in the end and I just don't understand.\n\nThere is a part of me that does wonder if its just the depression and anxiety talking but I've had no proof to prove it wrong but lots to prove it right\n\nSorry this became a bit of a rant but this pain is getting too much for me so maybe internet strangers might have some insight. Desperate times and all that",

I try to make new friends but when I hangout with them it just doesn\u2019t feel right. I have to force my laugh and when I\u2019m around them I just think about how much more fun I\u2019d be having with my best friend and how much I\u2019d rather be spending time with him. Like I feel like I\u2019m wasting my time hanging out with other friends. Does anyone else feel this way? I see so many people in friend groups or having a new best friend every year and I always wonder how they feel so comfortable and how it\u2019s so easy to find someone who completes them. I\u2019ve blown through so many friends and no one compares to my best friend. The first time me and my best friend hung out we just instantly clicked, like immediately I knew he was my best friend and he was gonna be in my life a long time. But the first time I hangout with someone else I feel uncomfortable and I get a raging headache and I don\u2019t feel a click at all. Anyone else experience this? Did you ever find someone?",

        "text": "So I (F 29 )moved to different country , I am a little anti social and it\u2019s hard for me to form a deep friendship as i am not a fan of casual friendships, I prefer a close knit group of friends , unfortunately I had to leave my old friend group because of long distance and job and other priorities\u2026we gradually lost touch. So I am in new place where I had little to no social life , it didn\u2019t bother me at first because I thought eventually I would find my kind of people . So I meet  this guy who was pretty nice , we live in same building and are from same country, after few weeks he introduced me to his larger circle of friends , things are all good and well , all of them treat me nice, whenever I visit. I don\u2019t visit to often because as I said, I am a little antisocial and I put my carrier first . But I meet this guy often as we live in same building and he is good to me and fun to hang out with and even helps whenever I ask and vice versa . But I started noticing something for a while , because we are hanging out a lot more , when we are in group setting he pretends we are not that close and doesn\u2019t start conversation with me as he does when we are alone . Today I met him when he was with some guys from group , i don\u2019t know all of them that well , but he seems pretty uncomfortable to talk to me in front of them , I felt rather ashamed and it was frankly humiliating to see him behave like he doesn\u2019t know me . They all were talking to me / we were making fun of each other . But he behaved like completely different person . (There is nothing romantic, not at all , never have been , we are not interested in each other that way ) . But I felt very let down. I feel like I overestimated our friendship, even tho he always calls or texts first to hand out everyday . I dont know how to deal with this . Just wanted to vent out but if anyone have any advice it would be helpful. \nP.s as soon as I left , I said am sorry to join his group , even tho I was there for barely few minutes. He messaged , saying I will over thinking this and nothing happened and ask me why I am messaging him like I am mad and there is nothing to be mad about , it\u2019s just me and my overthinking. I don\u2019t know am I wrong in this , Am I the asshole ? ",

For context im black carribean my other housemate is mixed race and the person in question (let\u2019s call him Jonny) is white and went to a private school outside of London. Since Jonny moved to London and has black friend it seems he feels entitled to make comments about black people and our culture. For example he says things like \u201cyou can be my chocolate for desert\u201d. \n\nAside from his micro aggressions he can be very rude at times and self entitled. He\u2019s always trying to compete to be the loudest and cleverest person in the room. Most people have noticed this and we\u2019ve been talking behind his back about this but should one of us tell him?

If I'm being honest about this, I (American) will regularly see guys make comments like this to each other in a joking way and only with their closest friends. \n\nIn the US in general, saying something about being chocolate to a person who is black, isn't really looked at as racist or any microagressjon stuff, I think solely because the person saying it would be intending it in a positive manner. \n\nI hear many women and men (of all races) say this almost as a term of endearment over here. \n\nThen when you have a straight man saying it to another straight man, it typically is when they are good friends and making joking around like that with each other. Not sure about other countries but in the states, men typically bond by giving each other shit and being competitive. It sounds like your London guy would fit in well over here.\n\nIf the loudness, trying to be the most clever etc isn't part of that dynamic, then I would be willing to bet he is doing it out of insecurity. People like that need constant reassurance they are liked etc but by doing what they're doing, they actually are creating their own nightmare situation. Sure it's hard to deal with someone who always tries to be the smartest; funniest, etc or someone that one's ups you on everything, but I've found it always helps to keep in mind that insecurity thing. When you realize that's why they're doing it, it's a lot easier to handle and even like the person.",

If they don't reciprocate getting to know you, who knows what their intentions are for being \"friends\" with you. \n\nI recently had to end this type of acquaintance-ship with someone who did not reciprocate the level of friendship I was providing. Her response to me ending it made it clear that she was using me. I had a heart attack a few months ago and am taking it easier now. Part of the reason why I ended the interactions with her is because she kept crossing my boundaries and that would stress me out. I would start to breathe heavily with anxiety when I interacted with her. \n\nSorry for the long response! You deserve to have people in your friendship circle who make you feel seen.",

However, there\u2019s this one girl who he was friends with (note: he\u2019s no longer friends with her). And she recently said something to me that made my stomach churn a little. Her and other guy friend had met up with my boyfriend and there was some weird drama going on between her and the other guy at the time, which my boyfriend tirelessly played messenger bird for. After that hangout, he didn\u2019t talk to either friend anymore because he was exhausted with their issues. \n\nShe and I recently texted each other and for context, in the past, she\u2019s made me nervous about being close to my boyfriend because she always seemed to want to talk to him. She only has guy friends (and while that\u2019s not a bad thing, she has dated at least half of them), and says that all the girls she used to be friends with hate her now. For some reason, she always seemed to want to hangout with my boyfriend one on one but he never wanted to. More recently, she told me how her and my boyfriend aren\u2019t friends anymore and then joked, \u201cAt least you don\u2019t have to be paranoid about me going after him.\u201d And its been a few weeks since that, and i asked my boyfriend to block her (which he did without complaint).

She had promised her help and support. When I texted her today to confirm and ask when we would see. I was surprised that she had another hangout both day, I.e Friday and Saturday. Mind you the deadline was on Saturday, something she was aware of at the time of planning helping me.\n\nI do have problems with my classmates, and I have told her why in details and that I don\u2019t slide disrespect. I am honestly saddened by that since I would never do such thing. I respect words and she has given me hers.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I reasonable?

None of them have ever had a job that works towards a career; some of them have never had a job period. They have never been on payroll. Never had financial responsibility (paying rent, phone bill, car insurance etc). My best friend is in their third year of city college but they\u2019re not working towards anything, just taking random classes\u2026 they may be doing a fourth year there. \n\nI\u2019m not saying I have my life together, I live with my parents too. But, I have had an office job for over two years, own my car and phone (and pay for anything involving them), pay for my own food, and pay rent. I have finished city college and a certificate through Berkeley. I have aspirations and am working towards my goal career.\n\nThis sounds so conceited and elitist but I enjoy doing nice things occasionally and they will rarely join. When we do attend nice events I am honestly embarrassed by how they act and dress\u2026 zero class. They hit their vapes in restaurants, constantly swear, and steal. They\u2019ve also been arrested multiple times for being drunk in public and disturbing public peace (and then blame everyone but themselves). \n\nI feel like I am growing up and they\u2019re not but I feel so guilty for feeling this way. \n\nI also don\u2019t feel comfortable going to my best friends house because of how filthy it is. I am not judging how they live because it\u2019s not necessarily their fault and I feel terrible. But it gets to a point and it makes me mad that their dad is doing nothing to help their situation. There is mold and rotten food everywhere, I\u2019m certain there is asbestos, and the house reeks so badly of cat litter it makes all my clothes and hair smell just from stepping in there. You can\u2019t see the floor in their room and there\u2019s piles of clothes and trash everywhere. I feel so bad but I don\u2019t have the best health so their home is not a safe place for me. I have been avoiding going over there but eventually they will ask why I keep avoiding their house.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to find new friends. I love them and feel like a god awful friend but am also so fed up and ready to move on. I thought things would get better after graduating high school but it\u2019s been three years and I\u2019m the only one who has made an effort to enter adulthood. \n\nHELP!",

I\u2019m 18f and I have 2 friends one 20f and the other 21f, well we recently rekindled our friendship after falling out back in 2024, a little backstory  I lived with them as one of their 3 other roommates, well every night I would walk on eggshells around these two girls mostly 20f, she is somewhat dramatic and sensitive andddd bossy, 21f is her girlfriend so she wouldn\u2019t disagree with her, I would randomly every night get a long paragraph as they pointed out the things I did wrong like I didn\u2019t clean the kitchen before I went to work, mind you I worked night shift and during the day I would drive them around in my car to run errands and barley get any sleep for the night ahead of me, so they would get mad saying I wasn\u2019t being a good roommate, i had gone to work multiple times with no sleep and ended up falling asleep while driving, putting my life at risk to appease them, I had a schedule to where I would deep clean the apartment every Tuesday when I brought it up to them that, it\u2019s what I normally do, they said no you shouldn\u2019t have a set day you should clean everyday, that\u2019s fair there are a lot of people that live there, but to send me a paragraph saying I was wrong about it is kinda uncalled for, I would clean the apartment and by time I woke up they would have friends over partying as I went out to work and would come back to a mess I had to clean, anyways after taking all of their hateful comments over that time I finally had enough and left ! They harassed me after I left calling my work so I could get on the phone with them, they would call my phone on different number and even one time they came to my new apartment (which I found this out the other day because they were joking about it ) I\u2019m all about forgiving people and I rarely get mad, but I have continued to get paragraphs from them at night basically ganging up on me making me feel crazy, I offered to take my car so we could drive to the pool about 15 ish minutes away, once they got in my car they were quiet secretly texting each other in the back and giggling, I ignored it, well that night after I had dropped them off they sent me a long text basically saying my car was horrible and it was dirty which shocked me considering I clean my car regularly, I know the day they got in my car I had a sonic tray in the back that I tossed into my trunk and a few clothes in the floor board, well they claimed my car was so dirty it made one of them itch because they are a germaphobe or something, not really a germaphobe but you get what I\u2019m saying, it kinda hurt my feelings to know that it\u2019s what they were thinking, I\u2019m a CNA with a full time job and patient that takes up most of my time so sometimes I eat in my car, I also no longer have the time to hangout with them if not for work I hate being away from my boyfriend and won\u2019t go anywhere without him, call it what you want but he is my comfort person and I know he will always protect me through thick and thin, well they finally got to meet him after we rekindled, the first time I had come over they told me I couldn\u2019t bring him so I said okay and didn\u2019t, they said the next time I came he could come, so I brought him and we all drank and got along and swam together, he even comes the next time and we all get along ! \nMe and him are a package deal I assumed after they met him things would be good because I know my boyfriend wouldn\u2019t go anywhere without me either, if his friends told him not to bring me he wouldn\u2019t go, so that\u2019s the same energy I am bringing, the two girls are always together as well since they are dating, well o was invited to their birthday party where they would be drinking and partying all night, I don\u2019t do that type of stuff and I don\u2019t stay out all night, I work 7 days a week, well I asked \u201chey well is my boyfriend invited too?\u201d They said no and that they didn\u2019t know him for him to come which blew me considering they had all said that we were all friends ? I know if I say anything about it a whole fight will break out and which I don\u2019t care I just wish they would bump it down a few levels. Am I in the wrong? ",

When I spoke to my friend about it with concern, they reassured me that the group was just \"misunderstood\". Now I'm seeing a lot of negative posts about this group and it includes my friend, which is concerning in itself, but other friends of our group (who are uncomfortable with the bad influence of person A's new friends) are getting harrassed for associating with person A... There are also videos and screenshots of person A engaging in bad activity with this new group. Person A is still pretty young and impressionable, so this worried me even more!!\n\nHow do I handle something like this? I want the best for person A, and I'd be distraught if cutting them off was the only option... My friends are stressing over it too, we intend to talk to them about it but I'd hate to \"force\" person A to do something seeing as we aren't their parents. Any advice?? Thank you! ",

        "text": "Some backstory Mixed in for context\n\nSo I (M/33) met this girl (F/22) about 7 Months ago. We chatted and ended up becoming best friends over the course of a couple of months. I have no feelings for her nor does she any for me, it started out just both of us venting and turned I to us talking almost 24/7. It was weird but we both just enjoyed talking to someone who didn't have ulterior motives. She knows I have anxiety so I do struggle with not being overwhelming at times. However she's always made a point to say good morning everyday and even if she is busy makes a point to at least chat a few minutes whenever she can.\n\nThis leads to what's going on now. She went to visit family recently so I knew she would not be as active texting as normal. The first couple of days she still made a point to say Good Morning and even check in occasionally just to see how I was. She even made a point to call me just to talk a few. Since that phone call i feel she has been messaging less and less, and 2 days ago she just kinda quit texting me. \n\nI was still texting her as I normally would just thinking shes busy and will respond before she goes to bed or when she wakes up, but nothing. \n\nI have a lot of respect for her and do seriously care about her, she balances being a single mom, work, more work, being best friends with someone my level of anxiety, and what couple of things she can do that she enjoys. She has always been pretty good at this.\n\nI dont believe she is ghosting me (as weird as it sounds she's not one to ghost, she would definitely tell anyone she cuts off why she cut them off). I also know that I message more than the average person, even if she dont respond but I have cut back greatly in the past couple of days thinking maybe I was just overwhelming. \n\nShe's still active on socials, she posts pictures of her trip occasionally. Im not blocked on anything and she still shares her location with me.\n\nIDK Maybe im overwhelming, maybe im over thinking things, maybe when she gets home things will go back to normal?\n\nI wish i could describe our friendship better to convey why this all is bugging me without it sounding weird. Like think of 2 people dating with no romance or sex. Thats what we are. \n\nI just really miss my bestie, my go to, like the one person who gets me...\n\nI dont know if this is a rant, or me asking for advice.\n\nThis will be the first day I dont text her so im sad but maybe space will help.\n\nThanks for listening to me Reddit, I appreciate any honest feedback!!!!\n\nEdit: I am Very aware that she's probably just not texting because she's enjoying time with her family. Im just an anxious person that needed to rant. Much Love!",

She would confide stuff with me and I hate to admit it I was a bit flippant with her. I wanted to continue being friends with her but I was easily influenced by my friends at the time. I regret it so much. A few years ago she had asked me if I wanted to meet up (which I ignored). I was thinking of reaching out to her but I noticed she deleted all her social media and the number I have of hers is 8+ years old. I was thinking of messaging her brother and asking him to pass along a message but I'm unsure if this would be weird (I do know her brother and we were in the same class in high school)",

        "text": "I (F18) recently cut off a friend of mine after being forgotten and left behind. \n\nContext: I've been bestfriends with this girl since highschool. Before stepping into senior high school we both go out of our toxic friend group and went to the same school and met a new cof. Everything went fine for most of our shs days but a few months before the graduation, a guy confessed to her, which shouldn't be a problem right? But one of our friends in our cof has been crushing on this guy for almost throughout highschool. But when our friends asked if the girl would be fine having a girlfriend with one of our friends (my bestfriend) the girl told us that she would be fine since the girl was already rejected by this guy. So, that was her green light yet, after all of my advice to my best friend went on deaf ears to tell our friend that she has already been talking to her crush. Which ended up us being cut off from that friend group, I was given the choice to stay with them or stay with my best friend so I chose to stay with her. But after this incident, she started having a new cof, which I wasn't mad about but slowly but surely we started to drift apart and I've noticed she wasn't focusing on her studies anymore, started to develop hqbits with them and she didn't even apply to any of the colleges. I've already noticed it, so I tried talking to her about the matter and hopefully resolve it, but it was all useless. She would only chat me or talk to me when she needed me. So I resulted spending time with my bf instead, which made the gap even bigger. Then the final straw for me was when she left me alone for an hour to go with her new cof while I waited for her to come back. \n\nI've been thinking a lot about this and I just wanted to vent out. (I've also asked and apologized to her if I had any lapses as a friend.) yet, still I can't seem to let her go despite her moving on without me. So how do I deal with this?",
