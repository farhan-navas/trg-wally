        "text": "I\u2019m in Singapore for the first time, SEA for that matter, and I\u2019m sweating like crazy. When I\u2019m home I usually take one shower in the morning and sometimes a second one before bed if I got a bit too sweaty. \n\nBut here, I\u2019ve been taking at least three showers a day. First one in the morning, second after being out and about during the day and the third one after going out in the evening. \n\nObviously with jobs in the weekday, three is probably not the answer but during the weekends, do you guys take multiple showers?

They barely leave the house for reasons that aren't related to going to work or meeting other members of the family (this one isn't that often also). My dad had a stroke recently, so they've started going on evening walks as well to keep active, else they'd spend the whole day either at work or sat in front of the TV.\n\nThey don't seem to have friends who aren't family members or colleagues, and they don't have any hobbies. If it wasn't for mother's day or Chinese new year, I think they'd be happy to spend every weekend at home in front of the TV, not talking.\n\nIs this normal? I'm a little concerned that my mum is such a workaholic that when it comes time for her to retire, she'll enter the post-work depression that many retirees face because she literally has no interests outside of work.\n\nBut I'm also worried because is this just how people of previous generations behave, or are they depressed? There's literally nothing for us to talk about other than food \u2014 is that normal?",

Unless your parents had been physically active in their early years, when you reach your 50s, it can feel tired after work with no energy for hobbies.  And if when they were younger and focus was on making ends meet or making money, then it's difficult to expect them to suddenly have hobbies, be active etc.\n\nAs for friends, as you grow older, it gets more difficult to know new friends unless you are active in clubs with your hobbies etc.  Keeping in touch with friends also takes energy and commitment, especially when everyone settles down and have family.  Then it becomesorw difficult to meet, and in a year if you try to arrange say 4 meetups and your friends keep cannot make it, it takes faith and commitment to keep trying.\n\nYou can play your part to involve them or slowly intro them to some activity groups etc.",

There are simply too many regulations out there.\n\nTake mountain biking for example. The handle bar is usually too long/wide to use on park connectors and roads (there are LTA regulations on this). In order to travel to the mountain biking trail, u need to own a car. Because no way in hell the average grab/taxi car is going to have a bike mount. Using a shorter handle bar will reduce your control over the bike which can be extremely dangerous on mountain biking paths. I myself am not a mountain biker, but these are just some of the struggles I\u2019ve heard.\n\nThere are many other regulations that almost make it seem like the govt is forcing people out of certain hobbies that are the norm in many other countries. If the govt were to actually look into some of the issues faced by various hobbyist groups, they will actually realise that there are many better ways to regulate and promote these actually healthy hobbies. Unfortunately, as someone who has tried to push for such a change for a particular hobby, it just ended up with the different authorities throwing the issue around to one another. From what I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s the same situation for many other issues besides just regulations of hobbies. It\u2019s only until the media catches attention of it when the govt starts doing something",

I feel like I\u2019m not where I want to be, but we each have our own race, and shouldn\u2019t compare (easier said than done).\n\nWas diagnosed with a slip disc and the pain / discomfort doesn\u2019t go away fully, and the only way is to keep doing stretches and light exercises. I do walks too during lunch time during my wfh days, and stretches on my yoga mat frequently to combat the discomfort. \n\nHad a new job. Work hasn\u2019t been easy and it does eat into non working hours at times. Somehow, I don\u2019t have the same amount of energy and passion as I did for all my previous jobs. \n\nI do make plans every weekend to head out to meet friends, to keep an active lifestyle while managing my back condition. \n\nHow do you break out of such a cycle?

The only way to solve this is to keep working out and working through the pain as shared by the specialist and 2 physio therapists that I consulted.

Poor guy must have been hungry but tbh based on my experience in many countries many people just fake it in the pretext of getting money. I\u2019ve encountered people bugging me to buy roses in clarkequay etc but never something like this.\n\nIs this legit or oftentimes scams?

With mothers bringing their kids out to beg, and claim they need some money for MRT transportation. There was no 'thank you', or the common form of gratitude, and she just went on to ask for more from others, even tho i gave her enough for a trip to anywhere in singapore for her and her kids. I then waited there for 10 minutes and saw that she just kept asking and getting money.\n\nThere are plenty of articles and sharings of stories similar to mine. Do they really need the money? No doubt. Are they worth your kindness, highly doubt so. \n\nI have since then had a SOP when I see / meet this type of scene.  \n1) If a person is hungry, I buy them food. If they need transport, I buy them an MRT ticket. If they need a cab (and i have met people who asked for a cab as they feel uncomfortable), I bring the staff (of that location) to them and tell them to help.  \n2) I tell myself that if I give cash, I am just growing a bad culture of free payouts to entitled people.\n\nI think we should still help, but we shouldn't give cash.

They eventually had to find her a job so she won\u2019t go around doing that just to pass time. So that was abit strange to hear because her mom used to be a respectable teacher \ud83d\ude05",

A day or two later, I was driving through my neighbourhood and saw this exact same woman opening the gate to a landed property and stepping inside.\n\nAnother time I was eating at a restaurant in Tampines with my friends, and this guy approached us asking for money, making hand gestures and mumbling words incoherently. Each of us shook our heads and told him no. Instead of leaving, he just kept on going, so me and my friends ignored him and continued our conversation while he mumbled on. He did this for THREE WHOLE MINUTES while we talked, mumbling to himself while standing next to our table the whole time. He left eventually, but my God that was unpleasant.\n\nIn general, my rule is to never give money. If these people need food or a meal, you can buy them something to eat.

However strongly they profess this to be an integral part of their beliefs, it is **objectively regressive** if you take into account the fact that it literally compels ethnic Malays who may not identify with or want to profess Islam, to continue associating with the religion of Islam.\n\nFor Singaporean Muslims, I don't doubt their ethnocultural identity is closely tied to Islam. Singapore has no issue with that. In fact, our country goes far out of its way to preserve and support the primacy of Islam and Islamic culture in the lives of the Malay community.\n\nWhat I meant was that Singapore does not participate in the regressive practice of legally tying Singaporean Malays' identity to Islam. There is no place for such a compelled value in our system of government and secular society. Even our close neighbour Indonesia with the world's largest Muslim population, does not do that, and have taken a (relatively) more enlightened approach with pancasila.",

Yeah, I get that you\u2019re talking about state compulsion but for many Malays, Islam isn\u2019t something imposed. It\u2019s who we are, not because the government says so, but because it\u2019s part of our history, culture, and personal belief. Reducing that to \u201cregressive\u201d feels like you\u2019re dismissing the lived reality of millions of people who genuinely hold that identity.\n\nAnd look, I agree Singapore doesn\u2019t legally tie Malay identity to Islam, and that\u2019s a good thing. But we also don\u2019t need secularism to come in and \u201csave\u201d us from our own culture.

The point that you leave your gods behind is not when you denounce them, it is when you finally realise that there was nothing to denounce in the first place.I wonder when people will cast off their fears and insecurities and move on from religion.",

Then there's the Sentosa Cove people and the GCBA bunch.\n\nIn Katong and its whereabouts, I had a Singaporean family who owns an overseas Hotel chain, then an Indian Supermarket chain/Property Developer/Slave owner. In Serangoon Gardens/Bukit Timah, various people who came from old money, who mostly own businesses, some Malaysian investors and also a mix of Indonesians too who bought the house before the rules kicked in.\n\nAt Sentosa Cove, we had 5 clients, 3 of them belonged to a local food chain owner, 1 owner of a property developer from China, then there was a mysterious bunch of people who turned out to be money launderers.\n\nAt GCBA, we had a descendant of a Malaysian business conglomerate, a local Supermarket chain owner, an Indian property developer, then again another mysterious bunch of people who turned out to be money launderers.",

The nicest ones I've been to were around gallop walk and bishops gate.\n\nSecond group, you'll run through the whole gamut. Way back in the 70s/80 and even early 90s, you could still afford a terrace (inter or end unit) on a dual (even single) salary, even as a civil servant or teacher. Think my parents got our old place for 6-700k(?) back in the late 80s, and they worked for the govt (not even high flyer scholar shit, just your rando Nando person). Granted it was only an inter-terrace, but that shit costs just shy of 3m last time I checked.

And cost of living was really low, not to mention that generation didn\u2019t spend much money. Clothes got hole, ownself patch, no shopping nothing. And housing loans didn\u2019t require that sort of downpayment (lol banks loaned 100-105% in the 90s) back then.\n\nIf anyone has concerns about generational hoarding, the property tax would eat the second group alive these days so unless they ventured off into some successful business or their children are doing well enough to afford it, they usually end up selling and moving to a condo.",

Story goes the great grand dad owned a big house, then sub plot that into 6 to be given out to each of his kids. My family GP's dad did the same thing, bought each of his kids a house at Frankel, at the original land size. His brother sold off his place around a decade ago for a cool 10mill.",

Singapore sees more small businesses closing down, Hong Kong also the same. \n\nBut their university culture is completely different from ours. Hong Kong universities, before the 2019 protests, the unions actually do protect the students. \n\nMeanwhile NTU? Pui la. All my four years there, the union does jack shit. All focused on using their union membership to look good on their resume.\n\nThat being said, we're almost similar. But I would say Singapore has a \"healthier\" internet culture. Hong Kong has shit like LIKHG and Golden, both of them make SG Raw and EDMW look civilized in comparison.\n\nShanmugam and the folks at MHA (police + ISD) would have shut down LIHKG and Golden long time ago.

I always thought hker speaks english at a native level or near too but so many of them speaks with such thick accent and broken english and u can tell they struggle when they attempt to speak it. Im not saying those man in the street im saying young 20+ hkers studying in their supposedly top university HKU & the moment they know i speak canto & mandarin they beg me to speak it to them instead of using English because theyre not confident in it.\n- they speak chinese with a hk accent but def better than genz singaporeans speaking chinese\n- a lot of old buildings u will see some high rise and new condos here and there but they have a lot of old shops and buildings that wouldve been demolished in SG long ago\n-\n\nAs a hongkonger how they view SG (from asking locals i know):\n- some of them dislike Singapore because they view us as a competitor in finance hub, university rankings etc (but tbh we dont because in our opinion HK universities were never on a better rank than us) but my hk friends studying in HKU always like to bring up NUS and say how theyre ranked higher in the asian rankings at some no name site ive never heard of which nobody looks at because everyone look at qs global ranking? Some even made fun of me because i was from NUS which in their eyes are their competitors (how can we be competitors when they have never even reached our level?)\n- some dislike singapore because they feel that we are stealing investments and MNCs as they move to SG instead \n- some feel like SG is very similar to HK in terms of pace & business hub etc & SOL & size as compared to rest of asia and are indifferent\n- locals do know we are not the same from mainland chinese and even for those that dislike us is not because they look down on us (like how they view mainlanders) but rather because they feel that we are competitors and are unhappy that we are \u201cwinning\u201d them\n- so many locals tell me they feel that singaporeans can speak English at a native level and theyre envious about it because they are bad at speaking english (self labelled)\n- 8/10 of young hker i know tell me that they plan to move to SG and get a SG citizenship eventually because they have given up on HK\u2019s situation (iykyk)\n- those that visited SG even said they find singapore fun LOL and HK boring instead (so our feelings are mutual)\n- surprisingly so many of them who came to SG actually come for some NUS/NTU summer camps or just to visit the school in hopes of getting in but got rejected so they study locally in HK instead",

This caused all the flat areas (which are all near the waterfront) to be rapidly developed and occupied creating a lot of crowds. The second phase of rapid development was in the 1970s to 1990s where more of the rural flat areas were developed into towns, leaving the mountains largely as nature reserves and parks. \n\nSingapore on the other hand grew with more space because the government levelled hills for land reclamation and this created more space to build towns. \n\nIn other words, Hong Kong had to develop fast because of the influx of people in the 1950s and this caused haphazard (and organic) development around the flat areas. Singapore, on the other hand, had to develop fast in the 1970s because of independence, having to survive and build the economy and this resulted in a more controlled and 'tabula rasa-style' of development.",

The good news is i am sure there will be enough dissenters within PAP MPs themselves if such a stupid regulation is to be tabled (vs US president's executive order, which simply has to be signed off by the president alone). Thus realistically, the only drawback is when PAP tables changes that are more grey. With this supermajority, PAP changed the rules for the 2017 presidential election. Personally, i am neutral regarding such changes but the possible chance of abuse is not to be ignored. There is a also a \"self-check\" in that if they use this supermajority one too many times, the population may well vote against them in the next GE\n\n2.  Lack of ideas - i don't really see this as a problem but many do so i shall just state it here. As there is a selection process for PAP candidates, it is probable that the candidates may generally possess similar thinking and thus during their internal discussion, the outcome may be a result of \"group think\". Personally, I dont see this as a bad thing as most of the proposals from opposition MPs are merely ridiculous.

And the only way is to get more seats, do more and continue to challenge the government.\n\nIn no major democratic society has a government kept supermajority power in fair elections forevef. Even Japan where the LDP wins most elections had lost before. We need a viable alternative. The PAP can't be the right choice or perfect forever. And if we don't have a viable other choice at some point. Singapore is going to be at risk.",

                "body": "So far based on the answers I\u2019ve seen, you are getting one-sided biased answers. Allow me to give you a balanced perspective on this.\n\nThe truth is - Singapore is legitimately a democratic country with free and fair elections. You have the freedom to vote. No one is stopping you from voting opposition. Your vote is secret. No one is stopping the electoral process. Now the next question you\u2019re wondering is why does the PAP keep winning since indepedence? In short - the answer can be divided into 2 - the PAP is a symbol of stability, and the opposition (except WP) not showing that form of stability. Stability is key for a country like Singapore, as we are an import-dependent nation with only human capital to show. Foreign investment also comes to Singapore because people expects the country to be stable even as crisis develop.  \n\nThe recent two elections (GE2020 and GE2025) comes at the time where global rifts happened/are happening - COVID, and now Trump Tariffs. It could be said that the swing to the PAP this GE can be attributed to the well-done performance of COVID, and taking that, trusting them to lead them through the tariffs issue once more. \n\nThere is a valid point - without giving a chance to the opposition to try and govern Singapore, we will never really know whether Singapore will fare well under the opposition. But the problem is that except the WP, the quality of the opposition is lacking. Furthermore, the type of opposition also differs - WP is different to SDP is different to PSP and so on. So people might feel that a multi-opposition party in Singapore might cause instability due to differing mindsets. You don\u2019t have to look far at how differing mindsets work, just look across the Causeway or the Straits of Malacca.  \n\nHaving said that, personally, there is a concerning increase of those who desire change without considering much of the bigger picture the incumbent must do, and as such, online, the incumbent doesn\u2019t sound popular. But I would like to quote: Sometimes, the right thing isn\u2019t the most popular thing. \n\nOverall, the incumbent isn\u2019t free of flaws either, but for now, the bigger picture - majority of Singaporeans value stability over radical change.",

Perhaps you really don't know the history.\n\nOperation Coldstore, Operation Spectrum. Suing opposition politician JBJ & TLH to bankruptcy for libel. Threatening voters that their HDB estates would not be upgraded if they voted for the opposition. These are just a few from a long list. These are not popular bread-and-butter issues but issues about integrity, fairness and ethics, so it's not about PAP doing the \"right things\" that are not the \"most popular\".\n\nVoting for the opposition is not even about change. For some people is about reigning in PAP arrogance.\n\nOTOH, the populace is politically apathetic by design, educated to be so by design in the education system and the censorship system. The political position of the people does not exist independently of PAP influence since they have all the ministers and the control of information dissemination.

There is of course there is the merger of municipal duties with the MPs who are primarily lawmakers.\n\nUnlike many other democracies , Singapore only has representative democracy. There is no semi-direct democracy where citizens engage directly in policy-making via referendums. This results in very low political education among the citizenry.\n\nWithout a balanced Parliament, it cannot serve as check on executive power. Like how huge corporations have external audit to audit on its governance, Parliament serves as audit on executive power.\n\nA mature democratic society will swing between progressive and conservative. That is actually ok and normal. If the conservative PAP were to lose power and return to power in this manner, frankly Singapore will still remain as a prosperous nation for years (you should give the civil service credit for that), and possibly even better.  \n  \nHaving PAP in power for a long time is pretty akin for a society to stuck being like Peter Pan: the boy who never grows up, and will never experience growing pain and wisdom.",

In theory, many things might sound perfect but when you slot in human beings, that's when things start to fall apart and when you look closely at organisation theory and political theory, there is no perfect political structure.\n\nMany things that people here assume eg must have more than one party, etc is based on the assumption that democracy is perfect. But it is not. Usa political system is a shining example of the weaknesses of democracy. Hyper-partisanship where the people are a divided people and political parties care more about party interests than national interests and the interests of the citizens.\n\nSince 2020, guns have killed more children in America than any other cause. Yet, they have been unable to change the constitution to tighten gun laws. Why? Because their overly democratic political system has made it almost impossible to change the constitution and at the end of the day, political parties and politicians there serve party interests more than what is actually good for the country and the people.\n\nI'm not saying Singapore's political system is perfect. But every decision has its trade offs. With a strong party, Singapore is able to adjust to changes in the global landscape much faster. While other countries are still arguing in parliament about what to do, Singapore's government's strength has historically been quick and decisive action rooted in intelligent pragmatism. However, theoretically, the  trade off for this is that people say that there is \"no checks and balances\". But in Singapore's case, is this true?\n\nDuring the ntuc-allianz case, who was check and balancing ncm and labour mps? It wasn't wp who actually abstained from the vote. It was pap checking their own people and enacting laws so that such things can't happen again.\n\nDuring Iswaran case, again it was pap punishing their own people. Opposition had nothing to do with it. They were too busy with stupid shit like demanding the size of our reserves to be made public (economic suicide) and making a fuss over what houses ministers were renting.\n\nWhen there's a main strong party, it's the people assessing the party. There is less extreme loyalty as there are no sides to take and thus people call out the party if they dont do well and their judgment is not veiled by allegiance. China has no rival party and yet they are accountable to the people and have invested in infrastructure and their people far better than the leader of democracy, America who became powerful not because of their political system but because of war mongering and superior weaponry plus being the worlds most popular reserve currency.\n\nBut look at our recent elections, where both wp and pap supporters have spawned fanboys eager to dismiss and ignore what their chosen party has done. Of course, not all are like that but I think its crazy how pritam Singh can keep lying and people who talk like they care about pap's transparency can in the same breath excuse Singh's lies and shady actions. Hawker centre case was cos they gave the contract to a wp member's brother's cleaning company who demanded that hawkers top up more for the same quality of cleaning as the previous contractor. They ask for things that are detrimental to Sg such as revealing our reserves to the world which would make us vulnerable to speculative attacls. But still, their supporters support them like they're a football club. Its not healthy to say the least.",

For eg. If you have a group of only tall people, they will not bother to make any decisions that benefit short people simply because they don't even know or care about how short people live.\n\nThen, when there are opposing voices, they get drowned out by the group since it becomes an \"us vs them\" issue and members of the group will oppose the outsiders.

For sure it belongs to the aunty and I saw her placed it near the lift before.  However, the new neighbor is pretty fierce and claimed that anywhere outside the units is public and they can freely placed their items.\n\nMind you, if the fire gone wild, it will effectively block the escape route for my family and her family.\nI don\u2019t know if approach them will stop them from doing it, and also I\u2019m concerned how to maintain good relationship as neighbour following such approach.\nReporting directly to town council will definitely exposes me as the complaining party.\n\nIf you were me, what would you do?\n\nTLDR: neighbour burns prayers paper at our only fire escape route, what to do without ruining relationships with neighbour?\n\n\n\n",
