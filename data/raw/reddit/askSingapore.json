        "text": "Turing 23 this year, feel lost in life, never dated before,never been in a serious relationship, no friends, working in a small SME now. Socially awkward and labeled as a nerd.\n\nFeel like people around my age have it all figured out whether be it finances,relationship and adulting. Think I'm a bad decision maker. Not yet gaining independence yet, sometimes I question whether I'm stupid or not.\n\nSo young adults in Singapore in their early or mid 20s, at which age did you started to figure out all these things? Does anyone feel the same way?",

I usually avoid the popular guys and go for nerds/geeks because we have similar commons but have gaps in a few areas, so we explore, understand and learn more about each other.\n\nI also understand how you feel about being lost in life at 23, I called that phase my \u201cquarter life crisis\u201d because so many things fell apart and I had to restart from scratch.\n\nI took a step back and asked myself what are my top priorities (money, relationship, career, happiness, health) and ranked them in order of importance, then dived into each of them step by step. \n\nIn my understanding, money correlates with a lot of things. Better career, higher salary, more savings, more spending power, more happiness from being able to buy things I want. So I got better jobs to increase my income. I also went for a health checkup to be more aware of my overall health. \n\nAs for relationships, I wasn\u2019t worried as somehow, I won\u2019t be able to stay single for long. People talk about standards, but I started with none and built them through each relationship, finding out what I want and not want in my partner (e.g. should be emotionally mature and stable, must not get destructive when angry). \n\nSo if you feel lost in life, it\u2019s normal and you\u2019re definitely not alone. Take one step at a time. We\u2019ll get through it!",

With your own emotional state and feelings, prioritize yourself. Talk with them about how you're being drained by the constant negative talk. **That you are her friend, and not her personal emotional punching bag**.\n\nIf she defaults to splurting out negative talk, tell her you want her to ask you first whether or not it's okay. Set clear boundaries, yes and no, that kind of thing. \n\nIf she values you as a friend, she will take your input into account and act upon it. It won't happen instantly of course, but as long as they put in the effort sooner or later you two can still have a healthy relationship.\n\nDo not assume like others here that she's just attention seeking and whatnot. Just... try not to assume the worst in others. She's your friend right? So if you two want to keep being friends, both of you will 100% find a way through this with equal burden. \n\nOf course, if she doesn't reciprocate these requests of yours and acts completely ignorant, you can say you tried and cut it off with no regrets.",

They won\u2019t survive if they went back to their own country. There is so much backstabbing and undercutting everywhere and that they have been lulled into a state where they cannot fathom how to be backstabbing undercutting scheming people anymore. \n\nThey love love love Singapore and say we are raised with love and integrity with strong morals, we are kind - when they say us Singaporeans until so good I also feel embarrassed cos I don\u2019t feel that we are so worthy of being placed on a pedestal \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd I said there is a lot of latent hostility against foreigners, they said yes there are some but they don\u2019t really feel it, and think it\u2019s normal not to like others who were not born and raised here, and they accept and agree since they are \u201cguests here in sg\u201d\n",

Which means there is no baseline what you can do or cannot do when law do not forbid and when nobody checks. \n\nThe competition in China be it in school or workplace, I think could be at least 10 or 100 times more competitive than Singapore or Australia.

        "post-author": "TPThrowAwayAccount",
        "text": "(Asking this on my throwaway because my relatives use Reddit too, and I do not want them to find my main Reddit account via this post)\n\nI'm going to cut to the chase, and condense the story of how I even landed myself in this situation. \n\nMy mom had been acting erratically for some time, and several police calls were made by other family members and herself over the last few weeks, as her erratic behavior had gotten worse. On Thursday night, a very severe incident happened. The police was called in once again, but this time, she was detained under the \"Detention and treatment under Mental Health (Care and Treatment) act (MHCTA)\" and sent to IMH. \n\nThen came Friday. I made sure to correspond with the doctors in the morning to obtain basic information, which includes how long she would have to stay in for (they have told me it is likely she would not be let go in a short period of time as they need to monitor her for a period of time), what she is being diagnosed with (they have told me it is likely to be schizophrenia), and what medication she is put on (i have been told she has been started on Risperidone for now, with potential adjustments or change of medication depending on how she responds to Risperidone come Monday), among other things. Nonetheless, I still have heaps of questions that have come up between Friday and now, some of which I feel that IMH might not be able to answer. I also have other questions that I feel IMH might be able to answer, but I am unable to get a hold of them over the phone at the moment since it is a weekend right now, which means I have to resort to Reddit and Google.\n\nFurther context before the questions come up: My dad is out of the picture as my mom and dad had a divorce many years ago, with the custody going to my mom at the time. Dad is currently overseas for work, and is unable to return home for now. Apologies if some of my questions sound really silly, but this is the first time I am experiencing a situation where a family member has been taken away under MHCTA, so I am a very confused man right now haha!\n\n- My younger brother is still in Secondary school. Who would sign things like consent forms since both parents are MIA at the moment?\n- My younger brother's passport has expired, and he needs a passport for a potential school trip overseas. How would we go about getting a new passport for him without either parent in action? He really wants to go for this school trip, so any advice on this front would be awesome!\n- Our HDB flat currently has a mortgage under my mom's name, administered by OCBC bank. Our social worker has mentioned to us that dealing with \"private\" mortgages is more of a headache in the context of our current situation compared to HDB mortgages. How would we go about paying this mortgage on her behalf while she is in IMH? We are financially stable enough to cover the mortgage, we just need advice as to how we actually hand the money to OCBC on her behalf.\n- In future, if bills from IMH show up, would it be possible to get my mom to pay for it with her own Medisave? (I forgot to ask IMH this on Friday when corresponding, oops)\n- Mom seems to have partial access to her mobile phone (time-limited), which is confirmed by both my correspondence with IMH on Friday, and the fact she has started harassing family members begging for them to bail her out over a 30 minute window on Saturday morning on Whatsapp. One such family member she harassed on Whatsapp is my younger brother. Can I do anything about this? Could I speak to IMH to get her mobile phone confiscated entirely? (This sounds like a highly drastic measure, but no one wants to wake up on Saturday morning to deal with harassment from someone in IMH begging to be discharged. The keyword here is \"harassment\" - she wasn't asking nicely, she was threatening us in a really rude way).\n\nMe and my brother are okay, for anyone worrying. Things like food, water, phone, internet, and utility bills are all good since we are financially stable for now. We do not need any assistance on that front.\nAny questions can be directed to this account's DMs, although you might not get an instant response, which I apologize in advance for - this account is only logged in on my computer, and I am not on the computer all the time.\n\nEdit 1: Thanks for all the responses!! I will try my best to respond to everyone, but I am unfortunately fairly busy especially with this situation on-going :(.\n\nEdit 2: I just dropped by IMH and spoke to the nurses there, and obtained some key updates. Firstly, her phone is confiscated for now due to her using her limited access to it to harass relatives on Whatsapp. Secondly, I have obtained confirmation that her MHCTA has been \"upgraded\" from 3 days to 1 month for now. Thirdly, I will get IMH memos from the doctors there to get the ball rolling for my younger brother's affairs, and the mortgage. Last but not least, we are thinking about getting me and my younger brother's legal custody to my grandmother for the last stretch of our childhoods.",

I will assume that once I have this, I can pass this on to someone that is of age (I am below 21) to allow them to help them and my brother apply for the passport.\n\n3) Another commenter already mentioned this partially - AFAIK, no one has access to her bank accounts except for her, but we still have a game of figuring out which of my mom's accounts (she has a lot of bank accounts) the mortgage is getting deducted from before we transfer money into it monthly. We would also need to figure out the amount we need to pay for the mortgage.\n\n4) Good point, but I am not too worried about the bills for now, since she will be hospitalized for some time (at least a few weeks), and from my experience with other relatives getting hospitalized, the bill is only sent when they are discharged.\n\n5) I will heed this advice (consulting with them) when I head there in person later to get a memo.",

Even then it will take a while for them to assess properly. Iirc its about 1 to 2 weeks give or take. Talk to the social worker? Maybe they can find a loophole or channels for this. Alternatively if you can get a lawyer for consult, you can wiggle around to a Lasting Power of Attorney. This allows you to decide/enact anything relating to your mother's accounts.\n\nPoint no 4 yes, however best also to assume that you will be having to process and ensure the payment is done one way or another. Again the social worker or patient services associate at IMH will be able to help on that. \n\nPoint 5, yes please do.\n\n\nEdit: Also whatever communication/letters/advice given to regards to your family and your mother's situation and treatment as well as any action you plan to do please write it down and keep it in a folder. As troublesome as it is, sometimes we forget things and it helps if you have that folder/notes with you.

And then there is also Mobility strategy.\nSecond is Business Partnering, this job only appeared in the last 15-20 years because of business needs\u2019 of having one contact who understands labour law, talent management but ONLY FOR HIS SPECIFIC business. So imagine for example, Singtel\u2026 HRBP for Singtel\u2019s engineering dept will require different skillset for HRBP for Singtel\u2019s customer care dept.\nThird is HR Services, this is usually shared services which now trending in Malaysia and India (because of the lower cost and high efficiency services); their jobs is to do data management, talent acquisition coordination, managing your leave system, do your payroll, administering your benefit and salary increase and bonus (that has been studied and approved by Total Rewards), calculating OT and basically all HR administration.\n\nNow those 3 are the normal model. Bigger MNC like what I work for will have different HR projects like IT improvement, employer branding (under Talent attraction), DEI (diversity equality and inclusion), employee investigation, management effectiveness, HR metrics.\n\nHR landscape has changed so much in the past 2 decades.\nHR Services may be reduced in terms of headcount because of automation and system, but true strategic HR is a game changer for good business. :)",

But a child needs human and peer interaction to properly develop. So schools may regress/transform more into a place with a much higher emphasis on social skill development than a place for rigorous academic training per se. \n\nSimilarly, I think in hospitals, there's zero chance a consultant can outperform an AI doctor, once setup and it can tap into the hospital information systems, has access to all past and present patient records etc. Zero chance a human consultant can do pattern recognition better than an LLM. But we *will* need doctors/whatever new word it may morph into - medical care workers? - to listen to the patient and give him the diagnosis/treatment plan in a humane tone etc. So doctors will regress/transform from being this (sometimes cocky) unique fountain of life saving knowledge to actually being more of translators who are there to deliver medical information to patients in a empathetic way.\n\nSimilarly, we can have the best AI porn in the world custom built on your prompts to fit your personal fantasies.

But after trying to implement a retail AI assistant that answers product queries in real time at a retail outlet and another one that replies to customers on livestreams, I think most jobs are still safe (!!!!). What might change might be\n\n(1) the speed at which new hires are expected to hit the ground running after they're hired\n(2) the expectation that everyone in the workforce to think critically and judge the veracity of information supplied by AI.\n\nI think AI's role in corporations, if implemented well, may be that of an oracle that is very good at summarising domain-specific questions or company-specific questions. Maybe a new-joiner isn't sure about the procurement process of the company and the AI assistant guides that new joiner on what to do. Maybe a part-timer at a retail outlet doesn't know why a 66W powerbank won't charge an iPhone faster than a 20W PD powerbank*, but the AI assistant will help to explain and guide that part timer towards the right direction.\n\nThough, what will change is the expectation for employees to critically think about the information generated by LLMs. I think hallucination is still a major problem based on what I've been trying. The ability to identify and challenge assumptions might be the expectation rather than an exception.\n\n* 66W usually for chinese-manufactured phones e.g. VOOC for Oppo phones, SCP for Huawei etc. 20W usually indicates it will charge your phone with the PD protocol at PDO2 which is what iPhone uses; there are other wattages within the PD protocol but it's just easier to see it this way",

None are taking my advice seriously. They still think Google is the answer to all their needs. \n\nAI will take over the jobs of those who do not ingest and form knowledge within themselves.

And everyone will be too scared to quit. \n\nNo company will pay more staff when they think they can get away with.\n\nThis means that in whatever AI roadmap the governments have, a broad scale reduction of the work week and controls over working hours is important. \n\nWhy? \n\nIt\u2019s better for the country to have 6 people out of 10 employed at 20 hours a week for $4k than have 2 people out of 10 employed 55 hours a week for $8k. We all are still alive and have to buy food and pay for utilities. During the transition period, if governments don\u2019t want to massively scale up aid programs and dip into reserves, this is the kind of choice they will have to push for to make sure the bulk of the population can still get by without going on a rampage. Especially in places like Singapore where you cannot grow, hunt or forage your own food. You need a job, and the economy needs to run.\n\nBesides, if all the companies lay off the bulk of their workforce in favour of AI\u2026 they cut the bottom out of consumer demand with the same knife. A worker that\u2019s out of a job may lose their home, or cook porridge instead of eating out or ordering in, won\u2019t buy any new tech, won\u2019t need to travel and so won\u2019t buy new cars or clothes or plane tickets. The 2 people who remain employed or whatever won\u2019t be able to make up the overall demand. \n\nYou need the broader swathe of humanity able to feed and support themselves in some fashion to keep society going.",

No point worrying about bills if they're too busy trying to un-alive themselves everyday \n\nIf they feel very stressed but it is still somewhat manageable (e.g. therapy, engaging in activities that bring them happiness and successfully distract them from their work stress) then they can still hold on a bit first and seek another job while doing their current job",

Basically their HDB is to be sold and the money split equally amoung us siblings.\n\nRight now I have one sibling with no property and still staying with them, but my parents have made it clear to him that he will not be inheriting the flat. It's a 5-room flat so makes no sense to give him such a large property while the rest of us have 3-4 room flats. Plus wouldn't be fair to us to have to work hard to get our homes while this sibling just gets handed one for free.\n\nSo splitting the money evenly is the best all around. If the rest of us decide to give the sibling this property, that's up to us to agree upon. Otherwise if he hasn't gotten his own place by the time my parents pass away, then his housing situation is up to him to settle.  \n  \nETA: I'm not advocating for throwing this sibling out on the streets btw. If he has trouble securing a place to stay then of course we will all pitch in to help out. But what I won't be ok with is him being handed a fully paid off 800k flat for essentially nothing, while the rest of us has to scrimp and save for our mortgages and are still paying it off.",

Create a commuter rail network, with higher speeds and less stops than MRT lines\n2. Convert higher demand bus routes and corridors to tram routes with full transit priority. \n3. Ban roads with 3 lanes or more in total. We can always use the land for something else.\n4. Actual segregated bicycle lanes, not the red paint on the sidewalk bullshit we have now. \n5. Extend the EWL to T5 instead of the TEL. \n6. Extend the Sentosa Express Monorail to Orchard via Tiong Bahru. Give it 3-car trains. \n7. Convert the ORRS to a BRT corridor.",

I think that would be nice cause I do not want to stop are every stop if I want to go to tuas link. as people suggested, we could either make new tracks for trains to go around stations or as you said, make New commuter rail. Though I think that making a new track to go around stations and for express trains is cheaper and easier than making a whole new commuter rail line\n\n2. Yes, I wish we have trams and not the LRT disappointment we have. but how it is implemented will be interesting and I wonder if it ever gets used in 2 lanes road would it clog traffic?\n\n3. 3 lanes forward and 3 lanes going back right? so 6 lanes total and yes, I think that so many lanes for cars is bad and makes my blood pressure increase from thinking about it\n\n4. I agree, red bike lanes need too be separate from pedestrians, maybe LTA could use the defunct lanes (from point 3) that no longer in use and turn into bike lanes.\n\n5. I never understood well why we will use TEL, and yes, a train going from Tana merah to T5 makes sense\n\n6. I never actually thought of this before, but I will need to research more if monorails are good. The biggest worry I have is that the underground will be too complex from underground shops and exiting MRT lines. \n\n7. I dont know if BRT is good, I only know of the concept recently, but as long as its not cars, I like it",

                "body": "as a malaynial, my advice to you is that your youth is incredibly valuable \u2014 more than you may realize now. Every year in your 20s is worth tens or even hundreds of thousands in opportunity value. You have time, energy, and freedom \u2014 use them wisely.\n\n1. Use Your Freedom Wisely\nYou likely don\u2019t have heavy commitments yet \u2014 no mortgage, no kids, no major responsibilities. This is the best time to take risks, explore, and invest in yourself.\n\n2. Don\u2019t Waste Time on Low-Return Work\nIf your main job covers your living expenses, avoid part-time work that only trades time for small money. Instead, spend that energy building skills, networking, or creating something meaningful that can scale.\n\n3. Do What You Can Only Do When Young\nThere are some experiences that are best when you\u2019re young. Try activities that challenge your body and expand your social circles \u2014 things like barre, bouldering, spin classes, or pole fitness. Save the slower-paced things (like hiking) for later \u2014 they\u2019ll still be around.\n\n4. Pursue Further Education While You Can\nIf you\u2019re considering a master\u2019s degree, this is a good time. Once life gets more complex, it\u2019s harder to find time and energy to study.\n\n5. Get Your Driver\u2019s License\nEven if you don\u2019t drive much now, having a license gives you freedom when you travel abroad and opens up spontaneous adventures and job options.\n\n6. Strengthen Your Friendships\nSpend time with your friends while you can. As people settle into relationships and start families, they\u2019ll have less time for hangouts. Take pictures, make memories, and cherish the phase you\u2019re in.\n\n7. Explore Relationships\nIf you haven\u2019t had much experience with romantic relationships, now is a good time to start. Dating teaches you about yourself, your needs, and how to relate to others \u2014 all of which are valuable life skills. Keep your virginity until marriage as most guys only want sex. If he is serious about long term, he can wait\n\n8. Create and Share\nIf there\u2019s something you love \u2014 a sport, a hobby, a craft \u2014 consider vlogging it. Share your journey on platforms like YouTube. You\u2019ll build confidence, develop media skills, and maybe even grow a side income.\n\nYou won\u2019t always have this much flexibility, energy, or time. Your 20s aren\u2019t just for surviving \u2014 they\u2019re for becoming. So live boldly, invest in yourself, and don\u2019t waste this golden decade",

But firstly after working for so long, one thing is always never enough, SLEEP so usually a long sleep till 12 noon if possible (Pray that bodyclock dun wake me or parents wake me up). The other stuff that I do to destress probably cycling for 1-2 hours weekly if not work out or do some exercise. Binge watch shows or animes and maybe read some comics/manga.\n\nSometimes weekend is not enough, so I fit in work out or playing darts with friends at least once every week or alternate weeks after work. If I am lucky with colleagues who dun mind staying back, I usually hang out with them 1-2 hours after work, be it eating dinner or just chilling at smoking corner. \n\nOver the years I picked up different hobbies like making videos, streaming, but those never stick. I just try whatever people try and if its my type I just move on most of the time.\n\nThis might seem weird or sexist and a very unpopular opinion, to me is when I clean toilet or clean my PC. Its just a satisfaction when you clean something dirty and now it looks clean and smells fresh, its really therapeutic. I have been cleaning toilet since I was in the army back in 2012. \n\nI never picked up cooking before but I might try it someday because my sister seems to enjoy baking and her reasoning was because she is just trying despite never ever cooking anything before 2025.\n\nI don't have a recommendation for chill places since I mostly stay at home because I am introvert.",

Most produce a very loud high pitch humming noise which is as annoying as watching videos on speaker mode.\n\nLast week when I was in the cinema, the guy next to me had his neck fan on (even though aircon is perfectly fine) and the high pitch noise was quite distracting. On public transport it's also quite annoying when someone uses their portable fan.\n\nDo you think it's ok to turn on portable fan in enclosed space with other people or should it be limited to outdoors where it's hotter and noise dissapates better?",

That\u2019s why talking, using your phone (bright screen in a dark environment), etc is frowned upon and not allowed. Using the fan which produces the sound is no go.\n\nIn public transport I think it\u2019s acceptable. There\u2019s no expectations to stay as quiet as possible, so long as you don\u2019t make too much of a ruckus like using your phone on loud speaker or kids monkeying around on the bus/train. The name of the game is tolerance. The humming sound is quite easy to tune out, and if you can\u2019t ignore it, you can always wear your own headphones and play your own music. Given the record breaking hot weather recently and the conditions of some of the buses and trains, I think we can afford to be more understanding towards fan usage.\n\nAlso, in the cinema or theatre, Everyone is expected to be focused to what\u2019s on stage/screen and the humming sound might distract and  make others lose catch of subtle cues in the movie. On the public transport, no one is focused on any one thing. You do your own thing. Money is paid to get you from x to y and not for whatever content is screening. So no loss is affected from the portable fans other than you being annoyed by it (which is not really a loss)",

Her friend was trying to disengage and pull her away, but she was doggedly determined to save my soul. I told her there was no point - I didn\u2019t believe in it. She quoted the Bible, to which I said it\u2019s just a book I don\u2019t believe in. She said I was blaspheming. And I said something like I don\u2019t believe in it. This got her even more riled up. The final straw was when I said that I would only turn up if God himself was gg to be there. \ud83d\ude01 I thought she was gg to have an aneurism but her friend managed to drag her away. \n\nIf JWs came to my place, I\u2019d thank them and decline any follow ups. No reason to be rude.",

        "post-author": "tallgeeseR",
        "text": "Hey guys, ideally during interview, or at least during probation, how do you distinguish if your (potential) team manager is...\n\n1. highly interested in his/her team management profession? or\n2. has little to no interest in team management, but always trying to do the best driven by high sense of professionalism? or\n3. a coasting manager? or\n4. a hands-off manager?\n\nI find it especially tricky to **distinguish between #3 and #4**.\n\n**p/s**: In my opinion, job coasting is not always due to laziness/leeching character. It could also happen when a passionated manager running into a toxic, unsupportive higher-up, making him/her feel career in this org is hopeless, thus decided to do the minimum for temporary while actively seeking opportunity outside.\n\nBtw, in your own experiences, what are the risks and opportunities to work under a coasting team manager?\n\n**EDIT**:\n\nFrom comments so far, it seems there are diff view about what it means by coasting manager. Some of the description sounds like weak manager, hands-off manager, rather than coasting manager to me.\n\nAlthough both coasting manager and hands-off manager usually has lower engagement with team and makes little or no decisions, in my understanding \"hands-off manager\" still watching what's going on with the team and supportive to the team and people, it's just that they feel that particular team performs better on higher autonomy. On the other hand \"coasting manager\" cares about result and delivery so that they can answer to boss, but has little or no interest on their direct reports, e.g. their career development and workplace wellbeing. In short, we could say \"hands-off manager\" is a management style, \"coasting manager\" is an attitude/personal value.",

Like local spend need to hit x, need to film locally etc.  \n  \nPrivate investors, 15% or 20% <- this are the money men. The rich people who got money to throw but they do expect a return. Thicket sale cut or some sort of money back. A lot of this depends on you knowing people or how famous you are. Connections.  \n  \nBranding deals, 20% <- product placement etc. Get your spot on my movie for 20k or 200k etc. If you see a movie suddenly show beats speaker or coke can. You know its a product placement.  \n  \nPre sales to streamers and broadcasters, 15% <- this usually before the movie is made, can make some deals.  \n  \nLocal and international sales. Especially international box office <- this usually are estimates. 20% - 30%? But movie theater might take a cut depending on risk.  \n  \nOwn company funding, or own pocket 10%? <- just own production house money.  \n  \nPrivate investors gets paid back whatever agreement it is, maybe 1/3 cut of every thicket sold or a fix amount of return. If you can break even already good.\n\nIf a movie cost 10m not all 10m is in the bank waiting to be spent. Some money only come in later. Prior commitments of money can also suddenly disappear or get renegotiated for whatever reason. So this industry is very stressful.\n\nSome time producers of the movie don't get paid because there isn't money left after paying everyone and other investors. Passion projects you can also see some Directors that reduce their fee or even don't want to be paid so they can make the movie of their dreams.\n\nEtc etc. if you are interested can read up on the book.

There is only so many marvel movies they can make a year, and they need films to put on the screens, so they know based on past records that Singaporeans do watch Jack neo films. \n\nActual proper filmmaking is expensive, especially in Singapore with our much higher labor cost (a byproduct of our insane cost of living, but that's another topic) so they have to bring in as many sponsors as possible. When you have sponsors you have to pander to their requests as part of the contract, such as a minimum of 5 sec of screen time, a call out to the product, an outright infomercial etc. If you get funding from govt agencies they'd ask for a certain policy to be featured and called out, etc. So when you see the product placement being totally blatant and ridiculous, that's just how desperate they were for funding.\n\nNobody needs to approve a movie being made apart from the filmmaker (and board of film censors, but you can film paint drying for 10 hours and send it for licensing and they'd have to approve it) but unless it's totally funded by investors without strings, you'll always need sponsors.",

From my experience even SMRT\u2019s website is lying to you \u2014 if you check during special operations like a train disruption the website doesn\u2019t show anything different, so its probably pulling data from an internal timetable.\n\nOnly the last train times on the train operating company websites are accurate.",

I had to leave for work by 11AM and the delivery pick up guy sent me a WhatsApp message that he\u2019ll be reaching by 11.10AM. I felt quite confident the parcel would be picked up and so I left it on the shoe cabinet. No one was home as everyone was either at work or school.\n\nI received a call at 12PM from the delivery pick up guy that pick up was unsuccessful because there wasn\u2019t any parcel for him to collect. I was confused and went to check my CCTV and saw that the parcel was taken at 11.40AM by a woman who acted pretty suspiciously.\n\nLater in the day I found out in my neighbourhood group chat that a suspicious woman has been lurking around the neighbourhood and some neighbours have caught her snooping around their shoe racks, cabinets and dry risers from their CCTV for quite a few days now.\n\nI\u2019ve filed a police report but I\u2019m not sure what else to do.

But there are still things you can do:\n\n1. Never arrange pickup when theres no one home. Don't put parcel out. Its one thing delivery ppl do, its another if you do it yourself. \n\n2. Besides police report, let the community know of this. Share on community(your own area) group chat, if there is any, and perhaps request to put up posters with proof like pic and so on to inform the people living there about this. This will bring awareness to people and at least deter the same person to do it again in the same area if they see that people are aware of them. \n\n3. Prepare some sort of locked box(fixed and stationary) to hold the parcel in then provide the delivery person the passcode to unlock to retrieve the parcel. You can also change the passcode for every pickup.",

What more could someone want right? \n\nTurns out, even when you have everything you used to dream of, somehow your mind and heart can feel dissatisfied. \n\nRelationship with hubby has deteriorated after having my kid. Most of the time, it feels like we are roommates. Also, his capacity for engagement seems to have gone from bad to worse. Like he wasn\u2019t the best conversationalist before this, but now it\u2019s like there\u2019s barely any effort apart from the daily routine conversations. \nHe\u2019s a hands on dad I guess, but I\u2019m still the one who carries most of the mental load. \n\nHaving a helper seems like it could relieve my workload, but in reality I am just burdened by daily problems that she gives- always complaining about some leg ache, back ache, family problems. Sulking to do any extra work. It\u2019s a nuisance. I really really wish I could somehow make do without one, but it seems impossible for now. \n\nI feel like I have no friends. Everyone is busy with their own lives and meetups are once every few months. Even calling to chat or replies to messages seem to take a a lot of effort. Whereas I see many others out there having huge gatherings every week. Why is it only me who lost everyone? \n\nThere are several other things that bother me, but it seems like I should just accept it. \n\nThe only time I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m drowning in the depths is when I\u2019m with my kid who\u2019s literally the light of my life. And perhaps when I\u2019m at work cos I\u2019m too busy and distracted to feel anything. \n\nI don\u2019t know who to talk to about this so I\u2019m posting here. \n\n\n\nEDIT: did not expect so many responses. Thank you to everyone, really appreciate the different perspectives. I\u2019ll respond individually as much as I can \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

As such, hear if he shares the same sentiments, and whether he does or he does not, suggest that you\u2019ll like to change a new helper.\n\nFourth, once you\u2019re able to get a reliable helper (I know it\u2019s not easy at all), but through these progress, perhaps you and your husband will talk more to each other etc.\n\nFifth, if successful in gaining a reliable helper, date nights can happen, and you both can build a closer r/s. \n\n\nTLDR: Communicate your feelings but ensure the messaging is right so that your partner doesn\u2019t feel burden by the sharing yet you\u2019re being honest with how you feel too. \n\nTLDR (summary of the summary): Communication is key \ud83d\udd11\n\nWishing you all the best!",

They\u2019re so professional you dont need to teach them anything, they will clean your house like hotel level. I mostly WFH so arranging this is easy.\nI also engage babysitters from babysits before for my older son to help him during bedtime, when me or husband need to work late or have night work call\nIt\u2019s crazy but it works, and no headache of live in helper.\nThis is just a suggestion if your helper doesn\u2019t work. :)",

No helper (which is one less person to manage, but also poses its own challenges like the absolute lack of ability to do anything apart from kids if the spouse refuses to let me off). \n\nI feel very happy with my kids even if they annoy me at times, but I often have intrusive thoughts of just dying the next moment.\n\nFor your problems, I can only offer some solutions for the helper and friends piece.\n\nHelper - squeeze the benefit out of having the helper to make managing the problem worth it. If she enables you some alone time to chill and take for yourself irrespective of your husband, take that time. Reclaiming yourself makes you less upset and stressed. I always feel better when I get to meet my friends for lunch during work days, free from kids. Don't believe for one moment that changing the helper solves the problem. Every helper has their own pros and cons and if they aren't endangering your kid and generally does their work, dealing with the small whining about here pain there pain is better than staking on a new unknown.\n\nFriends - you have to find a few friends you will prioritize. Meer them for lunch during work days. Bring your kid to meet with them for a meal. Leverage your helper to watch them at home with your husband while you take off to meet them. It can be an arrangement like every month for 1 weekend day each, your husband and you get to do something for yourselves. For me I don't have many friends with children so I don't know if trying to be closer with those with kids is helpful. To me it just sounds harder cos 2 x family schedules. Plus to me friends ground me in my past, so I much prefer to just be with my long time friends even if they have no kids.\n\nThen the next part about friends is figuring about what you want to talk about. You need to build a life without kids too and talk about it (hence part 1 on helper letting you reclaim self is impt). Talk about work that's fine too. Or maybe use your times with friend to do new things - like go tufting, or a new type of exercise class, or art jam, or a boards game night - that sure helps you all bond without drifting back to your kid all the time which might alienate those with no kids. I like to catch up on my friends life and just listen and ask. Or we talk about philosophical stuff or current affairs.\n\nFinally the last part I can't help, about the spouse...\n- I seen many posts or ppl saying roommate phase is very common with couples with young kids\n- they say it may pass after that initial phase is over, but takes initiative to bridge things back, rekindle feelings, prioritize each other\n- I do not know if it is true. I find that having kids only turbo charged the flaws I used to find able to accept, and many episodes around those flaws had made me want to off myself or divorce\n- I am just going to ride it out because offing myself will hurt my kids and divorcing solves nothing as it just translates the problems from solving it while under the same roof while solving it not in the same room since joint custody is the norm. Unless of course you get zero freedom to have your own time, then divorce might solve part of the problem. But if it is things like mental load, co-parenting only means you carry the load but control less esp when kids are away with spouse.\n- if you have not tried communicating, you can try that as many commenters have said.\n- but if you have like I did, and feel trapped still (for me it's gaslight and aggression so I cannot progress anywhere), then the only way is to think of the kids and be honest about when does the dynamic with your spouse start hurting them.\n- I use that as my baseline. Once crossed I need to take them and leave. In the meantime I strengthen myself to be able to solo them if needed (so that means building my career), and steel my heart now by not asking for too much from my spouse.\n\nHope it presents a different perspective from all the idealistic responses in the thread",

However im the husband here. \n\nMy kid is one of a kind level of difficult, and yes friends with kids around us says so too. \n\nMe and my wife fought so much ever since my kid came into our lives, my capacity of engagement drops to the point where i rather not talk. We do not even have a maid. I take care of chores, she settle the LO.\n\n 1st question is, are you headstrong as well? Do you hear yourself talk and try to speak in a nicer tone? \n\nMost of our issues stems from being short fused, our snappy tones and the choice of words we use. \n\nDo not harp on minuscule things on parenting, it will eventually tire both you and your husband out. Coming thus far, a child is a child, as long as they are healthy they\u2019re alright. \n\nI do not have friends, i do not spend time outside and i dedicate my free time being present, cause that\u2019s the least i could for my wife and kid, but somehow my wife always feels that it isnt enough. \n\n\nWe do not have grandparents that could help us in taking care of our kid as well. \n\nI do understand that mothers usually bear more mental load as they care more about the gentle parenting side of things, but realistically there is only so much we can do. \n\nTry to go into a deeper convo about the issues with your husband to understand what he thinks and feel. Most times i\u2019ve seen are wives who are mad about every minuscule things that the husband do or say. Eventually this behaviour will tire husbands out. Be the wife that\u2019s chill. \n\nBad news is, going out on a date with your husband will never feel the same anymore, and its ok. It is normal. Love isnt always butterflies, we just have to make things work.\n\nThe happy lovey dovey married couple you see outside? Either one of them doesnt have to work, do not have to fret about money, or they have grandparents who offer help to take the kids off  their hands so they have free time. \n\nThose who are married and can still have huge gathering every other week? Either their kids are easy, or THEY themselves are easy and chill with their kids. Bottom line, every household situation is different, DO NOT compare your family to others.",

My parents and parents in law are basically non existent\u2026 leaving me and my wife to fend for ourselves even when we are terribly sick. \n\nbeing brought up in a \u201ctraditional\u201d family style, us guys are expected to suck it up and not fret such issues too much.

Treats me like an enemy when things get tough. It\u2019s like when im physically present, she says im not really helping despite me settling chores and cleaning up everything else. I end work, fetch my kid, go for dinner, come back home, wash bottles, she put kids to bed, i do chores wash clothes keep clothes and she ends up falling asleep while i keep clothes hang clothes. BUT SOMEHOW IT SEEMS NOT ENOUGH? \n Its like she expects me to be 100% energy towards my kid and everything else. She can show her emotions but i cant. \n\nAnd when i do, im in the wrong and says im not helping.

A bit over budget due to ++. But if there are small eaters in your group, they can share (like 3 people share 2 sets). \n\nPeperoni pizzeria at biopolis might be ok, they have atas looking giant pizzas for sharing, and pasta for variety. Or set lunch if individual portions are preferred. \n\nHonestly for this budget you are quite limited to casual dining spots or even zichar / roast meat / chicken rice at coffeeshops. \n\nThere are some places at one Holland village that might meet your budget. But we don't know how big is your team and if the eatery is big enough for you all.\n\nEdit: I forgot about watami at star vista, they have set lunch too.",

Waking up and going to work was a chore and had 0 work life balance. Work almost basically 5.5 days a week and working hours were 6.45am to almost 6pm, potentially ending later if there are more preparations needed or any extra curriculars to be planned. When I reach home, I'm so exhausted and can barely do anything else. Parents also love to contact after working hours and back then, my principal was adamant on us replying back to them or it seems like we do not care about the kids wellbeing. My health was on a decline, mentally and physically. \n\nI finally decided to leave the role and went to do a low paying office administration job. Struggled a little at first but I learned quick and went on to switch to HR Team at an MNC. Crazy enough, I love it so much, I love coming to office, I love working 8-5, I love my job and I love sitting at a desk with my ass glued to the chair typing away. Everytime I tell my coworkers or friends who have been working office jobs since graduation, they all tell me I'm crazy, but tbh this is truly an upgrade from my teacher role.\n\nHas anyone been in the same boat as me?

You would definitely have to be in school during official school hours (in fact earlier because of morning assembly and depending on your school, you might need to arrive even earlier for morning duty, like standing at the school gate etc.). Some teachers have their own kids so they request for late reporting, this is subject to P\u2019s approval. You may also have after-school duties (e.g. patrol canteen during lunchtime) in addition to CCA and even remedial/supplementary classes. \n\nSo while BY RIGHT, one should be able to knock off right after the end-of-day bell rings, it\u2019s usually not the case.\n\nNot to forget you\u2019ll probably have marking to do/lesson prep (unless you\u2019re not intending to do these like some teachers\u2026). \n\nAnd then if some incident happened in your class, you\u2019ll need to follow up. Major ones, definitely need to call parents; super major ones, will need to write incident report as well.\n\nSchools don\u2019t go by hours. So they don\u2019t stipulate that you work, for example, 42 hours a week (it\u2019s impossible anyway). \n\nIt\u2019s common for teachers to bring work home + work at night + work on at least 0.5 days of the weekend. Not saying it\u2019s impossible to not do so but you really need to draw the boundary and stick to it (and it\u2019s difficult because teachers just have TOO MUCH to do).\n\nOn top of all those, teachers also plan and execute events (National Day, TDD, international friendship day etc.) and have to be part of different committees to carry out other roles (a lot of times barely related to teaching and learning).\n\nEdited to add on: this is for a primary school context. I would assume secondary school would have fewer of those \u201csafety\u201d duties that require to stand at the school gate/canteen/corridors \ud83d\ude05",

Does one have a good day\u2019s rest or does one use that time to maybe prepare resources to cater better to their learner\u2019s needs? Many choose the latter, telling themselves \u201cit\u2019s all for the students\u201d and then end up feeling burned out.\n\nAnd what has MOE done about this? I wonder.",

        "post-author": "Iloveyoko22",
        "text": "Hey everyone! Writing in to ask on opinions on what I should currently do regarding both my career and potential part time degree. For context, My career trajectory is kinda odd because I was previously a loan officer under a SME despite my course of study being IT Since 2017 up till now. Went through Nitec in networking and system administration, HNitec in applications development, and currently in my 2nd year of my part time diploma in ICT Systems, Services & Support.\n\nCurrently I'm working in a IT service desk job, as stupid as it is, my previous job asked if I wanted to head back, I didn't mind because the salary was quite amazing for my current qualification, I stupidly sent my notice (which starts from this 26th may to 6th June). Unfortunately, my previous job suddenly rejected me and now I'm stuck in a rock and hard place. I have been applying for jobs recently but I was thinking to take this time to consider my career path and my studies.\n\nThrough my previous job, I came to realize I really enjoyed talking to people and understanding their current issues, their life, their story (some clients revealed way more then they should but I like that feeling of them being able to open up to me and speaking the way they were, made me so glad!). I also came to realize I loved the aspect of negotiation, I really enjoyed what I did previously in the company but alas, I left because it was 6 days work week and had some impact on my school projects and foreseeing potential \"stale salary\" as I've asked around in the company and realized my colleagues salaries hasn't changed much since they joined.  \n  \nSo for now I'll be spamming to apply for jobs through Jobstreet (not much luck with MCF and LinkedIn) and I honestly don't know what to go with. To pursue something in IT? Or something in business? I know both markets are oversaturated but I still have a preference towards these fields. I'm also planning ahead for a general idea of what I want for studies. I contemplated taking a degree under SUSS for business analytics, but part of me is worried about the idea of AI taking over, I know it isn't taking over completely, but the dread of the risk worries me.\n\nSo sorry for the long post! Figured I put everything here for a better context into where I'm currently at and some history to help, I appreciate any criticism or any assistance in regards to this, thank you for taking the time to read as well!",

Most of these folks voted for Chinese food and a few requested to find place with outdoor or semi-outdoor dining space. The latter is because we have a team member who is sort of immunocompromised, thus enclosed space is a no-no. We only have 6 members (including the leader) and the upper budget is $80 per person. Other than that, no other specific requirement. Thank you!\n\n**Edit:** to all, thanks for the suggestions!",

        "text": "23F here. With the recent BTO launch at Keppel Club, my ex and I seriously considered applying. The location is rare and highly attractive. But as we discussed it more, I realised I was not ready. Not emotionally, not financially. To me it felt like we were in the relationship for the sake of housing. To my ex, it\u2019s about taking a leap of faith. That conflict eventually led to our breakup.\n\nNow I keep wondering. How do people actually know when they are ready for something like this? Is there a clear point when everything aligns, or do most just take a leap and hope for the best?\n\nI would really like to hear from others who have gone through this. What made you decide you were ready, or not?\n\nEdit: To give a little bit more context. I had a really meaningful relationship with my ex. He was thoughtful, kind, and we clicked really well. We were serious, and I did consider marriage. But I do have doubts about our long-term compatibility due to some practical concerns. Breaking point is that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable being pushed into marriage for the sake of grants. \n\nAnd a heartfelt thank you to everyone who shared your story or pov ",

When a couple decides to get married in order to secure a house, it's literally putting the cart before the horse. \n\n> But as we discussed it more, I realised I was not ready. Not emotionally, not financially. To me it felt like we were in the relationship for the sake of housing. To my ex, it\u2019s about taking a leap of faith. That conflict eventually led to our breakup.\n\nI just want to say, I applaud you for this. Too many people skip this step, forgetting that relationships cannot exist on love alone. There is responsibility commitment, work. Yet, it's often downplayed how difficult it can be to admit that you and your partner aren't compatible and walk away. Kudos to you, and I really hope you find your person. \n\nThere may not be anything wrong with taking a leap of faith, but there must be something to have faith in.\n\n> Now I keep wondering. How do people actually know when they are ready for something like this? Is there a clear point when everything aligns, or do most just take a leap and hope for the best?\n\nYou should continue what you have been doing: asking questions about yourself, life, marriage. Everybody has a different point at which they are ready to move into a different stage of life. It's so, so important to figure these things about yourself. You will also find that a lot of answers here don't give you anything to work with. It's partly because a lot of people don't have the answers, even for themselves. They're just getting married because it's the \"next thing to do\". \n\nBut, to answer your question, for myself, it was having a stable career, with some savings and skills to my name. When we'd both been at our jobs for some time, and no longer needed to rely on our parents to survive, is when I felt I was ready to start our lives together.\n\nFYI, I was extremely insistent on it: we'd been together for 10 years before I proposed. For a lot of people, this is too long to wait. But, we stuck by each other because we'd already asked these questions and had these discussions, so we had a pretty good idea of what we were doing, and why.",

Like I met him and I knew I was mentally in a good place to meet someone, love someone and settle down with someone. I look back at past relationships and situationships and are like \u201cwtf what did I see in them.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re trying for the July BTO for the first time - and generally ppl my age tend to buy resale alr cos they wanna settle down quick. But honestly we\u2019re ok, no plans for kids or anything so why need to rush a house? Also almost at income ceiling so better try now hahahahaha.\n\nSo I guess its a mix of reasons but for me I know that he\u2019s the one and I have no hesitation in this big ticket purchase. I have friends who just BTOed cos got high grants when they buy while still in school \u2014 some are in miserable relationships cos they\u2019re just staying tgt for the house.

But if the green signs were there and u took the leap of faith, at least it would be a residual risk which you can't be faulted even it did not turn out well.\n\nSo when you find a relationship that you can move on without red flags then you are ready for your bto.

We were 27 and 28, already a couple years in a job for him, and I was finishing grad school with work lined up. We\u2019ve already been through other relationships. We knew what we wanted, were sure of each other, and was ready to settle down. It\u2019s likely because of this certainty that every step from there on felt anxiety-free with no second thoughts. \n\nAll this is to say that, I agree with you OP. You did the right thing - if you aren\u2019t feeling sure, don\u2019t rush yourself into it. You\u2019re still pretty young, and 20s is the decade where each year is still packed with things that may happen (career, figuring out what you want to do in your life, ageing parents, meeting new people etc). You\u2019ll go through more things and may one day eventually find yourself thinking that you\u2019re now ready to slow down. By then, your emotional and financial state will be different and you\u2019ll perhaps naturally find yourself being ready to make a life time commitment. \n\nSo don\u2019t worry, I think you did great :) some people are comfortable with taking a leap of faith, and some people just aren\u2019t (me included!). Maybe we are just the type of people who need to be certain enough before we make a life time decision. The way my husband and I describe it is that while I think and weigh my decisions a lot for every major step I take in life, when I decide, I move forward happily with it and have no regrets (cos I\u2019m certain it was the best decision then). \n\nWishing you all the best OP \u2764\ufe0f",

Renting a house doesnt make sense because you are throwing money into the sea unless it is short term. Staying with parents will make you lose the newly wed vibe due to various restriction.\n\nHaving been through the process, the best time to get BTO is before both start working due to the grant and you guys can wait. Worse case scenario if you guys breakup along the way is just to lose the deposit and initial downpayment which is about 5-10% shared between 2 person.\n\nSo yeap it is indeed a leap of faith if you were to BTO when you are still schooling.

Do not\u00a0***walk beneath clothing***. Trousers, skirts and panties over head is bad luck for the men.\n4. Do not\u00a0***whistle after sunset***. U might invite the supernatural.\n5. Do not\u00a0***point at the moon directly***. U will incur a cut wound behind your ear/s.\n6. As kids, do not\u00a0***look at the funeral wake directly***\u00a0if u are not related to the bereaved family. It will affect your academics.\n7. Always\u00a0***separate women\u2019s undergarment***\u00a0from the main laundry load. If mixed with the men\u2019s laundry, it will bring bad luck to the men.\n8. As kids, u must\u00a0***finish all served meals on your plate***\u00a0without leaving any grains of rice/food. The amount of uneaten rice/food will appear as pimples/pot marks on your future spouse\u2019s face.\n9. As kids, if\u00a0***someone taps the top of your head***, u must \u2018revert\u2019 that with bumping your chin a few times with topside of your hand. This is to ensure the tapping did not lower your intelligence.\n10. As kids, during meal times\u00a0***do not lift your leg up while placing the thigh close to your chest***\u00a0on your seat.

I am a mid-level manager in finance/accounting with 2 months\u2019 notice period, bonus payout in Dec and lots of leave to clear because I thought I was gonna land a job and had no holiday plans. Sent lots of applications, got a few interviews that went nowhere. For the amount of applications I sent, I don\u2019t think I got a lot of interviews even.\n\nGoing to stop looking for a new job if I can\u2019t find one by end of June and start again next year.

I also had 1 other offer which I declined, and 4 processes where I was the top candidate and went through salary nego but I withdrew after I started my current job.\n\nTLDR: job hunting is a numbers game. Apply for as many jobs as you can (assuming you meet the requirements and don\u2019t mind the job scope). Trust me, the effort will pay off.",

You don't need to complete the project, just need to get involved, then you have something more to talk about in the interview of how you fit their role. \n\nExample for finance, usually the value add is modelling, analysis, how the data tells the story. How you contributed on the revenue side of the company, not just the cost center, not just crunching numbers. So, if that is a current gap that you see, then try to take on a similar project so you can draw reference and examples in interviews. \n\nCurrently finance is also a lot on process improvements. Look at your current role and think of how you can optimize processes. Start working on that, to show the value you can bring to the new company",

That's why you have to be pro-active and fight for your own salary increments, instead of passively waiting for it to come.\n\nIt's also why you'll often get a pay raise when you make it obvious you are preparing to leave, or get a counteroffer after you throw letter.",

I got reprimanded by a HR rep on the second day of work for discussing pay - I looked up the law for this and found nothing (and can still find nothing) on this. To be very clear, MOM **not** saying it's legal is not the same as saying it's illegal.

This is what will happen 100% of the time. \n\n\nNow for true story time.. fortune 500 MNC. my friend and colleagues are part of a global team so they are not all pissy scared like a typical Singaporean. They know what is their right and liberty all that. They are very close and have shared their payslips openly.. and because they have that data point, the lowest earner of that group went to the boss and HR during salary revision and said he was the lowest paid by a significant amount for the same job.. that is even after factoring in the different COL in each country. \n\nTheir boss and HR surely went something like \u201cfuck.. I can\u2019t smoke shit now\u201d. They know you know what you needed to know, and they can\u2019t say \u201cit is market rate\u201d because your data is all there.. he was underpaid because his last drawn was also underpaid. His salary was revised to be more on par with the other 3.\n\nDid they get fired? No.. just reminded it is confidential but salary is not company confidential information, it is personal information so it is confidential to yourself and it is you who decide whether it is public or private information.

                "body": "Just my opinion, and a bit of advice. Its not illegal, but strongly discouraged because of the potential social ramifications that come with it. Fact of the matter is that sometimes up to 30% of your salary is up to your personal negotiating skills. A lot of people can chicken out when it comes to the interview and end up accepting a lower salary, but when told that they accepted a lower salary later they'll freak out and let it affect their work performance and even resign. I dont think I've ever seen a case of salary comparison situation end well for everybody involved. I've seen people forced to resign  (usually transferred to a different department and then put into a black box) after being outed as being paid more than their colleagues, people resigning because they're not paid enough, and people being dissatisfied because they're all paid the same but the workload assigned is different. Not a single case or instance has resulted in people being happy and deciding to work harder, or the management agreeing to increase salaries across the board to match the highest paying employee (actually, once. Once this happened. The highest paying employee resigned, because he's been carrying all the noobs and now he feels underpaid for his effort.). \n\n  \nWe've even had people compare performance incentives. So in one place of employment we'd had a incentive pay structure, which is clearly broken down. Full attendance for the month? 5% more pay. No annual leaves taken in the designated peak season? 10% more pay. Tiered % commission for sales people. Ticked all the performance incentives? Extra 10%. So on so forth. And yet there are people being unhappy about it. Why Timmy gets 10% more attendance incentive bonus than me? Because you skipped work like your mom skipped your schooling la wanker. I work in the same team as Salem, did the same tasks and everything, why he gets more performance incentives?? Because you only did all of that on the days you came to work, and you took 5 days off last month, you fuckwad. \n\n\n\nSo if want to discuss salary discuss it on the context of relativity to the market's worth. Not what your colleague is getting. This is very specifically a case of the saying \"one man's poison is another man's meat\". Anybody that has the mindset to compare salary will also want to be comparing everything else, such as leaves taken, amount of workload assigned, so on so forth. So yeah. Dont compare salaries. Just dont. Even if you get paid the same, the comparison will never stop there. After that will be bonus. After that will be why your leave is approved by mine isnt. After that is why boss so friendly with you but not me. Why your promotion faster than mine? Why your raise higher than mine? Why why why. And it contributes to a very toxic workplace environment. \n\n  \nIn terms of why discussions of salary is included in your contract, its there so your company can fire you if you stir up shit with your colleagues as a result of discussing salary. Its one of those \"I didnt know that something this innocent can cause so much damage! gib me second chance plz\" shit. So if you compare salary and someone else is dissatisfied, you can get written up for problematic workplace behavior causing distress in other people.

It also usually means there are people in the office who are comparing salary, and to warn you away from joining them because it probably isnt the first time they've caused trouble.",

We are a couple who have a 24-hour layover in Singapore arriving around 8 PM on a weekday, and we\u2019re really excited to explore the city together. We\u2019ve booked a hotel in Marina Bay, and we\u2019re looking for some advice on how to get around. Would you recommend taking the subway/airport train, taxi, or Uber(or similar popular apps)?\n\nAlso, since this is our first time in Singapore, we\u2019d love to hear any recommendations for must-see places or experiences that we can fit into our short visit. We want to make the most of our time, so any tips from locals or seasoned travelers would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you so much in advance for your help! We are excited to visit Singapore!\n\nBest regards!",

There is also an area behind Marina Bay Sands (the triple building with the slab on top) called Gardens By The Bay. There are some parts of it you need to pay to see, but highly recommend just walking around the park at night time when they have all the lights on, you can walk back to your hotel when your done (Singapore is also ultra safe so don\u2019t worry about staying out too late).",

They open pretty early too so it's good if you wanna start your day early. \n\nCan go chinatown, explore the area,  lunch at one of the hawker centres there. Can get chicken rice or char kway teow (stir fried noodle) if you want local food. Get a sugarcane juice or a soya bean milk cause it's going to be hot. \n\nGo to sultan mosque, can explore the area, and arab street. Lots of food choices. Get a drink from \"tarik\" their saffron tea is very nice :) \"Mini Keria Gula Melaka\" is nearby they something that looks like a mini donut, very sweet and delicious. Love it. \n\n\"Zamzam\" is an Indian Muslim food place. And it's near, can have an early dinner, get a briyani or a murtabak. The neighbouring shop is selling roughly the same stuff, so just choose one \ud83d\ude02 \n\nThere are definitely more options but I don't think you have the time not stomach space for more at this point \ud83d\ude02 come back for a proper trip to eat the other food Singapore has to offer.",

You might get tired on off days due to night shift and don't want to do anything. Off days you might get recalled for extra duty.  You will not get compensated with extra off days if you need to do work during your off days. The whole team was asked to go training once a month during our off days. I prefer having the weekends off where my family has weekends off too.\n\nManagement.  \nAfter you enter the uniformed services, you realised that the management isn't what you like. Way out of it is resign.\n\nRegimental  \nSome don't like the regimental nature of the work after some time. Being a police has a lot of PGO and SOP. Investigating officers have never ending cases which boss and members of public would like to be handled fast. But then there is a procedure to follow and also case prioritization.\n\nMembers of Public  \nSome members of public are difficult to handle. I did not like handling them.\n\nNeeding to pass IPPT and shooting for promotion / normal duty  \nI understand needing to pass shooting. Its our bread and butter. Fail then need to keep on going retest until you pass. Just don't like the system. IPPT is another hurdle for me.\n\nIn uniformed services, there are forever a person who is one rank above you. The system favours scholars over non scholars. So no point. Besides, I am thinking of the long term. If I were to retire, my pay might drop from $5k per month on a diploma to $1.8k when I retire. What job can I take? Nothing to fall back on. My experience would be counted as 0.\n\nReasons above was why I decided to resign the moment my bond is up.\n\nThe rate of people leaving the force is greater than the rate of people joining the force. Thats why it seems like they need officers all the time.",

So with trial you can see if you like the class or not.\n\nI dont say there is best place to do class since this also depend of your preference of location and price point? Like ally only have two outlet which is at maxwell and telok ayer. Absolute have a few outlets.\n\nIn term of price point, revolution class package was good. If you manage to get on sales, each spin class can be $13. But now there is a few more studios open and so, it is competitive.\n\nLike recently i saw a studio called legione open.

Flow playground is slightly better but the shower area not so luxe. I m not at the stage of paying too much for a pilates class as the classes are mostly 50 mins.

A lot of commercial properties valuations are based on gross rental income (partly because point 1), so if rents drop, value of commercial properties would go down. If said property has a mortgage, banks would ask owners to front cash to ensure mortgage is not underwater. They would rather keep their valuation high.\n3.

I know that facial piercings and tattoos are generally a no-go for the funeral industry, but it\u2019s become a lot more lenient in the US as I have friends working in the industry with twice as many facial piercings as I do. I also have visible tattoos but I can cover those up easily. I currently have an eyebrow piercing and 2 nose piercings (which I can easily hide with retainers) but I\u2019m not so sure about my eyebrow. I just got called in for an interview next week\n\nSo my question is, for anyone working in the SG funeral industry, should I be okay with my piercings when going in for the interview? It\u2019s mainly my eyebrow that I\u2019m concerned about since I have significant scarring around it anyways \n\nAlso, side note, I completely understand why facial piercings and tattoos are considered unprofessional in this industry, especially since funerals here are a lot more cultural and \u2018conservative\u2019, especially since I would be working more closely with older generations who find this kind of accessorising taboo, but I just want to know if it\u2019s okay to keep them in for the job interview ",

For general education requirements, we learn cosmetology, theology, chemistry, biology, anatomy&physio and whatnot. then there\u2019s also lectures on philosophy and psychology. for the course itself, you learn how to cremate embalm on bodies that are donated to the school! also throughout the course you get the opportunity for an apprenticeship at a local funeral home. unfortunately, i had to drop out of my school before i was able to get to that point because the political situation in the US got so bad that my campus was no longer safe to be on if you\u2019re not a white american-born citizen :// i\u2019m really hoping i can continue my studies again soon",

One of them is beancurd, the other is pudding. They're both soft, sweet and delicious. You can find the pudding one in bus interchanges.",

What important safeguards should I take at this point (eg online ntuc income account, etc?) should I report it to income because I haven\u2019t been contacted or identified as one of the 100 plus who were affected by the data breach? Many thanks in advance. Advice is appreciated \n\nEdit: thank you for all your responses. I\u2019m asking if there is anything I should be concerned about because these guys have my personal details. I am full aware of the precautions to take against scammers - I did not give away any additional details nor fall for any scam. \n\nUpdate: I\u2019ve also installed scam shield and filed a report.

Went to the pets expo and saw a few barking.)While you're there,  just be more alert and check on your cat and leave asap if she shows any signs of distress.

They are not necessarily attention-seeking, but reputation-conscious. Doesn't apply to every kid of course, but this is quite the norm now. \n\nSo, kids will absolutely love it if you can offer them something that will help them look cooler and be a bit more popular among their peers, or even make others envious. In other words, something that they can bring out and show off.\n\nAny gift that is only meant for private consumption, such as books or home/room decor or even Lego, will be appreciated but not adored. \n\nAnything they can show off, like an Owala or Stanley bottle, or a bag or pouch or shoes from a highly trending brand, will make them super happy. Yes, the item may only serve them for a year or even less cos trends will change quickly, but they will remember the person who gave it to them and helped them be cool for a few months.

                "body": "Back in primary school, I was friends (read: acquaintances) with a guy from another class who was known to be severely allergic to nuts. Like if he ate a peanut, his throat would swell, his trachea would close up, and he would likely suffocate and die. \n\nI can't remember his name so let's call him Bob. \n\nApparently Bob developed the allergy out of nowhere, and only found out after a rather big scare when he bought nasi lemak for lunch, which obviously came with a small serving of roasted peanuts. This happened during primary 2 or 3, I can't exactly recall. After that incident, the school canteen stopped selling food with common allergens. \n\nAnyways about a year later during another recess, Bob saw someone else at our table eating a homemade sandwich covered with Skippy's peanut butter and jam spread. He then said he always wanted to have a P&J bread again but never was able to try it ever since that incident a year back. \n\n(I think you can already see where this is going.)\n\nHalf the table being dumb 9~10 year olds thought that it was a great idea, including the guy with the damn sandwich. Everyone at the table egged him on to Just Do It. The guy with the sandwich stopped eating and set down the bread to join the cheering. \n\nThere were other kids around who were more mature and seemed like they wanted to step in and stop the dare, but they were drowned out by 15 or so hyperactive kids yelling \"PEANUTMAN\" and \"EH DON'T NOOB LEH\" (you can guess my age from the lingo) \n\nAt the same time, teachers were alerted to said shouting. No shit right? \n\nSo allow me to imagine what some of the teachers must have been thinking:\n\nMr. Tan: \"whoa whoa whoa what is going ON?! Fighting is it?!\" \n\nMs. Suriati: \"aiyoo what now, I also need to eat one leh\" \n\nMr. Zhou: \"\u54c7\u64cd\uff0c\u5403\u9971\u6ca1\u4e8b\u505a\u5417?\" \n\nAmongst all the shouting, Bob pondered for a minute. He shot a look at the P&J sandwich. He looked up around him at his unexpected group of supporters. He looked back down at the fluffy white bread covered with the coveted brown nectar.  \n\nSensing that the teachers are approaching fast, he knows he's running out of time. If he wants to try a peanut spread, his best bet was to do it now, pray he survives, then ask for forgiveness. It's now, or never.\n\n__\"fuck it, yolo\"__, he thought to himself. \n\n_Ok I don't actually know what really went through his head. It was probably \"I not noob!\" or something stupid like that._\n\nYeah so anyways he reached over to the sandwich and took a bite out of it. \n\n. \n. \n. \n\nSo that's it right? He ate the thing and his throat immediately starts closing up and RIP he's dead now, and everyone got their parents called. \n\ngg no re try again next life. \n\n...\n\nWell, no. Not exactly. Because my mans came prepared with a secret weapon: an Epipen.\n\nFor those not in the know, Epipens typically contain epinepherine, a medicine(?) that's used in cases of accidental intake of an allergen. The epinepherine works to reduce or sometimes stop the allergic reaction that would have happened. You need to uncap the 'pen' and reveal the needle tip, then jab yourself with it. Except this case was anything but accidental.\n\nImmediately after the madlad chomped a chunk out of the P&J sandy, he whipped out the Epipen ala Lightsaber and committed seppuku with it. \n\nWell, at least that's how it looked like to me. \n\nA moment passed. Bob seemed fine.\n\nThen a few more seconds passed. I start to see Bob widening his eyes.\n\nWhat was it? Was he widening his eyes because he finally tasted a divine sandwich after a year of not having one, or was it because I'm watching him inch closer to meeting the Jade Emperor?\n\nTurns out it was the latter, because the dumbass was apparently supposed to jab himself in the upper thigh instead of his stomach like a weeb samurai.\n\nNow he's really dead-dead, and everyone got their parents called, and a bunch of kids got suspended due to this. \n\nOk no. Not so fast there. If a primary school kid died in school because of something like that, you'd remember it from the news.\n\nBob had better count his blessings because the alerted teachers managed to make it to the scene. One of the teachers had the foresight to call the school nurse, who arrived just a few seconds after and immediately started CPR and mouth to mouth.\n\nAnother teacher rushed up to Bob's classroom, dug through his bag, and managed to find a god damned SPARE EPIPEN his parents packed in, and ran it back down to Bob. Did his parents know this was going to happen? Who knows? Maybe this whole shebang wouldn't have happened if the kids had the same foresight the adults had. Dumbass kids. \n\nThis time, the epipen went in the **correct** injection spot on his upper thigh. The nurse decided to pull his pants down so the injection was more direct though. I don't think Bob could have taken a risk there. \n\nHe was able to breathe normally after continued CPR from the school nurse. \n\nIstg how lucky is this bloke? He gets a 15 minutes of fame witnessed by almost half the school AND he scores with the hot school nurse who also was horny enough to pull his pants down in a public space? (im kidding **I'M KIDDING**) \n\nWell. God damn Bob, good bet I say. Good fucking bet. Wherever you are now, I hope you're doing well and also just a little bit brighter than you were in this episode.",

Has satisfaction when we went shopping and she snatched the last piece of item I wanted then \u201cthrow\u201d it aside after buying. Would make her parents buy her things I had (she was from lower middle income and sometimes financials are tight) just so she could have it same or before me. As we grew older and as adults, wanted to know all my friends and say it\u2019s her friends too, pretended to know things I didn\u2019t tell her. Subsequently a lot of people were irked by her and unfriended her but still reached out to me and asked to hang without her. Last straw was I was having very bad anxiety, i had an episode and her parents were concerned and I had to explain it to them . She found out and  heard part of it went to IMH herself randomly to get herself diagnosed, describing my same exact symptoms and reactions. And apparently now we are the same and she\u2019s very relatable and is taking same medications but her condition has not improved and worsened it\u2019s just stuck at the same as what she heard halfway of my symptoms. Because it\u2019s family friend, and I didn\u2019t want to cut things off entirely (grateful to her parents they are unaware of her craziness because is \u201ca good girl\u201d in front of parents. Dad passed and at his deathbed asked me to look out for her knowing she doesn\u2019t have much friends), I only go to her place and hang out with her mum is there once in a while.",

And she unfortunately developed leg issues where walking long hurts. And the walk to her hawker is 10 15 mins long only but painful liao.\n\nOne of my uncles got her a pmd, fking life changing. It was at that moment I really appreciate the PCN and silver zones thingy that exists in her neighbourhood. She can move around, maintain her friendships etc .\n\nSo I don't think it needs to be an activity or even a regulated space what not but just the existence of communal spaces like hawker centre and the ability to reach said places is enough for the elderly folks.\n\nIt's possible for them to make friends there , and get entire network of support. And volunteers will know where to go to find them cause they're there almost everyday. \n\nSo I hope the elder gen in sg can at least get connected to such spaces and I hope it goes beyond the \"within x km\" kind of statistics but these spaces are provided with the thought of how the elders can even reach them. That at least imo is a good baseline , no activities needed , just support and the human connections in their later years goes a long way already.",

Wake up at 7am, do prayers, then 8am stroll around neighborhood, then breakfast. Go home rest and prepare simple lunch and eat at home. Afternoon take a nap. Do reading, writing or some hobbies. Dinner and tv time, watch video for self learning. 2-3x a week to go out with friends or relatives for lunch or tea.\n\nOther times, they need to go medical appointment. And it's important to go for a biweekly massage to clear blockages in the legs. Just like the way we maintain our car or house cleanliness. If we don't maintain our legs by going for massage, only go to Dr when legs have serious issue then it's harder to recover mobility. \n\nI can't see myself getting old going to senior center to kill time. I rather do own learning, or attending lesson for spiritual studies or hobbies. I will enjoy massage sessions to maintain my health. And if I'm well enough, it's nice to go for pilates or yoga or meditation lessons for seniors.",

        "text": "Hi all, I\u2019d appreciate some advice.\n\nI recently signed a written offer for a 12-month contract role at a well-known MNC. The offer letter only included my monthly and annual salary, without detailed terms like benefits, CPF contributions, leave entitlement, medical coverage, or the termination clause.\n\nHR mentioned they\u2019re preparing the full employment contract and also sent onboarding instructions with my future manager in CC. But it\u2019s been a few days, and I still haven\u2019t received the final contract or benefit breakdown.\n\nI\u2019m currently working full-time and want to resign respectfully \u2014 but I\u2019m hesitant to do so without having all the formal documents in hand. At the same time, I don\u2019t want to appear slow or uncommitted to the new company.\n\nFor those who\u2019ve worked contract roles in Singapore or with large companies:\nIs it normal to resign after signing just the offer letter? Or should I wait until I receive the full employment contract?\n\nWould really appreciate any insights or personal experiences. Thank you!",

        "text": "Just started tapping into the dating scene after ending a long relationship (28). So far had a handful of first dates after being on dating apps for 2-3 weeks (across 6 months) , and they were all at a restaurant. Sometimes it does become like an interview, which gets awkward when the vibes arent right (especially when the person wont ask you back any question). \n\nWould like to hear from you guys what are great first date places/ ideas in Singapore that are both affordable and allow for good conversations and catch each other\u2019s vibes? (I think watching movies for first date is a bad idea because you are forced to sit silently for 2 hours).\n\nAlso, isit weird for the female to suggest first date places in SG? ",

Is that why they were so frustrated?\n\nI've seen the colour scheme voting posters put up by the town council in adjacent blocks when they were going to be repainted, but I don't ever recall my flat ever having a vote despite having been repainted twice while I've lived here (I think).\n\nI guess the town councils must decide? But why do some do it while others not?\n\nAlso, who decides on the colour schemes that we can vote on? And how did some flats wind up with super unconventional and interesting colour schemes like the Mondrian coloured flats in Teck Whye / Chua Chu Kang?",

The house is lovely after a night view. However, i was a little surprised that the owner played quran incitation at night (those player, similar to buddhist chanting machines placed at funeral wakes). May I know if this is normal? Because I have viewed other houses but the muslim owners do not play it. Or this is actually subjective and up to each indvidual - some may be more pious? Hope to gather some insights from you",

Some people play it on a radio.\n\nIt's not typical, but I wouldn't say it's not normal either. The typical Muslim household tries to involve the quran to strengthen their faith. After all, Muslims need to pray their 5 daily prayers.\n\nWhat you've mentioned here is one way a family or an individual would like to be in remembrance of God.\n\nMaybe the individual can't sleep due to personal problems; personally, I sometimes turn on the quran when I have a sleepless night.\n\nIt really depends on the individual. Tbh, if I had a neighbour who's always tuning in to the quran, I'd see it a positive sign. For muslims, it implies that such a house is at peace or upholds islamic values to a T. A good time to strengthen neighbourly bonds!\n\nMy neighbours and I share and give food to each other during CNY, Hari raya, and Deepavali.

Changi City Point is 1 MRT stop away but nothing special except some outlet stores. The condo cluster nearby is a dead zone as far as amenities for public is concerned\n\nI would personally choose Caldecott if both are standard. Being near NS (Braddell), CCL and TEL is a major advantage.  If Caldecott is prime/plus then I might need to think abit harder.

It's supposed to be for those who are eligible for re-employment past 63 years old up to ages 67 or 68 depending on your birth year. \n\nI've been reading up on the criteria and we are quite sure my relative meets the criteria. We're trying to ensure my uncle gets the payout as it is very likely they will not rehire him even though he is not at the retirement age yet. Unfortunately, he cannot afford to retire.\n\nI'm particularly keen to know: \n\n* How was the application process for you? \n* Did your employer cooperate or was there resistance when it came to certifying eligibility?\n* Did the employer try to offer you a new position that is unreasonably far/does not fit your skillset to try to get you to quit on your own? \n* Was TADM able to help at all if there were unreasonable terms/EAP amount?\n\nDM if you're more comfortable sharing privately!",

I thought coding was the \u2018too much effort too little reward\u2019 kind of work, overly complicated, and just not my thing. If I took a career test back then 100% it would show that tech was not for me. I always avoided it wherever i can, and didnt learn how to code at all.\n\nThen something happened and I had no choice but to fing another field, and tech was the \u2018indemand\u2019 one. So I thought I would swallow my pride and just learn coding a bit. Still hated it. But i wanted to at least get to a certain level of competence, so I practiced coding every single day, even as I hated it, for months.\n\nThat was until I started getting good at it. Suddenly, the barriers I had put up in my mind were being torn down. After practising so much, I realised, eh, actually its not as hard as I thought it would be. with practice, its actually not too bad. but i still didnt have passion for it, just found it more bearable.\n\nThe real passion started when I got confident enough to use my skills to deliver actual value. I started to do real good work, and people began to be impressed and start respecting me. It spurred me on to go on and on. Now, companies depend on me for critical production issues, and I get paid really well. The pay, respect, flexibility u get from the job helps you be really passionate and happy with what you do.\n\n\nso yeah i know long story but my point is that maybe to really like something you have spend quite a lot of time and effort into one sector first. you need to grind it out to a point where you start enjoying it.",

It may be hard for your company to justify how their access to your health results is reasonable in the circumstances.\n\n>**Section 18 of the PDPA**: \"An organisation may collect, use or disclose personal data about an individual only for purposes \u2014 (a) that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances; and (b) that the individual has been informed of under section 20, if applicable.\"\n\nAdditionally, under the PDPA, an organisation must not, as a condition of providing a product or service, require an individual to consent to the processing of personal data about the individual beyond what is reasonable to provide the product or service to that individual. This means that if the healthcare company made it mandatory for you to consent to disclose your personal data to your company **before** you can qualify for the checkup, that consent may potentially not be valid because such disclosure is not reasonable.\n\n>**Section 14(2) of the PDPA**: \"An organisation must not \u2014 (a) as a condition of providing a product or service, require an individual to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data about the individual beyond what is reasonable to provide the product or service to that individual\"",

For progression, there has been folks who started there ,work hard and end up as FnB Director now. That's when your pay can hit over 10k.\n\n\n\u00a0On top of that, do not use agents, go directly into hotels. Just approach any hotel HR and ask for a casual labour job. They pay 37% cpf on top of your take home which spikes your pay . Usually full time jobs actually take away 20% from you instead of topping up the 20%.\n\n\n\u00a0So you can build your cpf to buy house later.\u00a0\n\n\nMeals are all free, you will save alot of money.

If you can speak well on your experiences in internships or projects, that will be better than like 80% of people. No joke. Most Singaporeans that are fresh grads are terrible at speaking. It's just not a strength in our education system.. \n\nSecondly, focus on keywords on your resume. Hopefully you did useful things during your internship days that can help there. Most resume in singapore read like a checklist of their work duties. \n\nGo for roles that have multiple positions open. Fighting for 1 role is really hard, you have almost nothing that can stand out from another 100 grads so it's much better just be worth hiring vs best for the job. \n\nThere is no perfect job. Especially your first job, getting your foot through the door and gaining experience is more valuable than anything. If you really want a good long career, don't be too bothered about work load, wlb, pay at the start. Yes, you will have to fix this down the line, but it's much better to do a bad job when you are younger and fix it while you go. I know many here will hate this and say, your mental health is more important, will be so hard to fix your pay. It's true, but if it gives you an advantage over other in your future career. Or it's a job vs no job, then it's really better than nothing. I took awhile to fix my pay as well when I started 30% below market. But because of the experience and exposure I got. I caught up by my next jump. I got a higher pay than most of the after the next jump. And had higher than median pay for my age, degree and industry in the next jump. All within let's say 3 or 4 years. \n\nRemember your first job is just a job. Not a career. You can leave after like a year or 2 without much repurcussion. You can change an industry. You can even try to go for fresh grad programs in some places after a year of working.",

Otherwise, for most companies out there, I don\u2019t think referrals are very helpful.\n\nLinkedIn and mycareersfuture were helpful for me. I set up job alerts for my interests so I could be informed quickly when suitable opportunities came up. My strategy is to firstly read up on what the job required and tailored my resume to have those keywords, secondly to read up on what investments or initiatives the company is doing at the moment (so u can bring up during the interview, it shows your interest in the company). Thirdly to NOT have any expectations when applying for jobs, I consciously did this to prevent myself from becoming too attached to any one job application so I won\u2019t feel defeated if I didn\u2019t get hired in the end. It helped me persevere in my job search.\n\nAll the best",

I did. And the person asked me whether i could come down to do an interview the next day (thur).\n\nAnd at that pt of time, i had a training session with my friend on dat next day, so i told the company that i would prefer to do it the following week as i wasnt really free for the rest of the days dat week. \n\n(yes, most would hop on the interview when given the opportunity. But i was extremely tired of having to deal with rejections n bs from the different companies dat i just thought why not i just do things on my terms.)\n\nLater dat day, the person msg me whether im free on any other timing. And i told her i would like to have it at 2pm ( coz my training was 430pm), then she told me any timing dat is 5pm ish. And i was like,\" aiya, i mean, since u asked me twice alrdy, ill just come bah.\n\nSo i went down for the interview, and was told to do some assignments so that they can hv a rough gauge of what i can do in their line of industry. (yes, i hv past works, but not the work dat was related to their industry) I was like thinking of just giving one more shot for it. Spent 2 days in doing the assignment ( painfully ) and submitted\n\nAnd 3 weeks ltr, they got back to me, saying i got the job. I cant tell you how extremely happy i was when i heard the news.
