        "title": "Is Careerist a Scam or Legit? Full Review & Student Experiences",
        "post-author": "MyHatIsAPigeon",
        "text": "I\u2019ve been researching tech bootcamps for a while now and ended up going down a rabbit hole of Reddit threads trying to figure out if Careerist is actually worth it. The general consensus I\u2019ve seen is that there are a lot of mixed reviews, but people seem to agree that if you're committed, you can get results, especially in tech sales or QA automation.\n\nOne thing I keep seeing is that Careerist provides job placement help and mentorship, which sounds great, but there are some concerns about how realistic the job guarantees are. Some folks say they got interviews within weeks, others say it took a few months. Their \u201cinternship\u201d program also gets brought up a lot, seems helpful for your resume, but not everyone thinks it's that impactful.\n\nCompared to other bootcamps like CourseCareers or TechSalesU, Careerist seems a bit pricier but offers more support in terms of one-on-one coaching and hands-on projects. Their QA and tech sales programs in particular get mentioned most often.\n\nBased on everything I\u2019ve read on Reddit, Careerist seems like a legit option, but I\u2019d love to hear from people who\u2019ve actually gone through it. Was it worth the money? Did you get hired? Would you recommend it in 2025?",

        "post-author": "Gamergirks",
        "text": "Basically, i\u2019m 16 years old, and i work part time at a grocery store. When i came home last tuesday my mother surprised me with a vacation to some kind of holiday park, my grandparents are coming too. I got really excited since we don\u2019t have a lot of money, and don\u2019t go on holiday often. Now, my boss expects everyone who can\u2019t come in to tell him 3 weeks in advance, except when you\u2019re sick. I already found this a bit weird because at most stores you only need to tell them 2 weeks in advance, but that\u2019s besides the point\u2014 Now like i said, my mother surprised me with it, and told me only one week in advance.\n\nI immediately sent my boss a text message saying that i couldn\u2019t come in that day and explained the situation. He left me on delivered for a couple of days but came up to me today, because he had only then read my message.\n\nHe told me that he was annoyed with me since i told him on such short notice, now i would understand this if this was an actual well paying job, where i work all day, but no, i work 2 hours a day (can\u2019t work longer on school days according to the law here) and make 5 euros an hour\u2026. \nI told him i barely know  anyone here and that the people i do know can\u2019t cover my shift because they got school, and he told me that if that was the case i should just come into work that day, and miss my vacation. \n\nI kind of get his point, but im not the one who planned this, it was my mother, so how is it my fault? I can\u2019t tell my mother what to do can i? \n\n\nI am seriously confused on what to do now, because i don\u2019t want to miss our vacation tang my mother spent a lot of money on,   but  I don\u2019t want to get fired either.

It's almost important to mention that when I was hired I was told that after some short period of time I would get a quarter an hour raise and start running a register. That never happened. So already the managers were liars. \n\n30 years later I'm reflecting back and I honestly can say I don't think there would have been any reason not to move me to cashier. I never complained about the work. I did the nasty garbage. I cleaned the bathrooms. I went to the bottom of the hill to push the cards up. I had a good work attitude. \n\nAnyway, I had a bunch of school stuff come up. 3 weeks where I had something for school every single day including the weekends. And I don't mean like I had school during the day, which I did, I mean I had some official school activity every night after school during the week for those 3 weeks and activities on the weekends. And I think there was a school trip in there somewhere. This was all band stuff.\n\nI went to the manager in advance to explain the situation. That I had an official School functions and I could not work for those three weeks. He said I could not take off. So I told him I quit. He told me that was very unprofessional. \n\nEven my 16-year-old self knew that he was in fact being the one who was unprofessional by not acknowledging that school comes first for a 16 year old.",

(this is /workadvice not /comfortme)\n\n1st what country is this? it matters - european countries have strong union rules and not saying he can fight the decision but rather (regardless of where) make sure that this doesn't go on paper (or digital) anywhere.\n\n2nd Is Ops job in any way extracurricular? He said 2 hours a day - so maybe? Point is - many school programs can request or atleast promote/encourage outside learning experiences/activities/sports. For example International Baccalaureate requires 150 hours equally between sports and social activities. These usually get documented through the job provider. If this is the case, then OP should defo involve adults in order to avoid a 'bad rep': moreover, if this is the case - jobproviders do NOT have the same authority they would on normal employees and jobs given for such criteria (which could boost the rep of the institution giving the job) should NOT have same expectations equal to normal employees.\n\nFurthermore, employing a minor - depending on local laws and the job in question, would have different expectations than of an adult. Even ignoring this, an adult job provider having a underage employee has influence over them (both for age and hierarchy) and should be extra careful not to take advantage of the minor. There are reasons AND laws that protect childhood labor and I would at the very least ask an adult to go and talk/represent OP in this conversation. Possibly record the conversation too.\n\nThis is not to say in any way that OP shouldn't go on vacation - rather, **that his boss needs to be torn 33 new assholes, possibly one on his forehead too, so he can have a good hard stare at his own poop everytime he goes.**\n\nif this ends up happening i need an update (and photoproof)",

If that is the case and 2 hours screw his business plans maybe he shouldn't be managing a business. \n\nalso 3 weeks notice for a cornershop? i'm sorry but im almost tempted to call the post fake. but jokes aside - strange that you don't see malicious intent by the 'boss man' here. \n\nAre you sure your not 'boss man'? seems from your points that its almost personal. am i wrong?",

Send the mature text that one commenter offered, and go on the vacation. Hopefully you'll still have a job when you're back.\n\nBut also take this as an opportunity to let your mom know how important it is that you know in advance when you need a day off. There will be times when jobs are hard to find and you need to eat and pay rent, so you'll skip Christmas dinner if you have to in order to keep a job. It sucks, but it happens. Ideally you want to avoid being in situations like this, so make sure your family understands that when you have a job, you've made a commitment, and they cannot plan your time without checking with you first. \n\nBeing reliable at work is a key part of what will allow you to move up financially so you'll be able to afford vacations when you're an adult",

My boss must be doing this on days when he has to submit payroll. I work in a rehab facility where we are required to have a very high productivity. We are required to do frequent group therapy sessions each week where we see six patients at once, which raises our productivity significantly. The days when I've noticed the additional 15-20mins on my time sheet were days when I've had large group sessions. \n\nI'm guessing he added the additional time because maybe my productivity was \"too\" high? I've had times in the past where I've made a mistake with my billing, but he's approached me about it and it was a simple fix. He never approached me about any of these days where my time in facility was adjusted. \n\nI'm just confused and somewhat paranoid that I keep making a mistake that I'm not aware of, and I'm going to get fired. I've worked here since 2018 and have always been one of my boss's favorite employees and other than a mistake here and there he is always very happy with my performance. I also feel guilty that I've been getting paid for more time than I was actually in the building for. I'm not sure how I should approach my boss about this. I'm pregnant and hormonal and already have anxiety about confrontation. \n\nAny advice on what to do? ",

        "post-author": "Faulty-Screw",
        "text": "So my uncle Tom (54M) has been having trouble with his boss (57M) recently. The situation started 3 years ago because there was a woman in the office who did not do any work. They work at an engineering company and the problem is she barely showed up to the office - worked four hours a week (*a week*) in a full-time salaried position, skipped meetings, ignored deadlines, insulted coworkers to their faces, and *still* collected a $100K paycheck for all that. She and my uncle feuded because he was sick of her attitude. She told him \"who are *you* to tell me what to do?\" when he asked her to put in more hours. Ma'am - that is your direct superior. This went on for a while but her lack of ethics and responsibility was disrupting the group projects, nothing was getting done, the managers were getting mad at the lack of progress and the situation got so bad, my uncle finally had to let her go.\n\nOf course, instead of accepting responsibility, she threw a tantrum, ran to HR, and tried to sabotage his career with false accusations. Too bad for *her* \\- my uncle had documentation, emails, logs, etc. HR looked over everything and took care of it.\n\nThere\u2019s a form HR makes you fill out when you terminate someone, asking: \u201cWould you consider rehiring this employee?\u201d My uncle checked \u201cNo.\u201d That meant if she ever reapplied, HR would automatically screen her out before the hiring process even began.\n\nNow, the woman is back. The woman worked at Amazon for 2 years after being fired but wants to come back to the company because Amazon didn't offer as much flexibility - meaning, Amazon actually expected her to *work* for her salary. So now she\u2019s trying to crawl back to her old company where she could collect six figures for loitering and contributing nothing. Now the boss is forcing my uncle to consider her application. If he considers the application, that basically means she joins the work force right away despite the fact that she literally did nothing and insulted everyone in the group.\n\nThe worst part? My uncle's boss *hates* my uncle because he fired the woman. He was happy with her regardless of what she did and it got to the point that the boss was reported to HR by another coworker because he cussed my uncle out during some meeting, withheld increments, pressured him to accept nepo hires, and more. It was bad. But relations slowly improved until now.\n\nI almost forgot to mention - remember when I said HR is supposed to reject her application before it even enters? Her application, which should have been automatically screened out, ended up back on my uncle\u2019s desk. Turns out, the boss called HR (IN THE WEST COAST) - outside his branch - **to override the internal HR block** and force her application through. And now my uncle is being forced to reaccept her. My guess is she and the boss kept relations outside the office and that is how he knew about her application before it even came.\n\nSo now, accepting her means she would act worse than she did previously but rejecting her means the boss would hate and torture my uncle at work even more which she would gleefully join in on. The boss is the head of the branch, the CEO of the company on the east side and my uncle works right under him.\n\nCan someone please advice what to do?",

From nepotism to friendship to people really good at getting away with shit, most women aren\u2019t screwing their way into success (or leniency).\n\nBluntly, I've seen it happen, several times in my career. It ain't pretty. I've worked with a number of highly intelligent and very talented women, but it does happen, and particularly in male dominated fields (like, frankly, mine) men will sometimes just start drooling and turn their brain off when *any* woman applies for *any* job. I've had teams of straight men desperately try to make excuses for an obviously unqualified woman they wanted me to hire because she was young and pretty. (For the record, I have a great history of working with and hiring women and minorities. I expect that when I take over a team it will be much more diverse when I leave than when I got it. I am a minority in a number of ways myself. I just don't hire staff to be eye candy.)\n\nAt my last job, they were hiring for an open position for my peer (senior computer programmer). Now mind you, I had 40 years of experience in my job, my peer would be someone *very* senior. I was asked to participate in the interviews. My boss and I had a pattern for interviews - I'd ask questions while he watched, then he'd give them just one practical scenario for which they had to write a tiny program. They could do it in any language, even English, and handwave over any verbose parts, as long as they made clear how the program worked. They wouldn't be told what our relationship was or who was the boss. \n\nWe had one candidate... I wasn't too optimistic when I saw her resume, 11 years of experience in softball roles. As soon as we walked in, she turned on the charm at me. She had a very tight low cut top showing cleavage, and very short miniskirt showing lots of leg. She made a big show of crossing, uncrossing, and recrossing her legs often while talking to me, and leaning toward me to show off her cleavage. \n\nShe didn't know I'm gay.\n\nI have a list of about 260 questions, divided into 12 categories, sorted by difficulty within each category. I start with a mediocre question in each category, and depending on whether or not they get it right they get a harder or easier question. In this manner I can place someone's skill level quickly, and an average candidate gets asked maybe 20 or 30 of those 260. \n\nShe got them all wrong. Not just \"I don't know\" - I can take that answer, I expect a professional to not know everything offhand and say they don't know and would look it up - but she very confidently gave a wrong answer to every question. I ended up asking her all 260, because I couldn't believe she was getting *nothing* right. I'm not kidding 260 questions, not one answer even close to correct. \n\nThen my boss gave her his scenario and asked her to write a simple program. The moment he spoke to her she switched off the charm offensive to me like I'd ceased to exist, and started primping and preening in his direction. Little did she know, he was happily married to someone he thought was better looking than her.\n\nHe asked her his first scenario, and she fell down entirely, couldn't even figure out where to start. (Mind you, these were deliberately easy, we intended them to show how someone approached the problem, we assumed they would definitely be able to solve it.) Okay. Normally they get one but he had 6 prepared. (I wrote them for him, but he liked to ask them.) He gave her another one. Same story. A third. This time she tried, but it was quickly obvious that the approach she chose was going nowhere and she couldn't finish it. All 6 ended up being either \"she can't even start\" or \"she starts off in a direction that can't be resolved after she painted herself into a corner.\" \n\nI came away feeling that she wasn't even qualified to be a junior programmer, let alone a senior, and that she was clearly unqualified for the jobs on her resume, so either something fishy was going on or it was all a total lie.\n\n\\[1/2\\]",

We told him, in these words, \"She's the worst candidate we've ever seen for any job, and she'll tear the team apart. For the love of god, don't hire her.\" (I think my boss said it and I agreed.) John said that okay, he'd talk to her for a few minutes so she could feel that she was taken seriously because she was already told she'd be meeting with him, and then let her go. So she went into his office, and they closed the door.\n\nWe thought that she'd be in there for 5-10 minutes. 15 ticked by. 20. 30. My boss and I were openly discussing \"what the hell is going on in there?\" Finally they emerged, John showed her out, then he came over to us and told us that he'd hired her and was making her my boss by demoting me. (It was a titular demotion, I didn't get a pay cut, so I couldn't really get the state to intervene.)\n\nOver the next few months, any time any guy ever expressed the slightest disagreement with her over anything, no matter how small or how politely phrased, she'd go running to HR, tell them that he made sexist remarks or made a pass at her, and demand that he be fired at once or she'd sue. HR gave her her wish every single time, and half the department got fired. I saw pretty early what she was up to, so I made sure that I never ever talked to her without one or two witnesses. I warned my coworkers that I thought she was dangerous and nobody should ever talk to her alone.\n\nShe started trying to get me to invite her to join me for lunch alone, and I just made polite excuses. Once - just once - I let her join me when someone else would be there, but she started a shouting match with him at a restaurant, and I both felt concerned about whether that restaurant would want me back and worried that I'd have to be his witness at a firing meeting.\n\nSure enough, my day came anyway. John talked to me about a task, she had given detailed (frankly insultingly detailed) instructions on how she wanted me to do it (I remember her saying \"I have *11 years of experience*, I know what I'm doing, you'll do it my way\" and I was thinking \"yeah, and I have 40, but I don't see *you* listening to experience\"), and when I described the problem and her demanded solution to it, and I didn't even need to point out the flaw in her plans that would make her method not work, he saw it immediately and told me not to do it that way, and that when she asked about it, I should ask her to talk to him.\n\nSo I did it my way, which also happened to be his way, and at the next day's team meeting she demanded to know if I had done it and how. My response was \"respectfully Sheila, John asked me to please ask you to talk to him about that.\" She flew into a rage and stormed out of the room. A few minutes later I was summoned to John's office, and I asked the rest of the team to come with me. John was uncomfortable about their presence and asked me to get rid of them. I said that I felt they had important input that he'd want to hear. He then launched into a speech about how I'd been rude and sexist to her, and it was clear that he was headed toward firing me. I interrupted and told him he's mistaken and what actually happened and got the rest of my team to verify that I had it exactly right. I also reminded him that *he* asked me to say that, and I used his exact wording. John was clearly taken aback that I not only was disputing her lies, but I had witnesses that I'd been polite and respectful and done exactly as he asked. He then started to make some remarks about sex discrimination and I said \"I'm gay, I really have no interest in mistreating any woman.\" (This is a polite way of saying \"don't try to fire me for being sexist to a woman unless you want a lawsuit for you being anti-gay.\") It eventually came down to him saying \"well, don't do it again\" and letting us go.\n\nIn part because of the stress of it all, I ended up having a heart attack and 6 strokes and I was actually dead for a minute and a half. I happened to go to the best hospital in the country or I'd still be dead.\n\nSo bluntly, your accusation feels... sexist. I am not speaking out of my ass, I am speaking from actual experience. It *does* happen that some women play on their femininity to get what they want at work. You don't like it, I don't like it, but it happens. And it sounds like it might be happening to OP.\n\nAs a gay atheist cripple, I know about stereotypes, I've been dealing with stereotypes all of my life. I also know that although most people aren't a stereotype, occasionally someone is.",

But, I've seen it in my own office, although about 20 years ago. 5 people including myself, applied for a newly created supervisor job. Ranking candidates by seniority and skill, I expected I'd come in third but tried for the position for the interview experience. Stunningly to everyone, the girl who got the job (who I would have ranked last), was chosen. She'd only been in her job for a year and was known to the department as a total \"F-up\" who no one wanted to be on a project with. 6 months later, imagine the blow-up when hiring supervisors' wife filed for divorce, started a bitter custody and asset battle, and named you know who as the affair partner? Looking back on it, the garbage took itself out :) Going back to the stereotype, well sorry, it happens.",

The new system should be the manager overseeing 2 workers and a wellbeing rep and a weekend worker and weekend wellbeing rep.  I'm in the new worker position and the other worker quit not long after I started because of the wellbeing rep.  Now both workers are technically new, I've been there 4 months and the other 1 month.\n\nThe wellbeing rep is a piece of work.  Self centered, thinks she knows everything, oversteps into everyone's business, takes all the \"fun\" jobs, takes work that isnt hers and takes credit for it and acts like she is the boss of everyone.  When the weekend worker comes in on a weekday when the manager is away the two of them become \"mean girls\".  They do fuck all work and leave it to the two new workers.  They both kiss ass to management in a big way.  They attempt to undermine us and tell other staff that we are unable to do the things that they do.  They don't teach, just tell us what we do wrong and how deficient we are.  The most unforgivable acts in my mind is when they fuck up they try to blame it on the new staff, thankfully we are older people and document EVERYTHING and can prove it was them and not us.\n\nLast week they decided to take the fun job and when we complained that the instructions from our manager state we are to do it they pulled out \"we are a team\".  Well the \"team\" managed to screw up and the new team member didn't get to leave at the end of their shift on time and I didn't get to have my 30 minute break.  They took scheduled hour long job and turned it into 3 hours of work.  We have documented this and now need to say something to our manager about the bullshit we are experiencing in an attempt to have a functional workplace. I like my new job and plan to stay, I can distance myself from them all by the structure of my job (I work in a different building to the others and am only reliant of them for my break).\n\nAnyone got a script I could use or a plan?

The next step is \"I do not want to talk about that private information.\" If he then ignores it and continues to ask, it's \"I am not going to talk about that, it's too private.\" While it's unlikely he will ignore you then and press on, if he does the next step is to talk to your boss or HR and explain that he is pressing intrusively for personal details and you are not comfortable with him and definitely do not want him to know. \n\n(Regardless of whether you talk to the boss or not, I'd definitely let HR know that I don't want that information released in case he decides to go directly to them.

He had gloves \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 and when I hesitated because of how hot it was, he raised his voice at me. He said something on the lines \"are you serious dude\" and told me to go home after the first job. He didn't let me get my last hour in.\n\nEarlier that same day, he got really frustrated while looking for a battery and ended up punching one of the toolboxes.\n\nI'm currently in a plumbing apprenticeship. I\u2019ve been here for about two months, and while I\u2019m still learning, I\u2019ve noticed that this particular person is often rude and very impatient with me.

I feel like I thrive when I work with them, but with this guy, it\u2019s stressful and demoralizing.\n\nThe tricky part is that I\u2019m on a 6-month contract, and I want to make the most of this opportunity.

But that's the thing, the overnight manager himself wouldn't let me. Plus not to mention the fact that he let his personal pet peeves get in the way of my physical injuries. I have a bad knee and I sat down to stock the bottom shelves, then he came over and started yelling and holler at me to get up and how that is a \"pet peeve\" of his and not even proper employee policy. \n\nThat's all exposition to the proper story. I called the next day and said that it just wasn't the position for me, and figured that was that. I figured \"hey I tried it, it wasn't for me, and I'll get paid for that one day. No biggie\" \n\nA week goes by, no pay as expected because it was that first week you don't get paid.\n\nA second week goes by, definitely should have been paid, so I call up the manager and ask, \"hey why wasn't I paid?\" They say it's because my onboarding paperwork wasn't finished (I never got the chance to even do it, they just put me out on the floor) and that I need to finish that before they can pay me. So I do it over the phone, and figure \"that's that... Again\"\n\nA third week rolls round. No pay. I call up there again, every day of the week trying to figure out why again. The manager tells me the paper wasn't sent. So she sends it, and tells me to call tomorrow. Then tomorrow rolls round and she doesn't even come to the phone, she has the co manager tell me that it'll either be a direct deposit next week, or a paper check the next truck delivery (which they had told me twice by this point).\n\nI went up there today just now to ask about the paper check, and they tell me it'll be direct deposit for a half day. Wait.. HALF DAY? I worked a full day! did the math and it was like $103 before tax, $70 some odd after tax. Half a days pay wouldn't have even been worth it, hell A DAY'S worth was barely worth it. They know they owe me a full day, but they are just trying to dick me around the whole way.\n\nI've been informed by some people that I trust to call corporate and explain it to someone there and tell them about how unhelpful the manager was, and they also said to contact the D.O.L. if I do infact get paid for half a day. \n\nAnyone else know anything I should do? Any extra advice? I know it seems petty to worry this much over a single day of work but I could really use the extra bucks. \n",

        "post-author": "ratratte",
        "text": "Hi! I have got a new supervisor and a new fellow intern. Me and the intern have got the same previous work experience, and he is younger than me. However, he quickly became the star of our team. I understand that I am a horrible worker (I have problems with speed and quality, and I have no idea why), but I really do everything what I can and give 200% of my effort at work and I love my job. I think that the culprit is the chronic stress I had been under for many many years, so it doesn't help when I am compared or criticized or given incorrect advice (e.g. \"well just be less perfectionist because of course that's the only possible reason someone is so slow lol\" when in fact I care about speed and efficiency much more than about extra quality). If anything, it makes me even slower. \n\nThe supervisor made sarcastic comments about my speed (when I did my best to be fast and was already frustrated and self-blaming by being unable to) with the other intern, and accused me of doing and hiding a mistake which I didn't do right in front of an important colleague. She has blamed me for being a bad leader when I gave these two a good enough task to do and left because I had to check the work ahead and whether we needed to make changes in the plan, and I received an angry call that I left them without a job to do and went away. I return and see the job done incorrectly and in haste, and she told me and the other intern to re-do it later. Later that day, I needed to check the field again, and I called the other intern over and did all the proper \"show and tell\" on the plan, I circled everything they needed to do and wrote the numbers, and left him the plan. He signaled that he understood the task. I left. I return, the work is not done and the supervisor was sitting down and smoking before lashing at me that I am such a leader that leaves people without a task and leaves. But I did leave them the plan and had explained what to do. She said it was not understandable... even though it was perfectly clear and the other intern had indicated he had understood. \n\nOne day I had zero time to plan the next day important work, and had to improvise. I was given the other intern as a helper, and was juggling explaining him the task he should do and planning out the work right on spot. It was very stressful, partially because he kept commenting and rushing while I was trying to plan, which didn't help. But in the end we accomplished everything that was needed to be done there, so even though I felt bad for not having a plan and my first reaction was to self-blame and moral self-punishment, I was trying to be proud of myself for at least improvising as well as I could in this stressful situation. When I realised that after the improv planning it was more of a one-person job, I sent him back to the office to finish it off myself. I return to the office and the first thing I hear is that I cannot plan anything, I did everything bad and wrong, I should have done this and this and that (which only a mega brain could come up with in such friggin stress) and that the other intern does it much better and I should ask him to plan for me. I was pumped on adrenaline, so I just smiled and nodded along and of course I am horrible.\n\nThe supervisor keeps mentioning the other intern in situations where it doesn't even matter, for instance we were missing something from the inventory, and she went: \"the other intern did this inventory, everything is in order\". Or I called her to make sure about a task and never mentioned the other intern, and she said: \"I explained to the other intern that it's not needed\". A couple of times she had been explaining the task only to him and without even looking at me. \n\nI tried to ask for advice on how to improve from these both, but I received only thinly veiled \"you don't belong to outside work, you belong to the office nerdy jobs\" even though I hate computer-based jobs and I love where I am right now, even though I suck. I would never change my physical, nature job for an office job, I would just wither. The other intern keeps giving me unsolicited advice and telling me how to do my part of a job, and of course it's nice to some degree, but I am tired of being advised so often. When he offers some idea, it's taken with \"Oooh good thought! Let's do this\", and when I offer something, 99% of time it's discarded.\n\nWhat do I do? ",

        "text": "I been working at a snack bar for 4 weeks now and it's been fine until I got scheduled for Wednesday night shifts. Where I met the most inconsiderate coworker ever (let's call her Vivian). For some context, there are 3 of us on night shift, me, Vivian, and Harry. Here are my issues with her:\n\n1. Vivian is on facetime/livestream the entire 5 to 5.5 hours she is working (she often comes late) in the corner of the kitchen. Actively blocking the stove, microwave, and mini fridge. Also since her phone is propped up on the microwave, we appear on camera when have to use the stove or grab things from the fridge.\n2. She hogs the stove to make elaborate meals for all her family and friends (we get one shift meal). Which I wouldn't mind if this didn't happen every single night and if she didn't neglect customer orders to make them. She also leaves multiple times during the shift for 10-15 minutes to talk to her friends and family.\n3. She starts cleaning one section of the kitchen 1.5 hours before closing, getting in the way of our attempt to cook. And only cleans that one section and proceeds to stop cooking the rest of the night.\n4. During closing, she takes the register and tips to divide up, which is actually an excuse to sit down and talk on her phone and steal our tips. One of my other coworkers told me that Vivian only divides up the credit card tips and keeps the cash tips. So on Wednesday night, I regularly checked the credit tips, it totaled to around $51, meaning each of us would get at least $17 since there was money in the tip jar as well. Since she starts cleaning super early, while me and Harry are cleaning, she takes the tips and register and counts them in the back office. Once I finish closing I grabbed my tip portion and it was $17, which should be more since the credit tips were more than $51 and there were cash tips as stated before. But it's hard to check because she takes her tips first which is unusual since our managers usually leave it on the counter for us to take our portion first so we know it's equal.\n\nDespite these issues, I am unsure how to deal with this situation because her dad has worked at this location at the bar for maybe 20 or more years and everyone likes her because she gives them free food. My managers are too nice to say or do something (I told one of them and they just told me to tell the head manager. And the other coworkers seem to just ignore the situation and work around it. Like I said I have only worked here for 4 weeks and new to working in food service in general so I don't know how to bring this up and unsure if my managers will take me seriously. Any advice is greatly appreciated!\n\nEdit: She works 6:30-11, while I work 5-11, so only 4.5 hours.\n\nUpdate: I messaged one of the managers and she said she would look into it. In addition, bunch of my coworkers came in early today and said they would definitely be willing to speak to the head managers regarding the situation. However, I was informed by Harry that he has tried to report Vivian before to no avail, so he hasn't tried since.",

This is my first time finding myself in a situation like this, but essentially I (24F) was hired 2/25 from a referral from a friend D(25M). Things were fine the first few weeks, each morning I\u2019d say hello to D at his desk then walk to mine to start working. His superior F(45-50ishF) Then reports me to the office manager for \u201cbeing a distraction\u201d to D. My direct supervisor R(43M) was informed and pulled me to the side to let me know and to also \u201cdon\u2019t worry about F, she\u2019s a bit\u2026 difficult.\u201d \n\nSince then I\u2019ve caught her staring at me multiple times everyday, to the point where I\u2019ve started staring her down in response. I know it\u2019s not a very mature response, but from everything I\u2019ve heard about F it\u2019d only make the situation worse if I try to speak to her. Our office manager is aware of this, as well as D telling them that I feel uncomfortable around F. \n\nI learned a few weeks ago that F initially thought that D and I were dating so maybe that explains the dislike? \n\nI\u2019m able to put F out of my mind until now. My issue now is that as I was entering the building a few days ago, F saw me about to pull the handle through the glass door and purposely sped up, so I couldn\u2019t grab the handle, quickly pushed the door open and speed walked away, not holding the door open behind her. F knows that this door is extremely heavy as I hear her complain about it. As a result it swung shut very fast and would\u2019ve hit my shoulder/the side of my head if I didn\u2019t react fast enough. In my anger I shouted \u201cThanks!\u201d very sarcastically and walked off. \n\nThat was just kinda the breaking point because it felt so personal? I plan on speaking to the office manager next week, who is aware of F\u2019s \u201cpersonality.\u201d Is that a bad idea?",

It\u2019d seem like we had a nice chat - talk about ourselves, show interest in them, etc.) but then it wouldn\u2019t get any further. They did stuff with other people outside of work, start conversations with others and kind of ice me out and deliberately avoid me. I thought this was made worse by the fact I was absent(off sick) so much that I had a disciplinary meeting, but on the other hand was also refused any holiday for my first 7 months there (apparently there was never a good time because too many ppl were already on holiday and only a certain amount of pole could be off at any one time).\n\nHowever, I also made a good friend from that job - they refer to me as such as well and we still meet regularly. Thing is, this person is also extremely well liked by the other colleagues there, who know we\u2019re close friends, but the blanking continued and when I\u2019ve returned there they\u2019ve blanked me whenever they\u2019d walk past and some even made it seem obvious they were trying to avoid having to cross paths with me.\n\nWhile this is frustrating and made me feel socially excluded and left out while I was working there (and when I visited to meet this friend) when I started my new job, I made positive relationships quickly and easily, endless positive comments from managers and colleagues alike. \n\nIs it possible this is a workplace environment issue, or is it me?",

I ended up having to use my personal laptop for almost everything and bought my own keyboard for when I needed to use my work laptop. \nAfter mentioning it many times, I finally told them that I really needed a new laptop to be able to work. They let me buy a new one, with a budget of 250$ and I tried to find the best reviewed one, but for 250$ the options were slim. \nMy new one works OK for sending emails but takes forever to load doing basics stuff (I HAVE to use an Ethernet cord for it to work at all). However, I have had it 4 months, and have not been able to successfully get on a zoom or Microsoft meeting. \nIt has been so embarrassing that I end up using my phone (personal) for every meeting now. \nI know my nonprofit has a small budget and I was grateful for a new laptop, but I literally can\u2019t do my job at this point without using my personal items.\nI just found out we had several thousand dollars budgeted for something that didn\u2019t get used because my new boss was unaware of it\u2026 so they put it toward staff salaries.

This is the typical department to have this responsibility.\n\nI was blindsided because:\n1. I had discussed with the executive who owned this responsibility & others about me making the full transition to own this specific work responsibility. I was basically doing the work anyways.\n2. This decision was made a week after I had discussed with various people to fully own this.\n3. I've not been made aware directly by my boss (other people from other meetings that I was not a part of, told me this)\n\nIt was apparently communicated by my boss that he wants me on more important things.

        "text": "The main body of this story happened over a year ago but it's important to the current issue so bear with me. There's a TLDR at the end though because this got longer than anticipated \n\nI (25NB) work in a relatively large small company in a comparitively small town. I started off there when I was 22 out of uni.\nAfter a few months in the job, and having friends there now, my manager found out that outside of work I use they/them pronouns (I had never mentioned or insisted on it in work say job isn't particularly social and it doesn't hurt/offend me to be referred to at she/her). My manager, with the best intention (though admittedly misguided) briefed to this to the team. \n\nWhile most of the team adapted or at least tried to one member, Dane (50s M) suddenly had a problem with me. Constantly referred to me in feminine terms, with feminine adjectives etc. and while this didn't offend me in and of itself, I knew the intention was to offend me and that was irritating. It was manageable though. I told my manager it was happening so it was noted and went about my days. \n\nNext, out of nowhere my birth name came out of his mouth. Now, Ive gone by the same name since I was 18 and the reason for the change had nothing to do with gender. My OG name was gender neutral  (think Alex, Cameron etc), I changed it for some personal reasons. \n\nSo hearing it from my random coworker was a little concerning. I asked him how he knew that and he acted like he was Sherlock fucking Holmes when, long story short, he found my family through my FB and went back in thier timeline to before I was 18 to see if I was referred to differently. I was. Which is less detective work than creepy. \n\nWhen he refused to stop calling me it, I spoke to my manager again. She spoke to Dane. Nothing changed. \n\nI tried to ignore it. \n\nNext was the homophobia, I was single at the time though I was going on dates. I'm bi so the dates varied in gender. Dane often made comments about WLW relationships being sexy but how I would ultimately end with a man which is 'how it should be'. \nAgain I reported it to my manager. Who reported it to her manager nothing happened. \n\nNext he approached me while I was talking to my friend Rachel (19 at the time) who is, importantly, not white. He made a comment or two about 'her kind' and insinuated she wasn't there legally. I defended Rachel pretty aggressively, more so than I had ever defended myself. And somehow Dane still managed to end this conversation by suggesting a three way. \n\nAgain I reported it to my manager. Who went to her manager. Who went to her Boss (Dan). By this point getting very frustrated. \n\nFinally there was a week of nonstop hate thrown at me including but not limited to telling me LGBT people didn't deserve rights, stating that being gay is 'a fashion choice', stating that me and Rachel would make a very 'exotic' night for him and finally (after trying unsuccessfully to involve another older man in his hateful speech) tells to 'get back in the kitchen where [I] belong and make [Him] a coffee\"\n\nAt this point, having given up on chain of command, I went to HR personally and spoke about it. They were (to my surprise) unaware of Dane. I had been assured on all my other occasions talking to leadership roles that they had alerted HR as to his behaviour. \n\nHR spoke to Dan who, suddenly, thought this was very serious and had a meeting with me and HR where I chose to file a formal complaint. Dan asked if I would accept an apology from Dane. I said no. At this point I had experienced nearly a year of hate and harassment. I didn't want an ingenious apology \n\nDane was suspended for 2 weeks pending investigation where they spoke to my manager and Rachel and other witnesses. \n\nAt the end of the 2 weeks Dan pulled me aside. Said that Dane had received an informal warning  and had apologised to Dan, who believed he was sincere and Dan had accepted it\nThis sent me insane. \nWhat did he mean an informal warning to my formal complaint after they had (by their own admission) decided that I had told the truth and it was unambiguously hateful. And even more so, how dare Dan accept an apology on MY behalf?!\n\nAnyway, I took some time off after this and when I came back had a very stern, formal meeting with Dan about HIS behaviour to the situation \n\nIt's been about a year and a half since this and having worked my way up the company since I'm now in a position  in which it is my job to monitor and audit the work the work of a group of employees. I'm not a manager, I'm not thier boss, I simply make sure their paperwork is in order and thier behaviour is within the legal/moral guidelines to any client. \n\nDane is one of the employees in my group.\n\nUntil this week, in my role, I'd had no cause to interact with him but, well, Dane isn't very good at his job (the same job he's been doing since before I started) and had come to the room I work in to ask a question. \nGenerally speaking, you should direct questions to the person responsible for you (so me) but we all help whoever has a question. Dane approached and I was the only person available. \n\nI asked how I could help and... nothing. Didn't even acknowledge me. I asked again, he looked at me and then away. I ask AGAIN and finally he asks his question. \n\nWhile I'm answering he turns and starts talking to a person walking past about music. Then asks me the question again. While I'm answering he interrupts me with a very rude \"you could have just said no\" \nLike yes the answer was no, you can't do that, but I was explaining why and how to instead approach the problem, within regulation. \nSo I try to answer again, he turns and walks away, turns back to call me useless. \n\nIt just feels like it's starting again\n\nTLDR; my coworker was incredibly hateful to me, I raised a complaint, my company are basically useless and told me not to interact  and now that my position involves monitoring him I HAVE to interact with him and things have not improved ",

If you identify to the company a person who is harassing you or discriminating against you, they're obligated to make it stop or you can sue them and have a court hold them liable for the discrimination and/or harassment, because they knew about it and didn't put a stop to it. Your company clearly knew about it.

It was only an option he was interested in after HR got involved and even then, his idea of civility was to act like I didn't exist (which was okay by me) but unfortunately that's not an option anymore\n\nI can answer your question though about why they have never fired Dane. The simple answer is that turnover is pretty high in the company. The majority of the roles are low level, low pay and thankless. The company is pretty terrible at keeping new employees and they're aware that most people working there don't want to be. In my entire time there 2 people company wide have been fired. One for destruction of company property and one for stealing from the company.\n\nDane had been there a really long time, the shifts are flexible about him, his dream job (that he does freelance) and he doesn't complain about the work. \n\nI worked in the same job as Dane and I hated it. I stuck it out while searching for other jobs and eventually was offered jobs within the company.\n\nI can even give you his side of the story to HR when I did report it \n\"I thought it was funny and not that deep.

        "post-author": "ememtiny",
        "text": "Hello\nI need advice! I started my sorta new job about a month and a half ago. I worked at this company in 2018 left and was rehired. I am so happy to be back and love my job. \n\nI am catching on well and I remember a lot of things from back then though there are a lot of changes. The issue is with my assistant manager. He is with us in office and my manager is in his home country due to visa issues. Therefore, he misses out on a lot of stuff of course. \n\nMy assistant manager for the few weeks did my training and it went very well. He was friendly and helpful, I felt comfortable going to him and asking questions. After about the third week it all changed. His mood towards me was sorta rude and like I annoyed him. I was doing well and one comment he made during training he was like, wow, you really remember a lot of this. It is sorta technical type of work. \n\nJust some more about about the company and work in 2018 that might help. Our big boss who is now overseas and kicking ass used to have the title of my current manager with the visa issues. Our big boss back in 2018 we were just starting our department and it was just him and three other people trying to get business and figure stuff out. So I have a great relationship with the big boss. We joke around and have stories, etc. He was in the US when I started and came in to the office to work and see me. He never comes into the office! We were laughing and having so much fun catching up. The assistant manager seemed irritated. Also, my department now has 15 people and is making crazy money. \n\nAnyways, another person was added to my group and the assistant manager is acting nice to him right now. He is brand new to the industry so we will see if he remains nice. I don\u2019t know if he sees me as a threat because we have the same background, I worked at the company before him and know how it was back in the day, I\u2019m female and he is from a country that are misogynistic, and have a good knowledge of the industry. \n\nSo I was hearing him talking to the new hire who was asking questions and he was giving him information that he never told me!! Then my last week of training I recall we went over something and he was brief and didn\u2019t mention key parts to it and I ended up doing it wrong until my coworker showed me the correct way to do it. In addition, my last part I used to do in 2018 that we went over in training and when he mentioned I remembered a lot of it, he won\u2019t let me work on this specific type of work. I know how to do most of it. I just need to learn the last part because there is a new way to do it since I was there. Basically I feel like he is gate keeping if you will. \n\nFinally, I have a catch up with my manager today and I want to know if I should mention this to him? I am frustrated that I am missing vital info, I feel like I will miss out on learning opportunities because he won\u2019t want me to learn, and just shitty attitude. I don\u2019t want to get retaliated. What do I do?\n\nThank you ",

Having good rapport with the big boss may also help, as the assistant manager is potentially creating a hostile work environment. Being concerned about retaliation is understandable, which is why I mentioned your rapport with the big boss. You may have to bring it to them since your manager is overseas.",

The only reason you would tell someone that is if you REALLY wanted to work there and you wanted to pressure them to make an offer faster; but even then you should be prepared to get rejected quicker if you aren't their leading candidate.  \n\nThe only downside to you in taking the current offer and then leaving soon after or even before you start, is that you risk earning a bad rep with a few people.  In most cases, that's not a huge deal and any negative effects would probably be short lived.\n\nI can tell you I recently had someone accept an offer and then back out before their start date.  It created some \"pain\" for me and if he came back to me tomorrow and applied again, I'd probably eliminate him immediately.  If he re-applied in a year, I'd probably forget about the whole thing and MAY even accellerate his interview process because he did so well the first time.",

The top-tier schools think there is no where better to hire from.\n\nWhat is 8k? 8k less than 100K, or 150K?  or 8K less than 50K?  What is the job market like for your field?  how hard is it to get a job?  If you are in the Humanities, Theology, or Education, there may be a lot more applicants for the role.  If you are an Accountant or probably some streams of engineering, cybersecurity or AI in computer sciences, you might have your pick of jobs. You'd have to know about the particular field.\n\nIf this is a doctoral job, are you published?   How competitive are you on that front?\n\nIt's not uncommon to take a step down from the school you studied at in terms of salary or prestige.\n\nDepending on where you live, an hour might be ideal.  If you are in LA, there are a lot of schools, but an hour commute for something relatively near might not be unusual either.  But out in the boonies, an hour to another university is pretty close.  One hour is a driveable distance.  I drive about 45 minutes.  It's not that bad, especially if you teach two to three days a week, work from home sometimes, then do the occasional drive-in for a meeting.  What other alternatives for academic work are there in an hour's drive?\n\nAsk them how long the offer is good for.  Don't tell them you are looking elsewhere.  You could tell them you have some personal matters to consider (e.g. other job interviews...but don't say that!), and you can let them know by X date.  See if you can extend the date as long as possible.  They want to get their positions filled also.  Do you have another interview or potential job offer lined up.  There is no guarantee of a job offer.   You may have to 'satisfice' here.\n\nIt is not fun to be out a whole year without an academic job.  I speak from experience.  Hopefully you have another job to tide you over.  Grad school can be so time-consuming, that can be hard.\n\nAlso, ask professors at your school their opinion on it.  It's the summer.  Maybe they will answer email.  You could find out who is teaching during the summer and drop by during office hours.  Talk with the dean.  The dean might know salaries better.  You can also look up state employee salaries for the same role to get an idea.\n\nIf the salary is enough to get you started, don't be too picky.  Is it tenure-track?  That's valuable right there.   And the five-year contract alone is valuable.  Do you get summers off?  There could be more money for summer classes if you work summers, or you could find someone else to do.\n\nIt's easier to get a job if you have a job. If you work in academia, publish a bit, and apply part-way into a tenure track role, that's an alternative.",

I started to take a look at myself and wise up and realize I need and must and can do better. But today after almost having an asthma attack  I was taking long with four really heavy trash disposals to throw away outside. I took very long because I was by myself and they were very heavy and I was wheezing a little bit and I was  hoping to make it through this so I can make it home because I still got to walk 8 Miles home. Maybe it was a wrong decision but after I got back inside I asked my coworker if my manager was complaining by any chance that I took long he said yes and I became very angry.  I strongly felt that I don't deserve to be complained about after the first time because I'm starting or trying to do better. Thankfully I was thinking why don't she do it by herself without anyone's help and I guarantee she will take an hour or more so she has no right to complain about me because I have given today no reason for anyone to complain except just now after almost having an asthma attack I'm still angry. I'm so tired of them",

I already accepted this job (job A), done fingerprinting, got a TB test, did a physical, but I recently \u201cpassed\u201d an interview for a different job (job B), with much better pay and benefits. Although I haven\u2019t technically received a job offer yet from job B, I want to plan ahead in case I have to take back my job offer from job A (obviously I would not decline the job offer at job A until I know for sure that I got job B). I also would be starting job A in about a week, so hopefully I hear back from job B by then. Sorry if this is confusing lol, I\u2019m just stressed. Any advice will help!!!!\n\nEdited to add: obviously I know this would not be a good look which is why I\u2019m asking for advice. \n\nEdited to also add: yes I meant decline/turn down a job offer, not rescind.

Base compensation is a huge factor, but there are many components to \"job satisfaction\" and also the total compensation package.  Here is a short list of things to think about when talking about compensation:  \n\\- Base pay  \n\\- Quarterly/Annual Bonus or Profit Sharing  \n\\- Paid Time Off (PTO)  \n\\- Retirement Program(s) Do they offer a 401k or other program?  Do they do any funds matching?  How much?  \n\\- Health Insurance.  How good are the Health and Dental programs?  How much do they cost per pay period?  Is there an HSA or FSA?  \n\\- Education Reimbursement?  (some companies will pay the tuition for college classes or certificate programs)  \n\\- How likely is it that you will get a raise in the next 12-24 months?  (can check reviews at Glassdoor and similar websites)\n\nOne thing that I always check is how stable is the company?  If it is publicly traded, you can see how Sales/Revenues are doing.  If the company is having financial difficulties, or Sales are stagnate there may be layoffs coming.\n\nYou need to make choices that are best for you.  Having said that, you made a commitment to Company A, so if you flip to Company B some folks will be upset.  That may or may not come back to haunt you later.",

However, I saw my company\u2019s public job posting of a level 1 position (I am level 2) for a salary range higher than I\u2019m currently making even after the two raises. \n\nUsing fake numbers here but for example as a level 2 after two yearly raises I now make 115k, but they listed a level 1 position for 100-120k.\n\nIs this worth brining up to management & asking for more money even though they just gave me the yearly raise of 10k?",

If you worked at the company where I last managed staff, here's how it would work.\n\nI'd get a report each year showing how much each employee made relative to the mid-point for their salary range. In your case, the mid point for level 1 would be $110K. For level 2, it might be $120K. It was easier to give larger raises to people well below mid-point and harder to give raises to people well above mid-point. In fact, being above mid-point and not being promoted was a bad sign for the employee. It was tacitly admitting that they were overpaid but not ready for a promotion.\n\nI found that asking for more money rarely worked. A better conversation was asking your manager about what was expected from someone working at the level above yours. Let them know that you want to work towards that level and want to start taking on the extra responsibilities of someone at that level. It is much easier for your manager to get you a promotion to Level 3 if they have documented evidence that you are working as a Level 3 already. Asking this way shows that you aren't asking for a favor; you're asking for an opportunity.\n\nAt a smaller company that I worked for that was more informal about levels, the only thing that drove pay increases was fear. I knew that budgets were worked on in late October and early November. In early October, I made sure to dress unusually well on some days and take off a couple of extra hours after lunch on those days. I was mimicking the behavior of someone interviewing for roles outside the company. I wanted them to be afraid that I might leave, so that they would budget a pay increase for me. This only works if they don't want to lose you.",

I work Friday dinner, Sat, B-L-D and Sun Breakfast. My last \u201cpermanent\u201d weekend, I was off for a bike race my son and I were in (5/16-5/18) I put in for it about 2 months prior and my manager said there was no problem, she would cover my shifts, which she did, no problem or issues that I know of! \n\nFor the past two weeks, I have been texting my manager to confirm the return to my normal \u201cpermanent\u201d weekend, starting tomorrow at 5:00pm. \n\nI got a text from her today at 5:40pm stating this:\nHey hun- I\u2019m so sorry I\u2019ve been swamped with the order of Malta group this week. \nThe count went down for the group this weekend and I forgot to update you. I don\u2019t have you down but I might be able to put you on for next weekend instead if that works. It\u2019s the Matt women this weekend so you might make more cash next weekend anyway. I am really sorry!\n\nMy reply:\nI completely understand that things get busy \u2014 thank you for letting me know. That said, this is my scheduled weekend to work and I\u2019ve been checking in over the past couple of weeks to confirm- for that reason. I really need the hours and was counting on working this weekend. If there\u2019s any way I can still be put on, even for a couple of shifts, I\u2019d be super grateful. Otherwise, please prioritize me for next weekend. Thank you again.\n\nHer reply:\nHey hun- I do understand and I\u2019m really sorry about that. This weekend was supposed to be a pretty big group but everyday this week the count has gone down which makes things super difficult for me to schedule and I actually have to call another server off now after being updated again. It\u2019s really tough for me to make everything 100 percent fair but I try to do my best. I will definitely check what the count is looking like for next weekend it\u2019s the same pay period if that helps hours wise and hopefully should be decent tip wise also. \n\nI\u2019m floored. I\u2019ve found out from others I work with (my nephew who is a dishwasher) that there are other girls, that are \u201csubs\u201d working all weekend. I need to work, I\u2019ve had this job consistently, for two years, and I love it, and make great money, I can\u2019t give it up, nor do I want to!  \n\nWhat would you do in this situation? This is not sitting right with me, I truly don\u2019t know has something chanced over the course of 3 weekends???? Was I switched to a different weekend? Is this fair? I was counting on the work this weekend to help put food on my table. And she understands and tries to make it fair? Making it fair would be taking a \u201csub\u201d off two or three shifts and letting me work- fair would be cutting the girls from 4 tables to 3, and letting me come work 3 tables also- Fair would be telling me this more than a day before I\u2019m schedule to work for an entire weekend.  Sorry- Rant over \n",

        "text": "Hello! I\u2019m not sure this is the appropriate place to ask, but I would like some advice regarding a situation that\u2019s occurring. I am a substitute yard supervisor at an elementary school. Last week, I got called in for the first time to cover an employee for three days in a row. Quite frankly, the school is incredibly toxic, there was very clear tension between employees, and the kids run the school in all honesty. Furthermore and allegedly, there is a very damaging rumor going around the school and the yard supervisor team that\u2019s causing a lot of damage\n\nDuring those three days, I was trying to do the job I was told to do, which was get the kids sitting while eating. I did that to two particular students, and for one of them, I had to talk/ask a few more times to sit. This happened the following day after, too. Apparently, those two kids complained about me after I did that, which I didn\u2019t care about. \n\nHowever, after that incident of asking them to sit down, I have caught them staring at me. It\u2019s almost like they are watching me because when I catch their eye, they look away and run to the yard supervisor who is creating the damaging rumor I mentioned above. Usually when I look at them and stare back, they look away quickly. \n\nWhen it happened while I was working, I didn\u2019t mind it. However, a family meme bet of mine attends this school. I went to pick them up yesterday and I passed those two students again outside of the school, and the same thing happened. Furthermore, I talked to one of the yard supervisors I worked with last week, and they report that those students have started doing that to them as well. \n\nI understand it\u2019s just staring and kids don\u2019t like to be called out. However, the problems the school had were very noticeable. The last thing I want is for these students to turn things around and get me into any type of trouble. I just did that job for some extra money since I\u2019m still in school. \n\nIf anyone has experienced anything like this, I\u2019d love some advice or any tips you could give me. Thank you. \n\n",

The company has on a few occasions stated that all employees will receive a pay increase but then everything goes quiet for a few months.\n\nI started the job in the support team when it was a team of five, one member left a few months after I had started, and a couple of months ago our most senior member and one of the junior ones were made redundant. The senior member has been described as a maverick, and all of the proprietary product knowledge was stored in his mind. This has left a massive hole in the team and has led to huge work backlogs due to myself and my colleague not being able to carry the workload and resolve complex issues.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that between the two of us, we have around 400 active clients that we are supporting. A single outage, or a dodgy update being pushed to the software by the development team cripples us. We are constantly fighting fires.\n\nWe are salaried workers so we are just expected to keep on top of the workload without additional compensation for working outside of our contracted hours.\n\nWe have been strung along for a few months now with asking to hire some extra support staff, statements such as \u2018we\u2019ll work on getting the job application sent out next week\u2019, this is said every week.\n\nToday some options were sent by HR with an opening statement about the financial struggles the company is experiencing.\n\nVoluntary severance package:\n-Statutory redundancy payment (2 weeks)\n-Payment in lieu of notice period\n-Plus 1 month salary\n-Depart company by end of June\n\nReduced work week\n-reduce to 4 working days with compensation adjusted\n-reduce to 3 working days with compensation adjusted\n-Applied at the beginning of July\n\nI do not believe that the pay rise promised informally will be applied in July, so I feel like I would regret not taking one of the one time offers above. \n\nI believe that the voluntary redundancy is my best option, and anybody I have spoken to believes it\u2019s in my best interest. I feel like compulsory redundancy will be forced on me down the line either way, and it probably won\u2019t come with the extra month of pay. \n\nI have also realised today that after around 6 years in IT support/software support, my salary is only slightly above the current UK minimum wage due to no pay increases. It is a kick in the teeth.\n\nTLDR: I have lost every ounce of joy I had from working in the IT industry, should I take the easy exit and take a hiatus from work for a short while?\n\nBased in the UK, have enough savings to keep my bills paid for the next 6 months. \n\nWould also appreciate any suggestions on industries that my skill set would transfer to.\n\n",

I thought the manager was going to train her at first, but turns out I\u2019m the one who has to do it. But I think she might have some issues that keep her from working properly, and this is my first time working with someone like that \u2014 so I honestly don\u2019t know how to handle it.\n\nAt first, she would scream whenever she got hurt, like getting a paper cut or breaking a nail. She also screams whenever she hears the word \u201cbug\u201d or sees one \u2014 any kind of bug. Everyone was surprised at first, because our firm is usually really quiet. But now, we\u2019ve all kind of gotten used to it. It happens once or twice a week now.\n\nAlso, she doesn\u2019t know how to drive \u2014 and she\u2019s 27 btw. Sometimes, when me and other coworkers try to talk to her, she either responds with loud, random nonsense or ignores us completely. It makes it hard to have a proper conversation. At first, I thought it was just me noticing this, but then other coworkers started bringing it up too \u2014 so I know I\u2019m not imagining it.\n\nShe does a lot of tax return processing, but whenever I check her work, there\u2019s always something wrong. It\u2019s not a big mistake, but it\u2019s the same one she keeps repeating. I tried to ask if it\u2019s too much work for her, but she didn\u2019t answer \ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72. It\u2019s hard to talk to her sometimes because she just ignores everyone. I mean, she\u2019s a really hardworking person. She\u2019s always the first one to arrive at work and always go home late. This might be because she doesn\u2019t have a car and relies on a family member to pick her up.\n\nAll I want is for her to stay calm \u2014 because every time she makes a mistake, she freaks out, and then everything she does afterward goes wrong too. I\u2019ve tried to calm her down by saying things like, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, just take your time, no need to rush,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t seem to help.\n\nOur supervisor is really nice and easygoing, so I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll say anything to her as long as she gets the job done.\n\nSo\u2026 does anyone know how to deal with this?",

My thermostat was adjusted to 75 degrees when I came back in every morning. It didn\u2019t really affect me until this past week.  I have been sweating at my desk with a fan going.  Needing to reapply deodorant two times during the day.  \n\nYesterday I only worked 4 hrs and I reapplied deodorant and then was still extremely stinky when I got home. (Smelled like I had done a several hours long work out at the gym) so when I got to work this morning I turned it down one degree to 74 F.  \n\nBoss comes in at 2:30 asking if I adjusted the thermostats in my office. I said yes.  She goes to adjust it back up telling me to not touch it because her office is cold now.  And she shouldn\u2019t have to wear a sweater.  I reply well I shouldn\u2019t be sitting here at work with no activity sweating my butt off. When I get up and I have put stains and my butt crack sweat is so intense you can see it on my pants and chair it is to hot in here.  I shouldn\u2019t have to reapply deodorant several times a day to maintain hygienic standards. I turned it down one degree. (Which is still warm by southern standards) You can wear a sweater.  \n\nShe stopped and said that\u2019s not normal. I go no it\u2019s not. I shouldn\u2019t have to sweat in the office.  I\u2019d appreciate if I get an exception to uniform policy and can wear a 3/4 sleeve pollo with my tattoos exposed or you leave the thermostat at 74. 75 is to hot.\n\nWhat would you do going forward?

        "text": "For the purposes of not being exposed to possible employees who could see this I will be changing some of my factors I,f(20), want to leave my job,just quit without a 2 weeks, and without any prospects or money saved. For context here is what I am working with. I have worked for a company for four years that is more or less fast food. I am a newly promoted assistant general manager and I am in my 9 month training period. I got promoted back in August and had a 7 week training period and then I got placed at a location with a previously established manager who I am meant to learn under. My training went not so well. The trainer I had did not have a lot of time with me as she also was working on training two others and I fell behind/rushed through my training. After that I was sent to the store I am at now and I had a change in leadership. Now bare with me as I try to get it all out in a way it will make sense. This is my first real job outside of the little side gigs of babysitting during my high school years. So my experience in leading or managing a huge business is little to none. Within the first month of me being there the manager of that store chewed me out for not supporting him in the way he needed support, when neither him nor our manager had a plan as to how I was going to learn more under him. As time passed my manager had meetings with me about how I was not meeting the companies expectations. He drags me about how each time he comes I lack confidence and I don\u2019t act like I\u2019m a manager. Finally after 4 months of this my direct manager talks to me and tells me he dropped the ball on my training and he has no idea how to develop me and that he wants to work on my development. Every time he visits he is quick to point out what I\u2019m doing wrong or how I should be and then told me I would be receiving a corrective action. I worked harder and I tried to take his feedback and turn lemons into lemonade. Yesterday he came to visit and he kept hammering the same things he would say. Finally I had told him I felt like no matter how hard I try he still only points out my flaws and never encourages me for the work I\u2019m doing. He admitted that he was biased about me and that it was something he had to work on and then proceeded to tell me that because I had dropped the ball repeatedly that I would have to work extra hard to earn/change his mind. For more context this job is not a secure position and is the middle period of training until I earn my own store. This is only the tip of iceberg of reasons why I want to leave. This job has ruined me. I have never been one to lack confidence and I\u2019m generally a happy person but lately this job has drained me. It\u2019s hurting not only me but it\u2019s also hurting my relationship with my partner since I come home so drained. It\u2019s taking a huge mental toll on me to say the least. Now to my finances and my plan: My finances: I suck at saving and have no savings and I have a car payment, $400 rent, and credit debt. My plan: (context: I live in Cali) I have 40 hours of vacation time that would get paid to me if I leave and I have a little under 1k in my account. I also have a side hustle that will be bringing in roughly 300 this month.I have a good resume and I\u2019m willing to do any type of retail, waiting, or any work to not have  to go back to my job.  I estimate I could survive a month with the money I would get/have so I can apply and interview. So I guess my question is this: would it be crazy to leave my job for this/is my plan unreasonable? Or am I better off sticking it out until I have something more secure even if it\u2019s draining me?",

        "text": "Please give me your advice.\nFirst of all, I'm so introverted, shy, week, and awkward. Let's get that out of the way. The issue is that we work at a branch with no management, all of them went to the new branch, leaving employees to fight and deal with things themselves. I've worked for a whole year with no office and my name on a waiting list. Finally I was given an office (desk) but I was so fed up that I left the office for few months empty and didn't use it. Then I go sick and stayed at home for few weeks. I got back, went to my desk, left my bag on it and went to my boss. When I returned to my desk I found a new employee on my desk with her name on it and my bag was moved to a random desk, my work pc on the floor and a new pc on the desk! I asked her were you on the waiting list? She said no but this desk was empty and everyone said no one uses it so I took it (with the encouragement of a coworker that i don't get along with), she was embarrassed and removed her name from the desk but I said no no it's OK you can leave it and use the desk The next day I regretted my action and I was so upset so I took her name down, put it on the table, put mine on a different place on the desk. A week passed by, she still used the desk and left when I came back. I felt bad and evil so I told her to put her name again and use the desk as she pleases, she said oh i though you took my name down and put it back. Now, a couple of weeks later, she's insinuating that she wants me to leave the desk! How should I behave now (I don't want to confront her or hurt her)? Note that I am the one who welcomed her and allowed her to use the desk (which I regret deeply).",

        "post-author": "Chuckythedolll",
        "text": "So, my new boss joined a month ago. In the beginning, he was very warm and talkative with me \u2014 we\u2019d chat for a good 1\u20132 hours some days. But suddenly, he\u2019s completely pulled back. He barely acknowledges me now, while he continues being friendly and conversational with the rest of my team.\n\nA bit of background: I transferred internally to this team and was never really welcomed by them. Because of that, I tend to hang out with my old team, where I\u2019m still close with my previous manager of my old team \u2014 he treats me like a younger sister, honestly. Importantly, he also holds a lot of influence in the company and openly supports me, which I truly appreciate. - This is about my Old Manager not New\n\nNow I\u2019m wondering \u2014 is that closeness with my old boss making my new boss uncomfortable? Could it be some sort of power dynamic thing?\n\nThe confusing part is how inconsistent my new boss is. Some mornings, he\u2019s nice to me \u2014 polite, even warm. But by the evening, it\u2019s like a switch flips, and he becomes cold or almost dismissive. And this hot-and-cold behavior seems directed only at me.\n\nOn top of that, I\u2019ve noticed he\u2019ll make these weird comments \u2014 like subtly taunting me, saying things like\u00a0*\u201cYou\u2019re pretending to act dumb\u201d*\u00a0or\u00a0*\u201cThis isn\u2019t really you.\u201d*\u00a0It feels like he\u2019s trying to undermine me or suggest I\u2019m not being genuine.\n\nJust to be clear \u2014 my work is excellent. I\u2019m consistent, I meet deadlines, and I\u2019ve even been recognized for the quality of my work. So I know it\u2019s not a performance issue.\n\nMy team is planning a trip soon, and I chose not to join because I don\u2019t feel comfortable with them. I already feel isolated, and now with my boss acting so unpredictably, it\u2019s getting harder to show up every day with a clear head.\n\nWhat do I do?",

I know I need to quit but I live in NYC and have no money saved. I do freelance work, so I do have some under the table income but that\u2019s about it. \n\nIve already been sending resumes on ZipRecruiter and stuff for a while. And I\u2019ve been quiet quitting for the last few weeks, so I could get fired and go on unemployment while looking for another steady job but I feel like even that is taking too long. Any advice?",

The quote is 40 appointments per month and it's not an impossible number but likely doesn't go higher than that. Most of the apts come from in bound leads but when they aren't flowing I literally just call and call ALL DAY. When I started I had no knowledge of inside sales and the role was explained as administrative work with commission. They also told me l would be on a quota timeline leading up to 20 apts a month as my employment requirements but that turned out not to be true.\nI also deal with a very passive aggressive coworker that handles inside sales for their other regions. I started off with the understanding of handling everything for my state and she handles her state.\nShe's in good with the higher ups and now handles a good 70% of everything. It's honestly much more but I'm tired of trying to defend what I was promised when I signed on.\nI'm just tired of the job and the pay kinda sucks. And sales is kind of cutthroat also. My main issue is just how they SALE you in the interview about quotes and what you are actually doing and getting paid.",

        "text": "I am typically very social/outgoing and like to get to know people in the office. I have this one coworker that is a bit older than me, but we have gotten friendly as we run into each other quite often at work. We've eaten lunch together a couple of times also. But this is not out of the normal on my end, as I also eat lunch with other coworkers on other days.\n\nNow, I am sensing there may be more to it. It started with texts unrelated to work, then compliments on my appearance/outfits, and invites to 1-on-1 plans. I didn't want to read into it too much, however, as these situations could be innocent enough as friendly interactions. But we grabbed lunch again, and they insisted on paying for my meal and the compliments on my looks continued. Something about the overall situation and my recent observations ended up making me feel a little awkward after the lunch. \n\nI don't know how to best navigate from here. I like them as a person, but I have no interest in anything romantic - with them or any coworker. But I don't want to make things weird when it's not like they've done anything untoward. Besides, I'll have to continue seeing this person daily at work so I want to avoid any unnecessary awkward situations. I don't think it's a situation I would report to HR or something. I just don't want to give any mixed signals or encourage anything more than friendly acquaintances. Any advice here on how to handle this tactfully would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\nEDIT: Reworded and made some more clarifications.",

It's more that I'm trying to be cautious of encouraging any unintended mixed signals. It does make me a little uncomfortable that they keep commenting on how pretty I am and how good I look, as we work in a corporate office setting, and I would rather be reflected on my work and professionalism. I do take pride in how I present myself but I dress conservatively at work, if that matters to anyone. But there have been a few comments that I felt were flirty in nature. They are also a bit older than I am, which may add to my hesitance. And yes, they keep inviting me to 1-on-1 plans after work, though I've always declined. I don't know if I would be giving any wrong ideas if I continue to be \"friendly\" in the office, but I also don't think what's happended so far is enough reason to make me shut them out cold at this moment.",

Generally it\u2019s good to go to get to know your coworkers outside of work. The lunches where it\u2019s just the 2 of you, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a red flag necessarily, I\u2019m male and I\u2019ve had plenty of platonic friendships with female coworkers and we\u2019d grab lunch just the 2 of us without any issues. But obviously go with your gut on that one, case by case scenario and dependent on his behavior obviously. \n\nI\u2019m not a fan of complimenting people on their looks at work either. Unless it\u2019s something they kind of initiate (if somebody asked me how they looked or something, which has happened before). So I\u2019m with you here, but I also feel this doesn\u2019t have to be a red flag either, it can definitely be done tastefully and could also be innocent - maybe as friends to cheer somebody up. Even if it\u2019s a bit flirty it just can\u2019t go overboard, every office has a few flirts male or female. I think a good way to set your boundaries here if you\u2019re looking to limit this, keep it short in your responses and then move quickly to the next topic, if you can go directly to a work topic that\u2019s even better. And generally I don\u2019t feel there\u2019s anything wrong with being friendly but firm in your boundaries, but again this is based on your gut feeling.",

I\u2019ve only had one shift so far and I\u2019m supposed to have two more this week, one them being Sunday. This is where the problem begins: on top of all this I am moving to a new apartment with my boyfriend (27m) of 2 years. Currently we\u2019re staying at each other\u2019s parents house as they live in the town we\u2019re moving to and our old apartment is an hour and a half away. We were supposed to move on Saturday, which I requested off, but I had an unexpected death in the family and the funeral is on Saturday now so our plans shifted. We discussed moving stuff Sunday and then I got scheduled to work. I told my boyfriend I could help a little before going to work, but he thinks I should put up the shift because it\u2019s \u201ca small concession job.\u201d This is true but I feel that it would be a bad look because I just got this job. While this is not a full time career, it\u2019s still a job and I don\u2019t want a bad look. Putting up the shift would be easy, it also isn\u2019t guaranteed that anyone will take it then I would have to work. I also plan on moving some things Friday when I\u2019m off work.

On your resume, you could say, \u201cStarted on [date] as an entry-level employee, left on [date] as a manager.\u201d That shows growth, initiative, and responsibility\u2014even if it was short-term.\n\nOr if the job\u2019s really boring or doesn\u2019t pay enough, spend that downtime looking for something better\u2014something more engaging and that actually pays what you\u2019re worth.\n\nThing is, companies these days aren\u2019t loyal like they used to be. Back in the day, people got pensions, stayed with the same company until retirement. My grandpa used to get paid a normal wage just for having holidays off. And folks who actually worked the holiday got time and a half. Stuff like that doesn\u2019t exist much anymore.\n\nSo yeah, move forward. Don\u2019t get stuck.\n\nIf it\u2019s not about the money, fair enough\u2014that\u2019s a valid point. But real talk? Money does matter. Not for status, who cares about that\u2014but for security. You should always have some saved in a high-interest savings account.

I've worked buyer side and now publisher side. I find the concept and workings of the industry advanced. Too tech-y. I also really dislike it. \n\nSo much data, excel sheets. I'm not interested in learning more. I have a great workplace and boss etc. \n\nMy manager is really smart. In this industry I feel like everyone is, and I'm just guessing. The jargon and concepts are doing my head in: CPMs, DSP/SSPs, auctions, fixed rate, waterfalls, media vendors/clients, agencies etc...\n\nI've jumped roles and different companies several times over the years. I'm feeling mentally exhausted and just over it. I'm planning on resigning really soon without another job lined up. It's not even the workload. I am absolutely struggling now to even complete one task. Huge mental block. I can't focus at all.\n\nI've noticed I can't absorb information lately and can't connect the dots of things I could do before regarding work stuff. \n\nI do sleep/revenge procrastination a lot too because I don't want work to arrive again the next day so it's just me psychologically delaying the inevitable.\n\nI've resigned without a new job lined up before (twice) and it was fine (but maybe just lucky and fortunate, I know). I ended up getting something. I'm always seen as a great worker. I've received a couple of internal awards too in the past.\n\nMy average tenure at each company ranges from 7 months to 4 yrs.\n\nI want a break to re-evaluate what I want to do. Even if I get desperate for cash, I'm willing to find a retail job like I did in my uni/college days so I can be in a more basic mindset and not think in this level of detail. But I'm just over ALL media.\n\nAnyone ever been in this boat?\n\nTL;DR - I'm over working in media ops and will resign soon without another job lined up. Mentally over it.\n",

        "text": "So here's the deal. I've been working for my father for about... 20 years, I work hard and show up every day on time always. \n\nThe last few years or so he's always been late on paying me. Like every 4-5 weeks he misses a week, so gets a week behind, but usually gets me caught up \n\nOver the last 2 years he has been being, constantly. I get behind, so far this year since January he's roughly 5 weeks behind. I kind of wrote off last year (2024). \n\nSo after missing another week's pay I told him I wasn't interested in working until he gets my pay. Does this sound unreasonable? I just feel like he doesn't take it seriously, that since I save money and don't live paycheck to paycheck then it's acceptable, but whenever he has a slight surplus of money he splurges on things, this I can see, and who am I to tell him what to do, it's not my business, as long as I am paid. \n\nIn the past work was busier, and there were more employees and he would make more money, and now it's just me. (It's a trade/service business). So I feel he has high expenses, etc that I'd hard to sustain with just 1 employee... Let's face it I can only do so much work, so there is a limit to what he can make off of me. \n\nAlso there's a few customers he complains about constantly not wanting to pay when they are supposed to, or not wanting to pay market value, this irritates me even more when I'm told to go do work there knowing later I'm going to be told my pay isn't there because the customer isn't following through. I'd rather take unpaid time off, then have to listen to that. \n\nSo does it seem unreasonable for me to tell him I'm not interested in working until he has some pay for me? It's not as if I'm paid peace work or a % of the job and we have an agreement that I get paid when my share of the job comes in or whatever. \n",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\nI'm an international student in the UK, and I currently work as a **support worker**. I\u2019m allowed to work **up to 20 hours a week** during term time and **full-time during holidays** (which is coming up in two weeks for me).\n\nThe issue is that I originally applied for a **part-time position**, and even during the holiday periods (like Christmas and Easter), I was never given more than **16 hours per week**. Sometimes I\u2019ve had weeks with **zero hours** because the people I support were away or unavailable, which meant **no income at all**. This happened recently for the past two weeks I didn\u2019t get any shifts and made no money.\n\nMy manager is actually very kind and supportive, and he knows I can work more during the upcoming break. But he told me that because I applied as a part-time worker, he **can\u2019t guarantee more than 16 hours per week**, even during holidays. I really need more hours and more stable income right now, especially with summer break coming.\n\nTomorrow I\u2019ll be meeting him again, and I\u2019ll also be introduced to new people I might support. I feel bad, but I want to tell him that if he can\u2019t give me **at least 16 hours per week every week for the next month**, I might have to **start looking for another job** where I can get more consistent hours (closer to 20, or even full-time during holidays). I feel super guilty because he\u2019s a nice guy, and I like the job, but financially it\u2019s not working for me right now.\n\nI want to be respectful and not sound ungrateful. Any advice on **how to say this to him** face-to-face tomorrow? Or if you\u2019ve been in a similar situation, how did you handle it?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n(I just feel so guilty especially because I had like no experience when he took me because nowadays no one wants someone without experience.....)\n\n",

I really enjoy working here and I\u2019m grateful you gave me a chance, especially when I didn\u2019t have much experience.\n\nWith the summer break coming up, I wanted to ask if there\u2019s any way I could consistently get more hours\u2014closer to 16 or even full-time while it\u2019s allowed. I\u2019ve been struggling financially, and having no shifts some weeks has made things tough.\n\nI completely understand if things are limited on your end, but if it looks like there won\u2019t be enough work available, I might have to start looking at other jobs just to stay afloat. I just wanted to be upfront and respectful about it.

When you receive critique from your leader, you could mentally just keep time (if you know there's nothing you can do on a case-by-case basis to alleviate the critiques), or drive deeper into how to resolve what the stumbling blocks are.\n\nWhile your supervisor is a micromanager, constructive engagement might help. Don't be desperate or panicky, but relax into your long tenure of success. Don't lose your confidence\u2014you know what you've been capable of doing, and how you've succeeded. Has your supervisor ever been a supervisor before? Perhaps the discussion can include something like, \"While I've written productive emails with this company for XX years, I see that you have identified an area that you'd like for me to approach differently. What is your leadership objective here, and is there an over-arching approach that I can keep in mind?\" Or how about, \"I see that you're looking for ways to help me improve as an employee. Here are some areas I'm interested in developing.\" While this might just give your supervisor something more to pile on, it might also provide a something for your supervisor to focus on instead, and in the process get you some development you might be interested in. (I realize I'm being very generous regarding the character of someone who could be toxic, immature, and predatory.)\n\nMeanwhile, document everything, including your emails and your supervisor's replies\u2014physical copies that go into your bag and go home with you at the end of every day (as well as the interactions above). After a few weeks, consult a labor attorney on your options while reviewing the copies and your notes. You'll want to have someone in your corner to protect you if it comes to it.\n\nKeep looking for another position. If you can hang in there, I'd recommend waiting until you have the new position. I also recommend if possible that when you accept the new position, you give yourself the one pay-period's notice at your current job, plus a week or two vacation between jobs to decompress.

        "text": "So, I, 26f, am a service technician at a dealership. I got hired in for 4$ less than the guy they hires after me, and 5$ an hour less than the guy they hired before me. Neither of the guys were brand certified, and neither of them turn as many hours as I do or have the familiarity with the brand as I do. More recently, both of these guys have been having comeback cars and not performing the repairs they diagnosed. \n\nMy boss has been making me clean up their mess; he was friends with both of these guys before they came to work for him. Pay style is flat rate, so im losing money taking their work when I have my own I need to do. They got the easy work out of the cars, and I have to do the diagnostics that dont pay out because its warranty work. Same with the engine job my coworker diagnosed. Now im replacing it because he wont. \n\nThey just gave me a raise recently, but it still does not put me on par with the other two guys. I still make 2 and 3$ less than they do. They didnt tell me their pay, but I stumbled upon it accidently while looking at my warranty numbers a while back, before I asked for the raise.\n\nDo I move on and go somewhere else because theyre taking advantage of me? Or do I give them the chance to pay me properly? I average higher hours turned than both of them, and I have a broader scope than both of them, working on both ev and gasoline vehicles within my brand, including internal ev battery diagnostics, which no one else in my shop is certified to do, so i could find another job. But im struggling to find a reason to stay here aside from the fact that i picked up and moved here last year to a state I dont have friends or family in. \n\nIve had issues with this boss on and off because he thinks he knows more than he does, tries to walk all over me because he thinks women cant hurt him and wont stop him, and because its his way or the highway. He told me as far as he was concerned im \"locked in\" and even if he wanted to he couldnt get rid of me, so that makes me think there is room to get them to match my coworkers pay. What's my best move?",

Technically, we are supposed to be certified in high voltage to even touch hybrids and ev vehicles, certified in power train to do engines and transmission replacements, electrical and comms for diag... etc. But as my boss says, \"theres ways around it.\" Idk what happens when they screw up, but I know that it always ends up having to be taken over by a certified tech, usually me or my foreman. But my foreman is talking about leaving which as selfish as it sounds, puts me in a rough position anyway. But I respect it if its time for him to go. They hire techs who are already brand certified so they dont have to pay the cost of getting us trained themselves, so while we come at a higher hourly rate, we only get paid on work we complete.",

If more information is needed, we know where to turn.  The answers we are often looking for have been answered in our hearts, but we are simply seeking confidence in that decision.  The bottom line, OP is that you know what you need to do.  You are very clear, and  not thinking emotionally, but with facts.  That is the foundation of a good decision\u2026 facts and not feelings.  YOU DO GOT THIS!!  Trust your gut and write the FACTS out so that you are more clear and thus more able to inform others as you have the coming discussion.

Don\u2019t just do the work, do it eagerly and without complaint.  There\u2019s a great chance, given several factors, including your relatively young age, emotional frustration and associated experience, that your perspective may be skewed just a bit - over-inflating/underestimating the differences between you & your co-workers who are paid slightly more.  There\u2019s a lot that goes into pay, especially in skilled labor and people are rarely are paid the same because skill is subjective.\n\nBut, business owners care about one thing - making money.  If you become objectively more productive/efficient, you are more valuable to them and you will be paid accordingly.\n What you need to do is double down and objectively demonstrate  excellence:  your superior skill, attitude, work ethic and value to the company over everyone else.  Get there earlier, stay longer, produce more, do whatever you are asked to do willingly and better than anyone else there - take initiative to take on more/new jobs.  You will become invaluable, and you can demand more pay commensurate to your value.\n\nLife isn\u2019t fair, never will be and doesn\u2019t have to be.  But, you can determine how you respond to it.  Learn and understand the game you must play, then out work everyone else and become invaluable until you can write your own ticket.  Complaining is never the best answer, especially in the work place.  It may make you feel better, or give you a sense of cosmic justice/validate your feelings, but it\u2019s counterproductive.\n\nI wish you good luck!",

There are many guests who also are muslim and minors who come for services, who could feel very uncomfortable put in this situation. Many women feel comfortable changing near the lockers as it is faster because there is only three stalls (shower, changing, bathroom).

My stepdad was a tattoo artist and also a bit of an asshole.  Before I was even legally an adult I had a bunch of HIGHLY offensive tattoos who's meanings I didn't understand.  \n\nWith the warm weather coming, people are wearing shorts and short sleave shirts at work.  Those would expose my tattoos, which I worry could be offensive.  \n\nI've already lost one account from this.  We have a client who likes to conduct business over pickle ball.  When my boss discovered what my tattoos were they gave someone else the assignment because they worried about the client's reaction.  \n\nI'm wondering how I should handle this.  Should I just wear suits to work?  That would give me a certain kind of reputation and make me stick out.  Should I go to a laser tattoo removal place?  That would annihilate my savings when I'm trying to save for a kid.  Should I have the tattoos covered up with less offensive (but bigger) ones?  That would make it harder to ever have them completely removed with lasers.  (It's easiest to cover up a tattoo with something bigger and darker.)  ",

If you're worried about spending money you would save for a kid, think of how hard it's going to be to explain to a kid what they mean and why they should think less of anyone who has tattoos like that while also still respecting you as a parent. And then go spend the money.\n\n2- They cannot be covered up or lasered instantly, so you have to figure out what to do about them. You've already lost work because of them, so continuing to wear shorts and short sleeves is not an option. Suits are not the only long-pants-long-sleeve outfit in existence.

You might want to think of tattoo removal as an investment in your kid because unless you are very lucky after having a kid you are not going to be any more able to save for tattoo removal after, and probably far more desperate to do something about it before you have to start explaining to your kid, their teachers, their friends, their friends parents, etc... about your offensive tattoos which will inevitably be seen or heard about once the rumor mill gets cranking.",

Asking for one day off is different from a month's worth of limited availability. It's not surprising that it would be an issue for them to do without one of their regular employees one day every weekend for a month.\n\nI'm not saying that she can't ask for it, but that's probably why it's an issue for them. You have made a commitment to them to work on weekends, and they count on that. They will have to figure out how to cover for you or do without you  every weekend for a month. Again, you can definitely change your availability, but it sounds more like you are trying to take a bunch of time off, rather than changing your availability. Since it's only for a month, they can't just replace you for those shifts, because you are going to be expecting it after the month.  Just take off whatever time you need, but consider that they rely on you, and know that if your limited availability becomes an issue, they may fire you, and you most likely not be eligible for unemployment because of your seriously limited availability.",

Recently the owner stopped by and told me the store was the most disorganized, filthy and disgusting store he\u2019s ever visited and if I don\u2019t fix it he\u2019ll fire me on the spot the next time he comes in. Not going to lie to a soul, I cried. The store hasn\u2019t changed and my standards are high for store cleanliness. The only thing he point out as dirty was the floor and we just got our monthly dry goods order, so there was boxes everywhere and empty shelves.\n\nWell, I talked about the visit with my RM, trainers, etc. They all told me he\u2019s just like that sometimes and now to worry about it, he was just stressed out due to the dry goods order.\n\nWell today I receive an email from HR stating my management title has been stripped until the store is fixed. However, outside of dirty floors no one has told me what else was so wrong and needs to be fixed? At this time I am not getting a pay cut, but I feel like they just have me grasping at straws on what is so disgusting about my store.\n\nI\u2019m trying really hard not to get bent out of shape of be petty about it, but I\u2019m honestly thinking about letting the store fall to shit and just get a new job.",

Respond to the email and say that you are confused as to how they expect you to correct it if you\u2019re no longer the manager, and then start applying to other jobs. Ultimately you\u2019re going to have to leave, because there\u2019s no coming back from this. Your owner is an unprofessional asshole but now that he has this negative opinion of you and your work, you will never succeed in that company. \n\nYour above store leaders should have protected you. I\u2019ve had higher ups such as franchise owners or corporate representatives come into stores and throw their weight around, but when my store managers called and told me how they were being bullied, I immediately stepped in and told these people that it was my area/market, if they had problems with how I ran it they could talk to me, but ultimately my store managers were acting on my guidance so leave them out of it. If you worked for me, one of two things would have happened: Either nothing would have happened and the owner would have treated you with respect in the future, or he could enjoy running both your store and the entire market because I\u2019d be going somewhere else if he didn\u2019t trust me to do my job.",

I started getting it back to where it should be.. it took a long time, but i got it there. I remember the vice president of the company came in. He said that the store looked great and was very happy with progress. But also said since its looking so much better, hes Gunna get a little nit picky so we can get it even better.. i was fine with that. He gave me a small list (things like floors underneath our shake machine, legs and wheels on our shelves and equipment, etc) but had he just said \"store looks great, but u still have work to do\" than just left without telling me what i should be attacking, id be pissed. All that does it set someone up to fail! If u really love ur job and dont want to leave, this is what id do : make urself a list of what can be cleaned (walls, shelves, floors, carpets, stainless steel polishing equipment, wheels, floor boards, anything) and take before and after photos of everything u cleaned. That way when he comes back, if he says u didn't do what he asked u can pull out the list and photos and say that he gave u zero instructions so u just started cleaning whatever looked like was needed and than ask for specifics. If the job doesn't mean that much to u, just start looking for something else cuz imo, what the owner did was disrespectful and ungrateful. I get very stressed as the one in charge of my store, but i refuse to ever take that out on my staff. It's not fair. At least u have time to really sit n think about what u want to do. Also, why is it all falling on just u???",

They set the example.\n\nAnd guess who they fired for not following another policy?  Why it was me!  Because they sent me home to change, so I did that.  Came back 45 min later.  And the next week?

        "text": "Hello! \n\nThrowaway account because I don't want my coworkers to accidentally stumble on to this post through my main. \n\nBut I've been with this company for a few years and during that time I've never complained, been late meeting my deadlines or had any issues/negative feedback on my work performance. Now I've been on sick leave for two months due to burn out caused by issues I've been having with my manager. I still haven't told him why I'm on sick leave and he seems to think it's due to work responsibilities which it never was, I did tell him that's not the reason but didn't clarify the issues I have with him. I've been meaning to have that conversation with him+HR when my sick leaves ends because I want to be in a better state of mind.\n\nNow fast forward and I have a call with him, in which he just wants to see how I'm doing etc. But then he brings up the fact that a lot of things have changed and he \"doesn't know if the company or the team is the right fit for me since he doesn't want me too feel poorly\" that's a direct quote. Now I'm spiraling that they're going to let me go/try to push me out. Of course I won't be resigning they'll have to fire me so I can get my severenge package but I feel like if I don't come back soon it'll be too late. Now I don't know what to do, I need a job otherwise I won't be able to keep my apartment and will need to move back home which I really don't want to as I love the city I'm living in. Anyone been in the same position who have some solid advice? \n\nAlso to clarify I did speak to my union and sadly where I am they're allowed to fire someone who's on sick leave due to stress... But they did tell me they need a reason for it and if they can't justify then I might have a case, since nothing has happened yet I can't say much more about it.",

Let me give some backstory, so on 5/23 I had work at my other job and since i work at a mall i was able to go around and get some birthday freebies and when i was on my way to sephora i went past my other job and my manager saw me and wished me a happy birthday. I was feeling okay at that time and not sick so she saw me being all happy and excited for my birthday. It wasn\u2019t till after i got home from work that i started feeling really sick and i ended up throwing up my lunch. As the day went by i just kept on getting worse and worse and by the next morning (5/24) I was having full on flu symptoms so I decided to call the store to let my manager know that i\u2019m not feeling good and that I\u2019m most likely not going to be able to make it into my shift for tomorrow (5/25). To which she answered the phone and said \u201ci saw you yesterday and you looked fine so don\u2019t lie, you can\u2019t call out of your shift because you\u2019re hungover\u201d and she wouldn\u2019t even let me get a word in without her saying \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go it\u2019s busy and I\u2019m not granting you sick time unless you have a doctors note bye\u201d and that\u2019s how the conversation ended. And i\u2019m just thinking to myself like fuck i wish i was hungover cause i would\u2019ve actually partied for my birthday instead of being on my deathbed \ud83d\ude2d. I just feel so disrespected and it doesn\u2019t help that it\u2019s my birthday weekend and it got ruined because of how sick i am :,). So i just need advice on how I should go about this because a big part of me wants to report her and quit but she is like a friend to me outside of work so it sucks :/. ",

        "text": "Tomorrow I return to work after a month off of medical leave for \"burnout\"\u2013which I put in quotes because it very much was but I am also in treatment for depression and this is what my psychiatrist wrote my diagnosis as since my untenable workload, nonstop stress, long hours and despite made me utterly collapse. I have spent the last month on increased meds, walking daily, making sure to get sleep, spending a lot of quiet restorative time, to begin to feel ok again.\n\nI work remotely, in a small studio where we are all essentially equals, but where some people have a lot more years at the company. It is by its nature a pressure cooker environment and we are understaffed, and above all we have a couple difficult personalities, including my closest collaborator who is good at turning the thumbscrews. I am not at all convinced this is going to be a good dynamic for me to try to endure in the long run but I am going to give it another try, being more aware of my limits and the pitfalls, if somewhat more vulnerable.\n\nI am going to try to establish some boundaries both for myself and with my colleagues to try to preserve my wellbeing. I wonder if you have any advice or direct experience? \n\nWhat I've been thinking:\n\nI'm going to turn off distracting notifications (our chat) and check email hourly in order to preserve my focus. (Based on reading Cal Newton's Deep Work while I was gone. I also read Essenrialism and The Cure for Burnout, all three of which were helpful.) I'm going to try to get the handle of time blocking.\n\nI'm going to use a time tracker AND ALSO work exactly 40hrs, and only during working hours. The rest of my work that can't get done in that time...oh well, that's a company problem.\n\nI am going to try to quantify exactly the kinds and number of projects I will agree to work on. I'm a little nervous that I haven't nailed this down yet.\n\nIm going to take a full lunch break, disconnecting.\n\nI'm considering having some stock replies when meetings get heated (usually passive aggression or double standards/complaints from some usual culprits). I haven't figured out what that is yet. Any ideas? \n\nI'm also considering having some stock replies when my colleague twists thumb screws, like \"That's not going to be feasible,\" when he tries to propose an unrealistic deadline or \"I want to underline my objection here,\" as necessary.\n\nFor myself, I'm going to keep sleeping well, taking time to do NOT work things, and reminding myself that I deserve to have comfort and joy and interests outside of work, that I do not need to feel like I work in the mines. \n\nAny other advice for protecting myself and my poor battered nervous system?",

        "text": "At the title suggests, I just started working a New job after being unemployed for almost 5 years. I love my job and  the people that I work with. I'm restarting life all over again and Since I started Working I've been giving 100%. \nI don't have a car so I sometimes have to walk 8 miles from my house to the job or I take the bus. \nIt's only a part-time job but I want to be responsible and take care of this job and last longer than a year which I've never Done !\n\nI don't know what happened but Recently Without warning I was let Go Early at least an hour before my shift ended. And today as soon as the schedule was created I Found Out that my boss only gave me two work days this whole week. After asking her about it she had nothing but a weak excuse. I called hours later to check up on the situation and she Came clean saying that there have been managers complaining about me on my work productivity, saying that I take long bathroom breaks and and spreading lies such as laziness or inefficient work productivity.\n I became very angry but kept my composure and spoke to her in a professional manner but told her to tell me exactly the names so I can speak to them face to face because I said it was very disrespectful for them to go behind my back but then be nice to my face which makes them a two-face. I will come clean and say that my Work productivity has suffered a bit because after walking 8 miles to work I'm very tired and my energy is low. But being falsely accused of being lazy and not giving it 100% is a great offense to me. I told my manager that I love and care about my job otherwise I wouldn't be willing to walk 8 miles to it.  I know that's not her problem and I feel bad for complaining because there are other employees with less hours than mine but it still bothers me. I told her that if she is unwilling to give me hours that's perfectly fine. But that it's cruel to have other employees and managers talk behind my back that I cannot stand for. My manager changed her tone and said she would be willing to give me hours but at this point I don't care anymore because I'm so hurt, disappointed and so angry and resentful of the employees talking about me behind my back that I don't really care about the job too much anymore I'm just so angry.\n\nMy first thought was to not say anything and just keep working but I take this very personal.  I don't want to quit but I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and I resent the job and all the employees there I don't hate them but I'm angry and I don't know what to do anymore.",

        "post-author": "Alibear22",
        "text": "So yesterday my boss called me in the office and had a talk with me, he said that I call out every single Monday and that he believes that I'm either partying too much and too hungover to come to work, having boyfriend problems, or have depression. Mind you I have called out 3 times spread out over 7 months because I was sick. COVID one time, general flu another and one I just needed a mental health day but that's valid.\nI was late twice because my cat was throwing up and I'm not just going to leave puke everywhere, I had to clean it. He said he's never heard of a cat throwing up which like.... That's kind of what they do.\nSo basically he backed me into a corner demanding another explanation so I said it's the end of the school year (I work at a school but not for the school) and that maybe burnout is setting in but that has nothing to do with anything.\nHe says that he doesn't even believe that and he's never had burn out before so I'm obviously lying. Then he proceeds to say that I need to learn how to be honest with myself and if I can't do that how can I even be honest with him and they're looking to lay people off so if I want my job I need to really consider everything he's saying.\nI don't know what it is about my looks or what but I feel very discriminated against, he just called me a drunk party girl with boy issues and depression, oh and a liar. It almost feels like he's trying to push me to quit so he doesnt have to fire me especially since my review is coming up and im entitled to a raise.\nHe's completely happy with my performance and said I'm a great worker though.\n\nSo is he really allowed to 1 say those things, and 2 use that a grounds to fire me?",

Joe, to recap today\u2019s conversation, you called me into the office to inform me that you didn\u2019t believe I was sick when I used sick days on Mondays. You informed me that you believed I was lying and either hungover or had boyfriend issues. You asked why I was really out and when I explained my illness you said I was lying and you wanted a better explanation. Not knowing what to say and feeling pressure I responded that maybe it was burnout. You said since you don\u2019t get burnout then I don\u2019t get burnout and that I was still lying. You said I had to think it over and as you were looking to lay people off my job is in jeopardy. You reiterated that this was not about my work performance, as I am a great worker. You then ended the meeting.  Thank you for the feedback. I will take it under advisement. \n\nThe fact that your boss brought up potential boyfriend issues is suspect. \n\nDocument everything!!!\n\n\nIt\u2019s factual and unemotional.  Save all emails and responses.",

The boss even indicated that he hated working with a f-bomb and wanted to get rid of him. He got a very nice six figure settlement.\n2. A Black man quit an assembly job at a famous EV carmaker headed by a South African idiot because he was able to prove that he was being verbally harassed and bullied by a bigoted supervisor with complete knowledge of the employer (other managers and personnel) who did nothing to stop the abuse. Frequent use of the N-word and racial insults created a hostile workplace. Again, nice six figure settlement.",

If you do an at home one, take a picture of it (preferably with something showing the date/your name such as a piece of mail so they can\u2019t accuse you of faking the picture.) I realize not everyone can afford a doctor, but if you can, get a doctor\u2019s note. By her own admission one was a mental health day. I get it, we all feel burned out. But particularly if it was a Monday in a pattern of calling off on Mondays, it is not a good look. \n\nIf the times she is absent always happen to be Mondays, her boss is reasonable to be suspicious. Of course it happens, but Monday/Friday absences as a pattern are going to raise red flags. And if you\u2019re at a school, those are the hardest days to find subs or cover whatever the missing work is. Now add the tardiness to that. It sucks your cat throws up, but if it\u2019s happening multiple times you need a different game plan. (OP you, not person I\u2019m replying to). I manage our paraprofessional schedule and if I have someone who is chronically late, that is a conversation. Even if they appear to have valid reasons for tardiness, once a pattern is established they need to start getting a different routine that lets them get to school on time. \n\nThe biggest red flag is the reference to being a drunk party girl. That sounds like it is bordering on possible sex discrimination and could be an HR issue. OP needs to be honest with herself about her attendance record. Is the boss really overreacting, or does she have an established pattern of absences/tardiness, particularly on Mondays which would make any reasonable person suspicious?",

To me, it sounds like the manager was leading OP into giving reasons for firing them, since they\u2019re looking to cut staff.",

You're not throwing up at work, you're not bringing alcohol or anything else to work. Can HR clarify if there is an issue with the number of sick says you've taken or documentation provided? You're not required to show documentation until 3 days, but would it help HR if you provided some now?\n\nTake what works for you, leave the rest.",

BUT the OP said they called out 3 times in 7 months! Not frequently enough to be a pattern per say. The late for work thing is suspicious, for cat puke, but it CAN be some work especially for carpet. But there are things people can do for their cats to reduce hairballs or upset stomachs that she should look into. \n\nBut the fact that you think 3 call outs and 2 tardies is reprehensible OR that it means she doesnt respect her employment enough is frankly pompous!",

He has also mentioned she does good work and is providing to her a bit of insight as to the companies near future intentions. I would take this as a simple heads up warning. But then again, I am a bit old school and way less sensitive than today\u2019s society. I do believe that if one is willing (which most aren\u2019t) to look at themselves with complete honesty, they will find some truth in the criticism from others, even if to a small degree. But, I know, not in today\u2019s society of \u201cit\u2019s not my fault\u201d. I find it funny that you so willingly take one side to heart as truth. Look at both sides of a possible truth in the middle\u2026\u2026.And, I do feel that kind of absence and tardiness is suspect in your first seven months of employment. Again, old school, I go to work with an upset belly, or even though I don\u2019t want to. Burnout? The company and your co-workers need to pick up your slack because you don\u2019t feel like going to work? BS",

What's the point of hearing someones story if you automatically have bias in your ears? \n\nYeah there is a lot of people who dont value the job above themselves or their life -- work ethic is important but WORK is not the end all be all. There should be a line of priority towards ourselves, because at the end of the day the job does NOT take care of us, WE DO. If we get burnout we dont do our job well AND we get more frustrated at work and make the workplace worse. I get annoyed when I know a coworker doesnt consider the team at all but if I know a coworker is sick and came in I'm more annoyed. If someone has burnout, then something needs to change and they need a short break. A tummy ache is not the same thing as being sick, but my supervisor sent me home once because my stomach was hurting So Bad I could barely move or breathe (turned out to be from expired protein powder in my smoothie). Thats how someone who cares about PEOPLE and not the JOB takes care of the TEAM. I HAVE picked up the slack when people are out and I wasnt mad because our team is strong enough to handle it and it lets me feel comfortable taking time when I need it - that's literally how teams work. They're as strong as their weakest link, so if one person calling out 3 times kills production, that's a weak ass team.",

Whether or not 3 absences in 7 months is \"frequent\" or a pattern, his actions were textbook discriminatory harassment.

I can tell from her explanations for why she missed work, and why she was late, that I would have the same assumptions about her (not that shes a party girl, or heart broken, but that she doesn't take the job seriously and doesn't care too much about it). From her own words, to me it seems she doesn't take her job as seriously as she is expected to, and is upset that her boss has high expectations of her. If her boss said those things, the way she's portraying them, he could have done it a lot more tactfully but it sounds like her boss is kind of an idiot and is looking out for her in his own little dumb way. She feels that if she can call him out for discrimination and get others to agree, she can discount what he's telling her and she's free of all blame in this situation. She will continue to think that she isn't doing anything wrong, and when she loses this job, and is shocked, she will wonder why. Then she will get another job and not have grown at all. And the cycle will repeat it's self. I think they are both to blame and need to take accountability. Her for not taking her job seriously and not self reflecting when she's been called out. Him for how he speaks to people and how he gets information out. Because I can tell you, even if I think you're a vapid love sick party girl, I would NEVER say that to you as an employee of mine.\n\nBut I know, I know, she didn't do anything wrong, and she should record every interaction they have, and get a lawyer, and blast him on social media for being a sexist, and form a workplace union and go on strike, and call the police and every other thing people tell others to do on reddit any time someone says something you don't like lol",

Mean is a childish way to put it so I phrased it as unprofessional and biased. How is telling someone to their face that they must be lying about getting sick and they must just be irresponsible partiers NOT discrimination and bias?? To assume that the op absolutely is lying and the boss DIDNT say that OR that its reasonable for him to treat her that way IS to read the story with bias to doubt her words to the point of denying everything she claims.

The boss handled it completely wrong, but it sounds like he is trying to get her to realize what it may appear to those who do not know her and are in charge of the mentioned layoffs.

Her for being less reliable than others on her team and him for being \u201coffensive\u201d to someone of today\u2019s sensitive society.",

I had a previous employer who started making an issue out of workers (not me specifically) being out too many Fridays; after that, I just generally tried to randomize my mental health days. Or, when I was really sick and needed a down day but would probably have to just power through the rest, I\u2019d just pick a different day of the week to call out\u2014which was stupid on my employer\u2019s part, because if workers could have been home sick for 3 days, they generally would have been more recovered before returning to work and thus less likely to be at work unhealthy and possibly getting coworkers sick.",

You could have cancer and be out for 4 months of treatment...if the office can't do without you they'll have to hire someone else.  You don't get to make your problem their problem.\n\nThis is not my opinion nor do I agree with it, I am just stating the facts of the workplace.\n\nImagine an office of 6 people working hard all day.  Suddenly four of them each need 2 months off for medical treatments or medical travel or long covid or mental health care etc.  The office will not be able to continue without hiring new people, it's just a fact.    If you can't show up for work, they can replace you, it would be nice if they just hired some temporary people to take your place but that's not always possible and there is no law saying the employer must be compassionate.\n\nHonestly what you describe in your OP doesn't sound to me like your boss wants you gone, it sounds like he's dealt with a lot of people who are out too much and thinks he just has another one on his hands.  (I don't agree with him that 3 times in 7 months is excessive though.  If he's happy with you otherwise he should let a couple of lates just slide.  A good boss knows that if they let someone like you go they could end up with someone much worse.  I dunno, maybe you could get that point across to him? Talk about your good points when he mentions what he doesn't like).",

The first time I was fired, they called me to tell me I had used too many absences in a row and they would not approve that. I was in the hospital because I had a UTI that went undetected for so long I developed a kidney infection and a renal abscess. They simply did not care. The second time I lost my job, I had applied for ADA accomodations for developing complications from my disabilities. When the accomodations were requested and explained for by my doctors, corporate called me to tell me that they agreed with my doctor's assessment that I needed the accomodations. However, she went in to say \"since you are acknowledged by our company to be disabled, it means you are *incompatible with employment* and we must terminate you immediately., with prejudice.\" \n\nI'm telling you all this to explain that bosses and corporations don't care about you, your health, or your reasons for missing work (even just being late). It doesn't matter if you have the best, most logical, and most obvious reasons for not being there. *They simply don't care*. You can and will lose your job and nothing will fix that damage because the situation is stacked in the uncaring corporation's favor. Your boss was out of line for speculating and calling you a liar. But being right won't make you keep your job. I'm sorry.",

You pretty clearly aren't. But he seems to be saying your are, and that's a problem.\n\nI once had a boss who said I was abusing my sick time. I showed her how much available sick time I had (nearly all of what we got for the whole year) and that shut her up. \n\nBut I think you're right that he's trying to get you to quit. He doesn't want to pay unemployment. \n\nAnd there's always the possibility that he's just trying to scare you into to never taking any time off without prior approval.\n\nI'd start looking for a better job if I were you. But I wouldn't quit. And I'd ask him to put in writing the specific conditions you need to meet in order for your employment not to be at risk. \n\nAnd make that request in writing. Email him and bcc your personal email address. \n\nThree things could happen: You'll successfully call his bluff and he'll still threatening your job; he'll refuse to tell you what you need to do to satisfy him, which will work against him if he fires you and you file for unemployment; or you'll know exactly what you need to do to keep your job. \n\nIf it's that last thing, then you do it while you find a better job. \n\nBut be aware that a pattern of calling in our being late specifically on Mondays and/or Fridays is often viewed as a likely sign of substance abuse. Obviously, we all get sick on Fridays or Mondays sometimes, but mental health days are probably best taken on other days.",

I am in HR and I think people forget how often they call off.  I hired someone and in the first month they called off 8 times.  When I had to speak with them, they said I never call off.  I went over all of their call offs.  They were shocked there were so many.  These are also the people who claim their checks are short because they forgot they called off last week.  People with bad attendance always try to deny it, but it is tracked.\n\nHe can also require doctor notes.  Which he should be doing.  Calling off on Mondays is a big tell.  It shows a pattern.  I never call off sick without a doctor note.  If I am sick enough not to go to work, I go to the doctor.  Since I have good attention, the boss always says I do not need a note.  And I say I know but here it is.  If you know they are looking to lay people off, I would not call off unless I could provide proof of my call off.  This is just advice, take it or not.\n\nBTW I have a cat and he has long hair.  He is triple coated/Siberian. He does throw up hairballs but it takes me like a minute to clean them. He blows his coat in spring and fall.  It is so much hair!  It has never made me late to work. But I always leave early just in case of bad traffic.  I am always at work at least 15 minutes early every dat.\n\nAs far as discrimination you have to prove that you were fired because you are in a protected class.  Attendance is not protected unless you qualify for FMLA.  People always blame HR when getting fired but it is your behavior that gets you fired.  It is rare for it to be a cause that is discrimination.",

Ask by text or email (so you have a written copy) for him to reiterate what was said at the meeting you just had with him. Often a bad manager will find every flaw in your work performance shortly before a review so he can refuse/reduce a raise (and buy himself a new chair with the budget money). Seriously, I would recommend documenting everything you possibly can and after your review if negative taking it all NOT to hr but to a principle of the company. If there is a chain of command notify his immediate supervisor that you are making an appointment with a principal to discuss his behavior towards you.",

He definitely didn\u2019t handle it with a great deal of finesse, but ultimately habitual absences that follow a pattern should be questioned, and it isn\u2019t against the law. \n\nIf you are an at-will employee in a typical US state, you don\u2019t get \u201cmental health days\u201d, and your job isn\u2019t protected even if you\u2019re legitimately sick. If your absences are disrupting the business, which they usually do, you can be fired. The only way your job would be protected was if you qualified and applied for some type of leave, but a series of one day absences combined with tardiness is a super easy termination. \n\nOthers here are talking about being a member of a protected class, like being disabled or of a minority group, but what they\u2019re either forgetting or unaware of is that being part of the class isn\u2019t even relevant unless YOU can prove that they fired you specifically for that reason, which would require you to be in a position where they couldn\u2019t possibly point to any other cause. Your absences are cause, and \u201cdrunk party girl with boy problems\u201d isn\u2019t a protected class, so the bottom line here is that you either need to find another job or find a way not to be late or absent again. \n\nOh, and I have cats too, they do sometimes throw up hairballs but it takes approximately two minutes to clean, so I\u2019ve never in my life been late for work due to a hairball.

Whenever he passes by the block where I sit, he stares at there. My friend also told me that he always stares there when he passes by.

If you want to change something about yourself, and can afford it, then go for it.

If you are happy to make the changes, then do it especially if you think they have a point. However, being true to who you are is also important. If you don't see a problem, then there may not be one. It could just be you are not measuring up to someone else's idea of a well presented woman.

Now I barely get any shifts even though they used to beg me to come in. That job paid $12/hr and I was supposed to get a raise to $13.50 in July \u2014 but again, I get *no* hours.\n\nI also just interviewed at another place that pays slightly *less* than the job I accepted, but they offer more hours and I\u2019d get tips, which could make it better overall. I\u2019m also leaving for college in August and trying to save up for a trip next year, clothes/supplies, and general expenses \u2014 so I really need the money now.\n\nIf I get the offer from this other place, would it be wrong to quit the job I just accepted? I haven't even started training yet. I don\u2019t want to burn bridges, but I\u2019m broke and need to do what\u2019s best for me financially. What\u2019s the best move here?

So the regular rule at my place of work is that if you call out on your weekend you have to work the next weekend but by choice I work every weekend so that rule doesn\u2019t apply to me. So I\u2019ve been at my place of work for almost 4 years and I was never been told when I called out that I had to give an 2 hour notice and I\u2019ve called out enough times to remember being told that over my almost 4 years. Is it possible that this might be a new rule at my company that I just don\u2019t know about or was the lady on the phone just making things up. Also I need to add that even with calling in 2 hours or 1 hour I\u2019m still going to be telling the supervisor from the night before not my supervisor so I don\u2019t really know what the difference would be if that is the rule. And I never call out last minute I\u2019ll call last minute to let them know I\u2019m late sometimes but that only happens if something unexpected happens on my way to work like a flat tire happened once and we had to call to get a tow truck because I work an hour from home.",

        "text": "Hi all, idk if this is the right place for this post but I'm looking for advice. I am a 25y F and have been working at my company for 2 years, a little more than. I am on the autism spectrum, and due to childhood trauma i suffer a great deal or mental health issues. Recently I lost my nephew in a violent crime, and then my niece just last week. My niece was only 20 weeks in the womb, but all of us have been struggling with her loss because it felt like hope for our family after my nephew (11) was murdered. Today I tried to go to work but I can tell I'm just not all there mentally. When asking to go home early I was told,\"you might as well because I can tell you won't give it your all today if you dont. But sometimes we need to leave our homelife at the Door. My sister in law had a miscarriage and I still came in.\" It really made me mad. Maybe I'm just a little raw from the loss but idk if that kind of comment is appropriate from a boss? She's also said other stuff that bothers me. For example, a few weeks ago she rightfully scolded me and a coworker for chatting by saying,\"i dont know what it is youre not understanding, are you just not listening?\" and then said,\"by the way I'm not mad at you, I know you're sensitive\". Idk any opinions and advice is appreciated, is this normal? Or is my boss insensitive and or crossing lines? ",

                "body": "I\u2019m so confused here. You literally start this post by essentially describing how your autism and trauma makes you sensitive, and you want to take time off because someone who isn\u2019t you or your partner had a stillbirth, yet you take offense at your boss acknowledging that you are sensitive. You can\u2019t both want people to tread carefully around you because you\u2019re sensitive and traumatized, while also getting upset if someone refers to your sensitivity. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what your complaint is. Your boss allowed you to go home early when you asked, which she didn\u2019t have to do, so anyone blasting her for lacking empathy is merely entitled. She let you go, but she rightfully explained that you as an employee are expected to leave your personal problems at home. Would you prefer that she kept her mouth shut and just fired you next the you missed work? \n\nWhat she said wasn\u2019t unreasonable either. People can empathize with you, they can feel sympathy for your loss, without giving you a free pass on missing work. The reality is that adults have to go to work, and for most, your losses would only get them a day off for the funeral. Parents have to return to work a few days after losing their children. Women have worked through their own miscarriages. Hell, people take a long lunch to go for a routine checkup, get diagnosed with cancer, and they have to return to finish the day. \n\nIn a perfect world we\u2019d all be able to stay home but this world isn\u2019t perfect. Your boss told you the simple truth. We all have shit in our lives, everyone you see around you have struggles of their own, but the functional adults among them go to work.",

If you have sick time or PTO use it for things like this. You now have left her short handed at the last minute and brought your personal life to work which affects team morale. \n\nHer job is getting you and her team to do their jobs and meet their goals. She can\u2019t go to her boss and say \u201cwell one of my team members had a personal problem and so I let them go home and that is why we didn\u2019t complete the xxxxx\u201d. She will somehow have to cover her job and yours now. You were hired for a job, she is asking you to complete the job and leave your personal life at the door. She let you go home and set expectations for the future. This is a job, not a charity. She was very empathetic to your situation\u2026.more than she needed to be. You are asking for exceptions because of your personal life. \n\nI am very sensitive too, remember to understand this is work, not friends, not family. If you can\u2019t do the job that day use a sick day. No need to bring your personal life to work. I am not saying you shouldn\u2019t take a sick day or be upset\u2026.that sounds very upsetting and sad so please be good to yourself. Mental health is important. I tell my team all the time to take a day off and deal with their problems as I can\u2019t have their personal lives affecting the team. It affects our revenue and affects every single person at that company. Over sympathetic managers can tank a company causing layoffs, raises for team members pulling their weight to be denied, etc. start using your sensitivity to try and understand how your behavior affects others too, not just yourself. I know that sounds harsh but that is life. We all have problems and it is our responsibility to keep our problems from hurting others.",

Anyway, a co worker told me there would be a reorganization for when I come back. \nFor a little background information, my boss was laid off as an assistant director late last year and I was basically doing his job for the past 2 years but just didn\u2019t have the title. He was a great guy, just didn\u2019t do his job so I wasn\u2019t surprised they let him go. \nAnyway, HIS boss has basically been in his own words \u201cgrooming\u201d me to become the next AD for the past 2 years\u2026he\u2019s been dangling this promotion in my face for a long time. Saying things like \u201cthis is your team and once the current AD leaves or if something happens, this team will go to you.\u201d I\u2019ve been attending meetings that he should\u2019ve attended, I\u2019ve been meeting with the program director for the past 2 years and basically took on the role of assistant director without the pay.\nNow when I go back, they aren\u2019t creating the assistant director position anymore and what they are doing is having \u201cmy team\u201d report to a another assistant director on another team so basically combining two small teams and I\u2019ll have to report to another assistant director so they won\u2019t give me the role. \nDo I still continue to go to these meetings each week with the program director, and the leadership team??? I mean, I don\u2019t think it makes sense to be there if I\u2019m not getting the title or the pay. \nOn one hand I\u2019m annoyed because I\u2019ve worked hard in the past 2 years to try and get that AD role and my boss has been dangling it in front of my face and I just want to tell him off. \nOn the other hand\u2026.I jut want to go into work and do the bare minimum and clock in and out and just focus on my family. \nAnd on the other hand\u2026my priorities changed, I just had a second baby and all I can really think about and care about are my kids and life is so much bigger than a promotion that I don\u2019t really care lol. Like I just feel lucky to have a work from home job\u2026..\n\nWhat would you do when I go back to work?? How should I approach this because I know \u201cmy team\u201d will probably be saying something to me that I was robbed of the promotion as I know they were rooting for me to get it. ",

However, It doesn\u2019t appear that you\u2019ve been \u201crobbed\u201d of the promotion, but that business needs have changed. Often in a reorg teams move under existing leaders to avoid creating additional headcount. That they have left the position open for 2 years is probably an indication that the role is redundant \n\nI know that\u2019s not what you want to hear, but it probably has nothing to do with you and more about the bottom line if thats what is happening",

        "text": "Hi, I\u2019m looking for some advice on my current work situation.\n\nI\u2019ve been working at a social service agency for 1.5 years in a front-facing role supporting elderly beneficiaries. It\u2019s a small team, and I\u2019ve built strong relationships with my beneficiaries, community partners, colleagues, and even staff from other departments. While the work is fulfilling, management challenges have been making it hard for me to stay motivated.\n\nInitially, things were okay. But when Manager A joined last September, the dynamics shifted. She micromanaged the team, overburdened us, and took credit for work she barely contributed to. By the start of this year, I was already thinking of resigning because her unrealistic expectations led to a low appraisal rating for me, which affected my increment. To make matters worse, I realized I was being paid less than others in the same role who were fairly appraised.\n\nHowever, Manager A resigned at the end of January, and since my main grievance was resolved, I decided to stay.\n\nNow, a new manager (Manager B) joined in May, and things have become unbearable again. While she constantly complains about being overworked, she spends most of the day commenting or chatting, disrupting everyone\u2019s focus. My colleagues share the same sentiments.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse are two recent incidents where I disagreed with her approach. Without going into specifics, these episodes made it clear that she expects us to support her managerial duties but doesn\u2019t reciprocate when it comes to helping us with operational tasks or ground-level work, even though she verbalized that she will support the team. This has been my main motivation to resign.\n\nAt the same time, I\u2019m contemplating as:\n1. I\u2019ve built a strong rapport with my beneficiaries and external partners.\n2. My current teammates and colleagues in other departments are supportive and collaborative.\n3. My former manager, who has since been promoted, recognizes and values my contributions.\n\nDespite all this, I don\u2019t feel I can thrive under a direct manager who doesn\u2019t support her team adequately. I\u2019ve started looking for other roles but feel conflicted about leaving.\n\nAppreciate any advice, thank you! ",

Your coworkers are clearly lying to you, probably with their own motives. If you\u2019re not happy with this job, find another one, and once you get a start date with the new job, leave your current employer.",

My job is focusing fixing users' problem, make sure the software is safe for users.\nOkay salary, good benefits.\n\nBut might be toxic working environment. \n\n- Managers keep changing the policy rules which narrow down the flexibility in shifts and holiday.\n\n- KPI more and more. Sometimes we feel like we are just numbers.\n\n- When the performance review season is coming, people are trying to report at each other with tiny issues, to get some extra points.\n\n- No one cares about team-work spirit anymore.\n\n- If you are excited about improvements and ideas, you have to go through many layers of approval. Then it might be rejected. And one day it appears as someone else's idea.\n\n- If the managers got investigation from Employee Union, they will say that everyone makes mistake and they will adjust their managing style. But they has been saying same thing like that for 10 years without changes.\n\n(*) Coffee shop\n\nI am helping take care of a small coffee shop in weekend for a person in the neighbor area.\n\nEveryone comes with order and say thank you when they left. Some funny stories everyday, some jokes, smiles all the time.\n\nThe most important thing, if I follow the business rules, no one will breathe against my neck to ask for more and more. \n\nThey dont expect a normal employee to change the world and be the superman. \n\n==> My take-away notes and questions:\n\n- I know that we can not fairly compare an office job to a coffee shop job because they are different on several aspects.\nBut it feels like office workers, (majorily) in tech area,  spend a lot of energy and effort to improve the system has big impacts on consumers but got no respect much from employers.\nIs the employers getting more and more greedy and toxic?\n\n- Is that lacking of true human connection in the office working environment drives people burn out easily?\n\n- I honestly feel so lost and robotic in my office job. Just wanna note down some words, hoping to get more insights from people.\n",

        "post-author": "ThrowRAlobotomy666",
        "text": "This is a very touchy subject so I'll be both delicate but frank. I work in health care at an urgent care/doctors office while I'm in school. A few weeks ago while opening, I found religious pamphlets around the waiting room and bathroom that were different flavours but the same message: \"You are a horrible person without god. You need to repent for your sins. If you don't, you will die a fiery death in hell.\". Now that's a synopsis, these readings went way more in depth and even had calls to actions and guilt trips, the whole nine yards. I confiscated them before patients got there, but I don't know if they were there the evening before or who put them there. \n\nLast night, I found a book called \"praying women\" and on the cover in sharpie was \"for the patients of {my practice}\". Left in the waiting room on the urgent care side. I found it by the end of the night and took it so that it wouldn't be there for patients to read today. \n\nNow I have worked for another religious practice before and the religious harassment I faced (as I did not practice their religion, but another) was unreal. I would hate for a patient to come in and see this and think our staff or organization is trying to push this agenda when they are just trying to receive care. It would become a place where some people, especially those who have faced that type of harassment before, would then feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. \n\nMy predicament is do I tell my supervisors? Because it's not like I know who the patient(s) is/are leaving them. And I guess there's technically no rule against leaving things like that. And twice is a coincidence, if it happened a third time, then it would be a pattern. But I only work part-time, it could be happening other times. And as far as I know, I'm the only non-christian on staff so I would be more sensitive to this stuff so maybe I'm being dramatic. \n\nWhat do I do? ",

The practice wouldn't even *know* your stance on politics or reproductive rights unless you made a point to tell them. I think the very notion of you using that as an analogy is... insane. It certainly shows you have no idea how it works.\n\nIf I go to a doctor's office and they have religious pamphlets in their waiting room stating that I'm a horrible person, I could reasonably worry about whether they'll see in my chart that I'm an atheist (it's in there, I checked) and prescribe something for my heart problem that they know won't work because if I die that's one less atheist in the world. We are, after all, the second most hated minority in the country. Or maybe they'll do it because I'm gay (which is also in my chart - again, I checked). We're the *most* hated minority in the country.\n\nBeing an anti-choice \"conservative\" is *not* a legally protected \"protected class\" like being an atheist is, and like being gay is in some states. A doctor's office could have anti-choice pamphlets, and if I didn't like it all I could do is go somewhere else. But the moment they have something pushing religion in their waiting room, it becomes an issue of religious discrimination for anyone whose religious beliefs differ.",

Only items placed by the staff with the approval of the owners of the practice should be allowed. Someone leaving literature about their beliefs is not harrassment of you. Leaving them in your locker, on your desk, etc. is targeted to you. Leaving them in a waiting room is not harrassment.

        "text": "Hello everyone, this is my first time on this subreddit so if I am in the wrong place I apologize but I had a question that\u2019s been on my mind for a while now. \n\nFor context, I work at a city run pool and I have been there for 9 years now. For the city I teach swim lessons, lifeguard, work the front desk, I\u2019m a swim coach, a WSIT instructor, and one of our lesson leads overseeing our swim lessons program. I am also a Kinesiology major with a specialization in teaching and still in school. \n\nNow for the problem/question. Back in January my boss told me that they would be shifting positions at the facility, meaning that the head swim coach position, something I have been wanting for a long time now, would be opening up. So in a meeting with my boss I mentioned that there was a class I needed to take in order to graduate in Spring 2026, however it would make it so I couldn\u2019t coach 2 of our 5 weekly practices. They told me that I wouldn\u2019t get head coach if I did that but, I\u2019d be guaranteed the position by March if I didn\u2019t take the class, so I didn\u2019t take it, which pushed my graduation date to Spring 2028. Here we are in May, and I found out from someone else that they just handed the position over to someone without swimming experience and they never even did any interviews for it. \n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! We also typically have a 1000 hour limit as part time employees at our facility, and recently I was given a new limit of 1400 hours since I normally get up to the limit and then can\u2019t work for a few weeks at the end of the year. My boss ended up telling me that I HAD to work 1200 hours though or they would take away the extra hours I got, so for the past 4 months, I went in 2 hours early and did all of the head coaches work for $13 less an hour than what they make. I recently found out that it was a blatant lie that my hours would be reduced if I didn\u2019t work enough.\n\nOverall, my question is if this is something that is allowed to occur? I feel like I was completely manipulated into doing all of my bosses work, just for them to give the position to someone else and I feel demotivated to even keep working at this facility anymore even though I absolutely love my team\n\nTLDR: My boss lied to me about getting a new position and my hours to make their job easier and I don\u2019t know what to do.",

I've been working 7 days straight. My only other office employee just quit (the 10th time this has happened in my tenure), leaving me completely alone again. I've been actively interviewing and expect to hear back on a new job offer early next week. My foot is already out the door.\n\nThe Incident:\nToday, the 7th day in a row working, my boss walked into my office to question a guest dispute. When I explained I didn't have time for a call and sent an email instead, he screamed, \"Do your f-ing job!\"\n\nI politely asked him, \"Please don't talk to me like that.\"\n\nHis response: \"I can talk to you however the F I want to.\"\n\nI didn\u2019t respond. At that point, I couldn't take it anymore. I left work immediately and cancelled the 3 PM meeting for our team. \n\nMy Dilemma - What do I do now?\n\n1. Give two weeks' notice today? (Without knowing if I got the new job yet).\n2. Wait until early next week to put in notice? (After I know if I got the new job, but this means enduring this environment longer).\n\n3.Quit today, file for unemployment, and explore a hostile work environment claim? (A coworker was present and can corroborate the verbal abuse).\n\nI'm completely burned out and this latest incident was the final straw. What's the best move here to protect myself financially and professionally?\n\nThanks for any help!",

I'm not licensed in California, but it appears that the law only covers unlawful violence, credible threats of violence, or harassment. It doesn't look to me like the incident described above would qualify as any of those.\n\n\n\n\nSEC. 2.5. Section 527.8 is added to the Code of Civil Procedure, to read:\n\n527.8. (a) Any employer or collective bargaining representative of an employee who has suffered harassment, unlawful violence, or a credible threat of violence from any individual, that can reasonably be construed to be carried out or to have been carried out at the workplace, may seek a temporary restraining order and an order after hearing on behalf of the employee and, at the discretion of the court, any number of other employees at the workplace, and, if appropriate, other employees at other workplaces of the employer. For purposes of this section only, a person may bring a petition for a temporary restraining order and an order after hearing on behalf of an employee as their collective bargaining representative only if the person serves as a collective bargaining representative for that employee in employment or labor matters at the employee\u2019s workplace.\n\n(b) For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) \u201cCourse of conduct\u201d is a pattern of conduct composed of a series of acts over a period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of purpose, including following or stalking an employee to or from the place of work; entering the workplace; following an employee during hours of employment; making telephone calls to an employee; or sending correspondence to an employee by any means, including, but not limited to, the use of the public or private mails, interoffice mail, facsimile, or computer email.\n\n(2) \u201cCredible threat of violence\u201d is a knowing and willful statement or course of conduct that would place a reasonable person in fear for their safety, or the safety of their immediate family, and that serves no legitimate purpose.\n\n...\n\n(4) \u201cHarassment\u201d is a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person that seriously alarms, annoys, or harasses the person, and that serves no legitimate purpose. The course of conduct must be that which would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress, and must actually cause substantial emotional distress.\n\n...\n\n(8) \u201cUnlawful violence\u201d is any assault or battery, or stalking as prohibited in Section 646.9 of the Penal Code, but shall not include lawful acts of self-defense or defense of others.",

Tell them that you expect an apology. Don\u2019t threaten to go to HR or anything, your boss will be able to read between the lines. I think one of three things will happen. \n1. A fake apology - this is fine. It means it won\u2019t happen again. You can\u2019t change people, but you can teach them how to treat you.\n2. A real apology - awesome! Maybe your manager was just stressed out (although I figure they\u2019d probably apologize if their own volition if this were the case)\n3. A double-down, followed by retaliation. In this case, your manager would just be digging their own grave. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t come to that, but if you can document retaliation, nothing bad will happen to you",

Being understaffed, especially if you're the one responsible for doing the hiring, isn't going to be enough to prove a hostile work environment.\n\nYour boss losing their temper once doesn't constitute a hostile work environment. It sounds as if you're under a lot of stress and need a break. If quitting your job is the only way you'll get that break, then perhaps that is what needs to be done. But I wouldn't get your hopes up for being able to collect unemployment or for being able to sue your employer based on what you've shared here.\n\nHire the missing staff member you need and get yourself out of the working 7-days a week cycle before you make any drastic decisions. Being sleep deprived messes with your brain. Make sure any decisions you're making are made with a clear head.",

If you have I would send forward that email again and mention this is why you emailed instead of calling as it was more time productive. Also stating that you are reiterating as you did today that under no circumstances is it ok to speak to you in that tone or manner. Copy HR. I know HR in many cases HR is not for the employee but you want some record of this. And if they do let you go you are no worse off than if you left but have better chances of getting unemployment until something pans out. \n\nDon't quit unless you can afford to.

You send an email to your boss addressing the situation and bcc your personal email, then request a meeting with HR. \n\nAny interactions you have with your boss are immediately clarified back to them in writing with the caveat, please confirm this is what was discussed and agreed to. Remember, no response is a response. Documenting in these situations takes a lot of time but well worth the effort. Any time they come at you in a disrespectful way, document, email, then contact HR. After 3 incidents, I\u2019d contact a lawyer.\n\nHopefully you get the job but still maintain your professionalism. Give them notice. If you have remaining PTO, use it to the end of your time. If you give them 30 days ( as a manager, you should) and have 2 wks of PTO, let them know your last in office day is X, I\u2019ll be using my vacation from A-B dates.

Here's some info:\n\n\n-Shortly after I was hired on I asked what she was working on during a meeting break and she yelled her answer in my face, then immediately said she was sorry for barking at me\n\n-If I say good morning, most of the time she ignores me\n\n-She repeats what I say in meetings and talks over me other times\n\n-She has raised her voice at me in front of our entire team and after people started staring at her, she laughed and said she was just joking around \n\n-I was given a task at work that I really wanted and now she has something similar\n\n-I started dressing nicer at work then she started wearing similar things and cut her hair to look like mine\n\n-If we are both at a meeting and I talk to someone, she will immediately go over and talk to them right after me\n\n-I needed something from her to do my job and she ignored me so then another coworker and I wasted a whole day struggling with a task\n\nI rarely see her, but when I do she does these things. I'm guessing that our manager has probably told her to stop, but I think she does a lot of work for him so she is allowed to act this way. \n\nDo you think it's worth it to have a meeting with our manager?\n\n\nTLDR: My older coworker lashes out at me periodically and acts strange but I don't know why or what to do",

If you do, make it a regular thing to remark (not really complain \ud83e\uddd0) about this colleague. Things like - \u201cI tried to ask Stella for help on this tricky task that she knows so well, but we couldn\u2019t connect.\u201d Or - \u201cWhen Stella broke in to the meeting convo and amplified my statement about xyz yesterday.\u201d Calling attention to her behavior, in a non-confrontational fashion.\n\nDon\u2019t \u2018complain\u2019, but don\u2019t praise, either. Simply \u2026 state. In every single meeting that you have with him. Hopefully, he will manage her better. \n\nBut,if things don\u2019t improve - if her jealousy drives her to act out more egregiously, tell your manager that she has created a \u2018hostile work environment\u2019 (use this exact phrase!), and that you are considering a report to HR. Let him know that you have documented every hostile action/exchange. Give him one opportunity to get better results, and if things don\u2019t improve, follow through.\n\nGood luck, OP.

I've been dealing with this for way too long and I am on my last leg.\n\nI work as a programs manager in higher education and am receiving a very low salary for the amount of work/responsibilities I have. The past few months I've been in \"survival mode\" at work due to the amount of demands. I've communicated with my supervisor, with the department head, and a few others that I am at max capacity and cannot take on anymore, especially with the low pay I receive. To this day, I am still being asked to do extra work (not on my job description) and given no extra compensation. I am doing my best to draw boundaries but they are not being respected. I'm being seen as someone that keeps \"rocking the boat\" but everyone on my team is struggling and I've finally had it. After I started reporting these things, now there is talk about giving everyone a \"bonus\" but I am just so exhausted with being asked to do one thing after another. \n\nI am constantly applying to new jobs, but I'm being guilted for not being happy here because they've \"already given me raises\" (not enough for the workload!!!!). My job was posted already at such a low salary when I got hired, and they all know this. \n\n  \nPlease help how do I get them to hear me and listen to me when I say I cannot do anymore. ",

        "text": "UPDATE:\nSo. I spoke with Brody on Wednesday about his comments. I listed the specific instances where he left me feeling uncomfortable. I also told him that I feel he treats me differently than my peers - all of whom are much older than me. He asked how he is treating me differently. I told him that I couldn\u2019t envision him asking my older male coworker if he reads porn. Brody said \u201cyeah, I honestly would. If he told me he enjoyed reading, I would definitely be like \u2018well what kind of reading do you do?\u2019\u201d\u2026 \n\nI asked him if he could see how that is a very different (and normal) question compared to the question he asked me. I could tell he was irritated with my response, but he just said \u201cokay.\u201d\n\nHe did apologize for the comments and making me feel uncomfortable. He had a plethora of excuses for each instance. However, I ultimately told him that, regardless the intention, I don\u2019t like how he talks to me or the subjects he broaches, so he needs to stop what he has been doing and be more aware moving forward. He understood that well enough. \n\nI think he was scared at this point that I was going to go to HR or his boss- which I did not end up doing. He kept emphasizing how important his job is to him. Then he came by my office later asking if we could start over. I told him that is perfectly fine by me so long as the understanding stays in place. He walked up to me, reintroduced himself, and extended his hand with wild eyes and an enthusiastic smile. Creepy and embarrassing? Yes. But I shook his hand, laughed awkwardly, and told him to take a chill pill. \n\nI updated my older female coworker on the issue. She asked if I felt his apology was sincere. I think it is a mixed bag. I actually believe he was mortified by what I had to say. Whether the mortification came from the fear of losing his job or the realization that a younger female could find his sexually charged comments/interactions off-putting - I am not sure. So, yes, his reaction was genuine, but I do not think his intentions with his inappropriate comments were good from the start - no matter the apology he gave. I did not get the sense that he was mortified because I was uncomfortable. More so I think he really thought he was doing something I would find attractive and was horrified when he turned out to be wrong. He didn\u2019t want me to be uncomfortable, but I think he did want me to swoon, especially with the arrogant way he paraded around. Regardless, I would be shocked if his behavior continues based on his response. If nothing changes, I will be marching on over to HR and his boss to make sure it stops. Thank you everyone for the advice!\n\nI am a 23F working for the judicial system. Our office recently hired a new boss - let\u2019s call him Brody, 37M. He used to work for a different entity that our office often collaborated with, so I have had interactions with him prior to him taking on this new role as my boss. To be honest, I had reservations when I heard he got the job. While he has always been kind and well-liked, something about my interactions with him left me uneasy. He likes to be the smartest guy in the room and comes off arrogant. I remember disliking this about him when I first met him, but I got over it quick. A minor irritant- no biggie. \n\nHowever, about five months before he took the job, my ex-boss looped him in on some issues I was having with a coworker. Said coworker is known for being aggressive, reactive, and a bit of a bully. I stood up for myself in a professional way when she attempted to demean me (no name-calling or passive aggression, just being upfront). She threw a fit and had the entire office walking on egg shells for months because my boss refused to do anything to check her behavior (but that is all a story for another time). Anyway, Brody made a trip to our office for a meeting and decided to talk to me about it. I think he was wanting to give me advice? I could tell he was trying to be sensitive to my issue, but it didn\u2019t feel like that sensitivity  was out of concern for my wellbeing. I got the impression that he wanted me to THINK he was sensitive to my issue so that I would feel validated and more open to his suggestions. Ultimately, he gave me a sugar-coated \u201cget over it and keep the peace since she is making everyone\u2019s life a living hell.\u201d I think this interaction and his arrogant nature caused me to have some hesitation. It left me with the impression that he may try to manipulate me into doing what is best for HIM while framing it as him looking out for MY best interest\u2026 and he thinks he is smart enough to get away with that kind of thing unnoticed. He has also been dishonest about things in the past.\n\nAnyway, on Brody\u2019s second day of him being my new boss, he wanted to talk to me. He asked how things were going with my coworker. I said that things were alright - irritating at times - but manageable. He told me that I need to kill her with kindness and work on true forgiveness to take my power back\u2026 I told him that there wasn\u2019t anything actively wrong between us - that it had been five months since it resolved. I said I had forgiven her but no longer trusted her after what happened. He didn\u2019t believe me. In fact, he responded by saying \u201cI know how women are. You guys don\u2019t let go of things.\u201d He made the argument that me keeping her at an arms length must mean I have not truly forgiven her\u2026 \nlike.. no, dude. I just don\u2019t want to open up the door for that type of situation to happen again.\n\nHe ended up lecturing me for an hour and a half about how my rocky relationship with her is impacting the clients we work with (she and I have been working just fine together since the conflict, so I don\u2019t know why he said that - on his second day, no less), how I just haven\u2019t been the same since the incident with her, how I am usually so positive, but haven\u2019t been because of this issue, and so on. Most of the conversation was hyper focused on his concerns about my happiness.\n\nAt this point, I started to get widged out. Brody doesn\u2019t know anything about me, so him saying that I \u201cjust haven\u2019t been the same\u201d made me uncomfortable. I tried to tell him that I am actually a rather negative person, but that I work really hard to be more positive. I also told him that, during the conflict, my husband, who is very self-assuring and self righteous, was the only one encouraging me to keep pushing forward through the discomfort of the situation. I noted that I strive to be more self-assured like my husband. Brody\u2019s response was \u201cbut is that really you though? Is that who you want to be?\u201d\n\nThis particular statement was triggering to me. I was molested as a young teen by my coach. My coach would often use similar statements and tactics to confuse me, make me feel like she knew me better than I knew me, and she would try to drive a wedge between my relationships to control me. I felt like him calling into question who I want to be was not only an attempt at that type of manipulation, but also\u2026 gee, I don\u2019t know? Insulting towards my husband? Who doesn\u2019t want to be self-assured?? Why try to frame that as a negative thing?\n\nFor the love of Pete.\n\nAt some point he asked me what I do to relax outside of work since the job is stressful. I said I read and visit family. He said \u201cIs it reading, or is it really just porn?\u201d \n\nI got so red in the face and so hot because I was SO embarrassed by that question. I wanted the conversation to end, so I finally seceded and told him I would try to kill my coworker with kindness. I got up to leave, but he said \u201cSee that business card on that table?\u201d I said \u201cYeah.\u201d He said \u201cTry and pick it up.\u201d I reached out and picked up the card. He clicked his tongue and said something to the effect of \u201cah, you didn\u2019t get it. Put it down and try again.\u201d I understood at that point what he was getting at. I put the card down, made a half-hearted attempt to reach for it, and looked to him to see if I passed his stupid test. He said \u201cExactly. You can do better than trying.\u201d\n\nWeird power play that made me feel two inches tall? Absolutely. But I left. Since then, he has made other comments. He asked me if I am more submissive or if I get aggressive in hostile/uncomfortable situations. Then he started to play out a scenario where he comes into my office aggressively. I felt like he was trying to gain intel on what he can expect if he ever tries some of that BS with me. So, I explained I would likely look at him like he was a nut job if he tried that and probably tell him to get lost. He responded with a decisive \u201cSo you would submit.\u201d Uh, no. That isn\u2019t what I said. \n\nYesterday he asked me a question that I didn\u2019t know the answer to. I told him I didn\u2019t know. He said \u201cNo, no, no - you know. Don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t.\u201d I sat there feeling like I was under a microscope. I was staring at the ground with my arms across my body when I repeated that I didn\u2019t know. Then he said to me- in a very flirty way- \u201cWhy are you being so coy?\u201d My older male coworker came around the corner just as he said that. This coworker is aware of some of the crap I have been so uncomfortable by. I used him as my scapegoat to get out of the conversation. \n\nHe and another female coworker, who is also older, confirmed that Brody doesn\u2019t treat them like he treats me. He doesn\u2019t psychoanalyze them or ask if they read porn. He isn\u2019t overly concerned about their comfort or their happiness (something he continues to bring up to me). \n\nI have felt very stuck in this situation. I need To address it to get it to stop. My husband and I have been practicing the best way for me to say what I need to say. However, I am worried if I tell Brody my concerns and make clear my limits, he will concoct a story where I am the aggressor. He talks all the time about false allegations, needing to play \u201cthe game\u201d, needing to positively manipulate, and documenting everything, etc. All I hear when he talks about those things is that HE is capable of being vindictive and conniving to avoid consequences. Should I speak to him first or go above his head to his boss? Our HR is a complete joke- they will just refer me back to my own department. \n\nAdditional info as if there wasn\u2019t enough already:\n\nI doubt this guy will face much pushback from this situation. Our office is in a bind and we desperately need a manager to figure out budgetary concerns. We were without a boss for around three months while the hiring process was taking place. So, I will likely have to keep working with him and don\u2019t want it to be uncomfortable forever. Brody has been here less than one month. Everyone in the higher ups seem to think he is wonderful. The situation I dealt with as a child is another layer here. I don\u2019t want to think the worst of this guy if he is harmless. It makes me feel guilty and like I am projecting past trauma. But then I also tell myself \u201cif it feels this familiar, like someone is trying to groom me, then there is probably a reason for that familiarity.\u201d Anyway. Any advice or suggestions would be great. ",

I assume there\u2019s an ADHD subreddit, so ask for advice on how to do that and other specific trouble points there.\n\nStart applying now to jobs at grocery stores or just anywhere. Make sure your parents know you are actually trying, actually actively searching for a job. Ask them for a grace period for staying at home to save up some money before they kick you out, or if they would let you stay longer if you start doing more chores around the house.\n\nWhile you\u2019re waiting to see a doctor about your ADHD (have you actually requested/scheduled medical help with this yet and let them know how severely it is effecting your ability to function?), keep in mind there are behavior changes you can make to improve your symptoms. Keeping on a good sleep schedule (look up jet lag solutions for a start), exercise (weightlifting or aerobic), and caffeine (check your Starbucks website to see how much caffeine their drinks have and don\u2019t exceed that amount), (yes, stimulants actually help with ADHD). I know that none of these things are easy, but they will significantly help.\n\nRemember that you are young, so any job, even those that get little respect, is acceptable for you. School janitor, low-level hospital worker, anything is just fine for a starter job. And if you enjoy it, stick with it. If you don\u2019t, start looking for something different after a year or so.\n\nAfter you get settled in a job, start looking for ways to take classes to get caught up and to learn new skills for advancing to better jobs.",

I've done good to stay on top of it so far, but I feel my knees buckling under the weight of holding this globe. I've now caused a mistake entirely of my own doing and will have to face consequences and I am terrified. I don't think anything insane will happen, but being a disappointment and not living up to people's expectations scares me and I don't know what to do. \n\nThe incoherent rambling long version:\nThis year I started a new job. My previous job was a hell hole and I was ecstatic to leave. My new job is great, the people are awesome, pay is good, benefits are amazing, but I have one problem: myself. I constantly get praised here. I'm told how I'm the \"best employee ever hired\" and literally everyone sings my praises even when I'm not around. This is nice and all, and I really do appreciate it, but it's left me with this building pressure. I feel like the real me can't live up to these expectations everyone has set for me. I feel like I'm just a fraud scamming everyone. I just do the most simple things and they praise me. I try and be helpful, and I basically get worshipped. The reason this is all coming to a head now is because I was left as the only employee in my department this week. I was asked by my boss to do one specific thing. I have been doing other things and, admittedly, procrastinating a lot. Now its the last day of our work week and the other person needed to do the thing my boss asked me is not here today. They have been here every other day this week and I said to myself \"Ah, I'll just do it all Friday!\" And now I'm boned. When we get back to the office on Tuesday I know my boss will ask if it's done and I have to say no. I keep expecting to get fired, or yelled at, or to have something thrown at me (those last two were staples of my previous boss). So far, my current boss has been understanding, but this is the first time I've just procrastinated a SINGULAR THING I was asked to do.  I'm just terrified of being a disappointment. I don't really know what to do with all this floating in my head. My anxiety is building up worse and worse, this is a 3 day weekend for us and I know because of this I'll be miserable all weekend. I know this is just incoherent rambling but I'm just trying to let it all out here I guess. ",

        "text": "So, I've been at my workplace for about three years. I have an incredibly consistent \"attendance rate\" (I've called out maybe twice in all three years and am incredibly on time to my shifts). Recently, I had to leave with about three hours left of my shift due to a family emergency (car-crash level emergency). I called my manager, apologized profusely, and was told that I \"needed to call someone to cover the rest of my shift\". We're understaffed, and because of the weekend (Memorial Day), everyone who wasn't already there was on vacation. I left, however, I had already called out for my shift the day after that due to an unrelated family emergency (I had given them at least two days of notice to find someone, and was informed by my manager that they \"wouldn't be able to find any coverage\" even after I had tried to find My Own coverage) and now I fear that my job is in jeopardy. Again, I've been an incredibly reliable employee and I feel severely anxious about all of this and I'm just trying to ensure my own job security, if that's even viable at this point-- I'm also trying to make sure I'm not an asshole of an employee, but am willing to take on criticism. I tried to find coverage for the day I called out, but again due to the holiday and the limited amount of phone numbers I had, I couldn't find anyone. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

        "post-author": "Immediate_Bed_7136",
        "text": "For context, my company is very tiny and there are two single bathrooms in the whole facility. They are technically designated men\u2019s/woman\u2019s rooms, but when one is occupied and you need to go, most people just use whichever is not occupied. \n\nThere is an older woman at work who cornered me in the parking lot the other day about my bathroom habits, basically telling me that she \u201chad three babies\u201d and pees a LOT and thinks that I spend too much time in the bathroom and that she\u2019s going to start knocking when she has to go and I\u2019m in there, blah blah blah. I do have stomach issues so when I\u2019m in there I do usually need around 10ish minutes, so initially I thought the conversation was weird but I was like\u2026ok I guess?? I don\u2019t really know how to change my bathroom habits bc it\u2019s not something I can control lol and there is also another bathroom she can always use if it\u2019s a genuine emergency and she just needs to pee quick. She also made a big deal about wanting to do this \u201cprivately\u201d and \u201cnot wanting to embarrass me\u201d and just kept saying that over and over again in our conversation. \n\nI found out the next day that immediately following our conversation she went inside and was talking to multiple people about the conversation she had with me (so much for not wanting to embarrass me and trying to keep it private???) and had been making comments about \u201chow much easier it is to get into the bathroom now\u201d even though I literally haven\u2019t changed my bathroom habits AT ALL since we spoke? And it seems like my bathroom trips have become a frequent subject of her general office talk. The same person who told me all of this (a close trusted friend) told me that she has notifications set up on her teams to monitor my activity and tell her when I am and am not active/in the bathroom. Mind you, our jobs NEVER intersect, we have absolutely no reason to ever message or even work with each other and she has zero authority over me, so she has absolutely no reason to monitor my teams activity to tell her when I\u2019m active or not active so she can see when and how long I\u2019m in the bathroom for. \n\nFor additional context, I\u2019ve been at this company for almost four years and no one has ever said anything to me about the time I spend in the bathroom, and this woman has been here for six months and suddenly it\u2019s an issue? I\u2019m honestly just insanely mortified and violated and just like sick over this. I want to talk to HR but I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m overreacting, even though it absolutely infuriates me to find out that this is something that this woman is actively monitoring and frequently brings up to other employees. I want to scream I\u2019m so mad, but am I insane for feeling that way? I\u2019m like, maybe I do take too long in the bathroom? But I literally can\u2019t help it!! And there\u2019s also another bathroom she could use!! So I genuinely don\u2019t know what to do! She makes me so uncomfortable I just never want to speak to her again, and I want to go to her boss but based on what my friend is telling me it seems like her boss might kind of in on it too and that it\u2019s become just this weird joke of sorts that I just haven\u2019t been aware of for months. Ugh I just want her to know that I know and I want her to be as uncomfortable as I am. Would I be overreacting by saying something?\n\nEdit: an additional thing I\u2019m worried about is outing my friend for telling me and ruining her relationship with this woman bc they have to work very closely with each other. Not to get into specifics, but even if I don\u2019t explicitly say it was my friend who told me, it would be very obvious and there wouldn\u2019t really be any question as to how or why I know all of this now. And since the only thing she really did to me was say something to me in the parking lot and then knock on the bathroom door the day after our conversation, all of the things I want to complain about (like monitoring my teams which I just think is so inappropriate) are things that I wouldn\u2019t know unless my friend had told me. But the issue is that now I do know and I\u2019m so uncomfortable. ",

        "text": "Hi all! \n\nBottom line up front: I\u2019d like some input on how I should proceed with a toxic manager after giving my notice. \n\nBackstory: I\u2019d given my boss about 3.5 weeks notice that I was going to be leaving the company. Originally, I was going on a month long leave of absence for most of June due to other commitments/life. I\u2019d informed my direct supervisor that I\u2019d decided I would not be returning after my LOA. I\u2019ll finish out the posted schedule, but that would be it. Cool. \n\nWithin a week of that, my boss started changing my work schedule very last minute. We\u2019d had our schedules posted for a couple weeks, and he\u2019d change my days off with less than a week notice to me. When brought up, he\u2019d essentially tell me \u201ceither be there or find someone to cover you.\u201d Didn\u2019t matter that I\u2019d already had plans, I\u2019d get the \u201cthis is your responsibility Purple_Charcoal.\u201d \n\nAfter the second time of him last minute changing my days off, I changed my final date. Instead of it being June 3rd, I bumped it up sooner by a week. He, of course, started telling me how \u201cI was screwing him over.\u201d \n\nSince then, he\u2019s made petty comments to me. Things such as \u201coh, did you actually do anything on your shift?\u201d as I\u2019m leaving our store, etc. \n\nIn retrospect, I shouldn\u2019t have given him that much notice. I only did because I thought he\u2019d be cool, as he\u2019d voiced his support to me in the past. Now I\u2019m debating if I should even finish this last work week out, as friends/coworkers are telling me that he makes petty comments about me when I\u2019m not there. \n\nWhat do you think? Thanks all! \n\nUpdate:\n\nI made an update as a comment, but just figured I\u2019d post in the main body now. After showing up to work today, one of my coworkers filled me in on some of the petty things my manager said about me before I arrived. I\u2019ve decided that tomorrow will be my final shift. When my shift is over, I\u2019ll be leaving my keys & everything else with a quick text to my manager letting him know I\u2019m done. After, I plan on blocking him. Only reason I\u2019m sticking out for tomorrow\u2019s shift is out of courtesy to my coworker who I\u2019m relieving. ",

        "text": "I work in a small warehouse with two full-time employees and me as a part-time working student. Until recently, I did most of the physical labor while the full-timers handled admin tasks.\n\nAfter one guy left, the company hired someone new to take over my physical tasks and some related admin work. I transitioned into the remaining, more complex admin tasks since I already had the product knowledge. I trained him for about two months\u2014covering my old tasks, his new ones, and even parts of my new responsibilities so he could cover me when I\u2019m out.\n\nMy training for the new tasks took only 3 days, and I usually finish them pretty quickly. Since there wasn\u2019t a clear line between our roles, I\u2019d always help him with his tasks once I was done.\n\nThen I took a day off\u2014and when I returned, he just kept doing my tasks, claiming it was more efficient if he finished them before I got in, so we could then \u201cwork together\u201d on his stuff (which he clearly prefers\u2014less physical work). \n\nI talked to our boss, and yesterday she finally created a clear task division between us. Since then, he\u2019s been visibly upset. Now he\u2019s letting his own tasks pile up, probably hoping to complain that I\u2019m not helping, so I\u2019ll be forced back into supporting him.\n\nOur boss knows I finish my work fast and used to help him regularly. She asked me to help when necessary, but she\u2019s also aware that I used to do most of his job part-time.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m just watching him sabotage himself, hoping it becomes clear that he\u2019s creating a problem to get out of physical work.\n\nAny advice on how to handle this without escalating things myself? Would you intervene or let him dig his own hole?\n\nAlso since he basically does preparatory work for me I am constantly worried that he will just incorporate stupid mistakes to make my job harder or straight up sabotage my work.\n\nOverall its kind of frustrating that I have to put up with all this as a fking part time working student. Should I just do my tasks and if there are any issues just communicate to my boss and stop caring?",

        "text": "My boss is an extremely neurotic man. He walks around the office like the world is ending, comes up with things for me to do seemingly on impulse, and forgets things as quickly as he brings them up. Whenever we have someone important visiting or any other office event we need to be ready for, he worries about fixing up the place like royalty is coming. And he makes it all my problem. I'm the receptionist where I work, but I'm also the resident recipient of all of my office's \"odd jobs\" so to speak\u2013 I handle all our mail, make sure the place is tidy, run the dishwasher + stock the bathrooms, take out our trash, pick up/drop off stuff to other companies that we work with, order all our supplies, etc. I also do some more typical corporate work involving spreadsheets and Salesforce and the like.\n\nFor over a year now, my boss has been apparently finding reasons to get upset with me. He's gotten upset with me for: not taking out the trash when someone threw out something sour after my shift ended, not restocking the paper towels in the kitchen immediately after he used the last one, not restocking the toilet paper in the bathroom immediately after he used the last of it, other people putting dishes in the sink instead of the dishwasher when the dishwasher is empty, not noticing a lightbulb went out in a part of the office I rarely go to, and countless other equally petty stuff. I've tried to explain to him how these things are usually out of my control or are things I would've gotten to if he'd given me like, two minutes, but it just doesn't seem to get through to him.\n\nHe also seemingly pulls tasks out of his ass for me to do, especially when he sees I'm not immediately busy. I like to draw when it's not super busy at work, and he's told me in the past that he really doesn't mind at all that I do it, but in the past couple of months I've noticed that without fail, whenever he walks into the common area and sees me drawing, he follows it up with some weird request for me (saying we should clean out the fridge, suddenly deciding he wants to throw out a ton of books and I need to do it, walking into the room, saying \"it's dark in here\" and then telling me to go screw a lightbulb into a previously unused light, and all of these were in the past week or two).\n\nThis morning I came in to a Slack message from him asking why I didn't run the dishwasher yesterday. I told him we haven't needed to run it daily since another company on our floor moved out and there's been less people and less dishes since then. He again didn't seem to register any of it and said he's tired of having to tell me this (he doesn't, I was already going to run the dishwasher as soon as I notice it's full, I have no clue why he doesn't seem to trust me to do so). He says he wants to have a talk with me tomorrow, and I'm dreading it so bad.\n\nI don't come to work to be chastised like I'm in the principal's office again, and I've grown really really tired of him, but I'm also hesitant to start looking for other work (believe it or not, there are things I do really like about this job) and even if I wanted to, I know the job market is and has been a nightmare. I don't really want to throw myself back into the search if I don't have to (especially since I'm moving in just over a week), but my boss is really making it hard to want to stay here\u2013 if he doesn't just fire me outright eventually.\n\nI don't really know what advice might help here because I doubt he'll listen to reason, but I feel completely lost. I don't know how to proceed from here. Do I just try to be 150% on top of everything to try and avoid his attention, or will he just move the goalposts? Should I try to assert myself to him tomorrow or is that just going to get me fired? Should I start looking for another place to work? Is there any way I can change his mind? Should I just try not to let him bother me? I'm really at a loss. Any advice helps.",

        "text": "Hello Reddit!! I\u2019m just coming down from a meltdown so if something is confusing or unclear, I\u2019d be happy to answer questions in the comments. Im a little scattered brained too but I\u2019m going to try to be concise. \n\nAlso quick content warning for Vomiting for any queasy folks out there! \n\nSo I, 19F have been working at an international coffee chain for a little over a year. I have to admit, I\u2019ve had issues with calling out too frequently or on days that inconvenience our staff and manager. Im aware it doesn\u2019t make a difference, my absence is still an issue, but I\u2019ve been struggling with CVS (cyclical vomiting syndrome)  \n\nBasically in the mornings and when I\u2019m super stressed out (sometimes more than just that- it comes and goes in waves) I get super nauseous and will frequently have to rush to the restroom or nearest trash can to throw up. Sometimes I feel fine afterwards and will go to work anyways or I will push myself to go to work because I\u2019ve already called out too many times, they need me on the schedule, or it\u2019s a holiday/product launch. \n\nI frequently go to work sick and nauseous, half the time when I do call out my manager will push me to go in anyway. Especially if I didn\u2019t start getting sick 3 hours before the shift, that\u2019s our calling in stipulation. More times than not i will still go in because I feel guilty, even if that means having to throw up in the work bathroom multiple times a shift. It\u2019s something I just have to put up with, and it sucks. Sometimes I can\u2019t just put up with it and I have to convince my manager it\u2019s not one of the power through days. \n\nI\u2019ve had a many of discussion with my Management about this and I\u2019ve had to procure 3 doctors notes within the past year so I don\u2019t get fired. I\u2019ve already been written up once for calling out. \nTo get an idea of the frequency, within a month I will have probably called in 3 times, 2 of which I will just go in later than my original shift time. I also usually work 36-40 hours weekly. \n\nI feel I should also mention, I\u2019ve never once called in when I wasn\u2019t sick. I\u2019ve never taken a mental health day (even though there are days I wish I fuckin could man) and I\u2019ve never just tried to get out of work to have the day off. \n\nNow that\u2019s all cleared up, onto this morning. \n\nI was scheduled from 8am-4pm. I woke up at like 7:15 and immediately had to vom, my head is also pounding because of an ear infection I have. Off the bat, not off to a great start but I have to be at work in 45 minutes. After the third time with my throbbing head hung over my toilet, i decided to check the schedule to see if I could find somebody to cover for me. We have to find coverage if it\u2019s not 3 hours before a shift. \n(I also always offer to buy who ever covers for me a meal, coffee, snack for the covered shift and take one of theirs if it aligns with my next day off) \nSo literally everybody at work is either out of town or only has the one day off. \n\nMy manager was off today and she had been yesterday as well so I called her. My phone service was having problems so I wifi called her twice, used my mom\u2019s phone twice, used the family business phone, and still no answer. I also tried our assistant manager. \n\nI called the store to let them know I was trying desperately to get a hold of our manager, not only to cover but I would need to tell her as well that I wouldn\u2019t be going in. \nI\u2019m now sobbing and panicking because I know I can\u2019t take showing up to work, my head is spinning, I\u2019m sobbing, vomiting, and hyperventilating in rapid intervals. My coworker who answered is a saint, she assured me that they weren\u2019t going to struggle without me and offered to try to get in touch with management. No luck there. \n\nMy uncle works on the grocery store side of things, he tried to get in touch with the store managers to let him know we couldn\u2019t contact coffee place management. They also arent in today. \n\nI started freaking out more because it\u2019s 10 past when I needed to be there. I was panicking and sobbing so hard that my uncle went ahead and told coffee house that I wouldn\u2019t be going in today despite not contacting management or finding a replacement. \n\nThe store called back like an hour ago (not my direct managers, just the store)  and said dont even worry about having a doctors note because they are going to consider this a no call no show and I\u2019ll have to sign a write up and have a disciplinary meeting. \n\nI\u2019ve already accepted that over the past hour, but I\u2019m just sick, tired, and frustrated. With myself and my management. \n\nI know this is the result of my choice not to just go in today after not getting a hold of anybody, but I am in no condition to be on my feet for 8 hours and dealing with just everything else. It\u2019s been hell here for a moment. we\u2019ve got people quitting; one of which who does like 50% of my managers job even though he\u2019s not the assistant manager. My manager also has been fucking me over by not supplying our food items and putting them in defrost when opening shift is supposed to leaving it for me in the evening doubling my work load, scheduling me one day off for two weeks by making me work bullshit hours, guilt tripping me any time I\u2019ve asked for days off or to come in even after I\u2019ve told her I\u2019ve been consecutively sick, scheduling me by myself to close on weekends when it\u2019s busy, releasing the new schedule on the last day of the old leaving the upcoming work schedule a mystery untill the day before. \n\nThis feels like my last straw, but I know this is just a consequence of calling out too late. I feel like a winey little bitch. \n\nI\u2019m frustrated, with myself and with my management. I don\u2019t know if I should contest the write up, just take it and move on, or just put in my two weeks and find something different. Any and all advice is appreciated!! Please reality check me, if that\u2019s what I need. \nLet me know what yall would do if you were in my position, I don\u2019t know how I should deal with this.

He falls asleep at his desk because he plays all night and wakes up whrn a client calls and does the work okayish. \n\nI organised a meeting 4 times, he only showed up once and his part of the work wasn't done he didn't want my help he wanted to ask a male. Nobody helped him. The work isn't there and my boss is driving me crazy he doesn't see that the boy might have adhd or something he lacks motivation (I have adhd and autism).\n\n\n\n",

After the meeting ended, he DMed me on slack, said hi and asked how I'm doing and where I'm from, and I responded neutrally. Then he said I look \"so cute and young.\" \n\nI feel creeped out and don't really know what to do. He's not some 65-year-old man or something, he's maybe 25-30, but I'm not interested in dating a coworker and I don't know this guy. It was really out of the blue and random. Should I just stop responding and ignore it? This is my first real job and this is the first time something like this has happened to me, so I don't know what to do",

I emailed to confirm it was still open and when they said yes I applied 10 days ago. They emailed me and confirmed they got my application two days ago but seven days ago (three days after my initial app) they posted the job application on LinkedIn. Feeling super discouraged. I\u2019m almost exactly qualified for the job so was feeling hopeful but now seeing them post the job application makes me think they got my job application and it was so bad they decided they needed to encourage another candidate lol. Is it possible they just wanted to get some more interest / competition so they had choice between me and others, or do you think this is a super bad sign? I also was discouraged that it took them like a week (there was a stat holiday during that time ) to confirm my application idk if that means bad things too\n\nJust overall so discouraged , I\u2019m absolutely trapped in a toxic work place and desperately want to take the next step in my career",

We work in a shared open office and deal with everything helpdesk through to back end infrastructure, networking, cloud etc\u2026\n\nOver the past couple of years it has become almost unbearable at times, we\u2019ve lost key people and have had a newbie start at the bottom and the key people\u2019s responsibilities have been distributed amongst the top end.  We are now in a situation where our \u201csenior\u201d sys admin (self-proclaimed) grandstands in front of the office and spends hours talking about how busy he is while having possibly the lightest workload in the room and has been painfully slow to deliver projects which should take significantly less time.  He\u2019s made it clear that he won\u2019t be taking on additional tasks that fit within his scope and is fully aware that means other people have to.\n\nPerson 2 will draw the attention of the entire office and loop the shit out of little insignificant things for hours at a time, multiple times a day, mostly which don\u2019t affect him and actively refuses to do his job duties.\n\nI come home mentally drained every day.

        "post-author": "Indiction",
        "text": "So, I'm in a bit of a bleh situation. We're a 3 member IT department, including my boss. When my other coworker is there, I don't feel the workload as much because we equally everything between us two. My issue is that our boss just...doesn't do anything. He's on personal calls, tiktok, etc., and contributes minimally all day, every day. \n\nThis is even worse when my coworker is gone, because he now seems to just take advantage of me and does absolutely zero. I'm talking no calls taken, no emails answered, no tasks, nothing. Just relies on me to do everything. \n\nI know a big thing is communicating this whole situation to him, but I, truthfully, don't think I can. He's very defensive, the big type of guy that thinks louder = he's right, will absolutely swear he's not said this or that. You get the point, generally very unapproachable.\n\nI'm really just not sure how to approach his brute/lazy personality self. I'm not the confrontational type to begin with, but I will speak to a person if I feel like I can. I just don't feel like I can approach him.\n\nI'm generally a happy/low maintenance worker. I'm on top of my tasks, I do good work, and I can take over solo if I need to, I just shouldn't have to. I really don't want my level of work to be affected, but I don't know how to force him to contribute without outright ignoring some of my duties (so he takes over), while I do some other duties at a slower pace instead. I don't feel like it's my place to tell him to work, he's MY boss after all, but I also don't think he will work until you tell him to. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated. If any details needed, just ask, happy to add. ",

                        "body": "Absolutely, I can elaborate. The only reason I know what he\u2019s doing is because we all share a relatively smaller office. We hear his videos, we hear all his calls, he\u2019s got non-existent ticket numbers. He won\u2019t even reply to emails addressed specifically to him. Basically, all our work resources are shared amongst us 3, so we can all see when there\u2019s a discrepancy.\n\nI want to communicate this to him, trust me. He\u2019s very volatile and gets worked up quickly. He\u2019s unapproachable even to my other coworker and even to his superiors. He\u2019ll start raising his voice to our ED same as us, it\u2019s all the same. How he gets away with that is above my pay grade.\n\nAs far as tasks go, because we\u2019re such a small department, we\u2019re all equally in charge of things such as tickets, emails, calls, etc. standard helpdesk stuff. My coworker deals more with billing IT, I handle the higher tier stuff usually, and supervisor is supposed to do same things I do, according to our ED. Supervisor doesn\u2019t get handed a lot of managerial duties besides time cards and just making sure things get done. Again, I only know this because he doesn\u2019t do his higher duties on time/doesn\u2019t reply, so we get tasked with making sure he gets stuff done by our ED (his supervisor).\n\nMy tasks pretty much include everything we do at the helpdesk, including assisting my coworker with her more technical side of billing. I\u2019m involved in everything from equipment to accounts for everything to billing. It\u2019s a lot honestly. Supervisor has, unfortunately, gotten to the point where he doesn\u2019t know how to do any of my tasks if I\u2019m gone, doesn\u2019t know where to check for anything, etc. My workload is pretty hefty, but my work is honest. My reputation with my ED speaks for itself, and she\u2019s been happy enough to double my wage in the time I\u2019ve been here.\n\nWorkloads between my coworker and I are great, she helps a ton and I notice her absence, and she notices mine. We work great together, and we\u2019re respectful of each others duties and what we\u2019ve got going on. No issue here.\n\nSo the main thing I think I forgot to stress in the original email is that, yes, he\u2019s my supervisor, but because we\u2019re are such a smaller team, the tasks have been assigned and should fall equally as per our ED.\n\nWhat I mean by \u201cforce\u201d him to contribute is that I focus on important tasks that I need to do, and I don\u2019t interrupt that by answering phones/emails for a time (essentially \u201cforcing\u201d him to answer calls or emails). I hope that didn\u2019t come off as malicious.",

Do the amount of work you can in a day. Anything else is his problem.\n\nEqually, if the issue is actually just that you're pissed that he's not working on the tickets with you - managers aren't always supposed to be getting involved with IC work unless it's needed to support the workload. Do you know for sure he's not working on stuff that's less visible to you, like reporting on stats for the team, working on comp plans and performance reviews, building leadership skills etc? Or are you assuming because he's not doing tickets or taking calls with customers that he's not doing any work?",

It does bother me when the work isn\u2019t completed, because I just like to do well, but I don\u2019t get super hung up on it.\n\nBecause our company and team are smaller, our ED has let us know that, at baseline, we\u2019re all equally in charge of certain core tasks like tickets, emails, and calls. He does have a few managerial duties beyond that, but my coworker and I are often tasked with reminding him and making sure he does/follows up with those tasks. So at the very least we know he\u2019s also not doing his managerial duties either. The core, shared duties all have shared resources, so we know who is doing what, and unfortunately he also falls short on that.\n\nIt\u2019s a very small office, so what we all do is seen and heard. I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, but his hours-long personal calls and constant TikTok videos from his office are\u2026irritating at the very least with our workload.

There have been issues the whole time I\u2019ve worked there: she spends hours of every day in my managers office which leaves me to deal with all incoming calls and everyone that comes into the office (we work in an apartment complex office), and pushes off any work on to me that doesn\u2019t involve commission (on-site transfers, current residents with complex issues, etc.), and just often has a negative overall attitude towards everyone besides her friend aka our boss. I\u2019ve tried to address parts of this, but nothing has ever changed. The other day, this all escalated and she yelled at the assistant manager in an aggressive manner for at least a few minutes (the reason why was not necessarily important, it was mostly a misunderstanding/him thinking he was helping), then she decided to leave early. My manager is still on her friends side, because she\u2019s blind to all the issues her friend causes. I emailed my higher up today, and she\u2019s coming to the complex tomorrow for an unrelated visit, but she said we\u2019ll discuss the issue. The assistant manager has already talked to the higher up as well. I just want the office to be a fair and comfortable environment - what should I say when I talk to the higher up?",

Their job is very physical and requires a lot of bending, twisting, and lifting. It is also roughly 7 hours on your feet nornally.\n\nRather than adjust their duties to wfh (which is a possibility in my friends roll) their boss requested they return to work ASAP. He then called their doctor to try get more information about their condition and make a plan for sooner return to work than 4+ weeks. \n\nThe doctor's office immediately notified my friend that their boss had called and asked questions that would have violated their HIPAA rights if they had answered them, so they were obviously taken aback and refused to answer. The doctor's office said they had never experience something like this before. Normally employers understand very well they are only allowed to verify the authenticity of the note and the dates it is for. \n\nMy friend was very forthcoming with their issues and had already told them exactly what was wrong with them at this point, but I guess their boss doesn't believe them.\n\nThey made a plan with work to get a mobility device, and a boot and attempt to return to work against the doctors orders and medical advice to stay in bed and keep it elevated. So far my friend has worked 2 days back since breaking their toe and getting their mobility device.\n\nMy friend is, obviously, not really able to carry out their duties at work on their mobility device. They require coworkers to do almost all of their work for them. On top of this being present and using the mobility device for 8 hours a day is giving them terrible hip and knee pain. They are worried by the time the toe is healed they will have more injuried from the mobility device they chose. They shared their concerns with their boss.\n\nTheir boss has emailed them twice since they left work last night pressuring them to buy themself a wheel chair as well as their current mobility device (this would not fit in the coworker's car who has been nice enough to offer rides alone - and they would need both). Insurance obviously wont cover a wheelchair for a broken toe especially because they already covered a mobility device.\n\nMy friend has worked here for many years and taken less than 2 weeks of sick time off in total since they started. 10 days of that was for a freakish disease (these things happen) some years ago. They have the maximum 14 days sick time banked currently.\n\nI am at my wits end trying to help my friend navigate this situation. They are currently getting ready for work, but my current plan is to sit down with them when the doctor opens and call the physician. I'm going to tell them what's going on with my friend and that their work refused to adjust their duties based on their medical advice and see if they think a medical leave of absence is appropriate for this condition. \n\nAny advice on how we should handle this situation is welcome.",

Once back if your friend is in an \u201cat will\u201d state they will make up some reason to fire him. So I would also reach out to an employment lawyer or in legal advice on Reddit when you do include the state your friend is in for more accurate help",

So the advice you get will vary wildly here, depending on the locale.  I'm in the US, so that's the perspective that I'm taking here.\n\nOne, the employer isn't mandated to change your friend's job duties to be light duty or WFH for a non-work injury.  You don't really say whether or not this was a work injury, but since you didn't mention worker's comp anywhere, I just assumed it was a non-work injury.  So for that, the employer is allowed to say that your friend can either come in and do their job, or just stay home if they are too injured to do their job.  Don't get me wrong.  It would be more compassionate to allow your friend to work from home if that's feasible for their job role.  But it's not mandatory for the employer to do it.  They are allowed to refuse to adjust your friend's duties when they have a non-work injury.\n\nThe employer was out of line for calling the doc.  But the doc rightfully shut them down.\n\nThe employer is probably out of line for telling your friend to buy a wheelchair.  Work doesn't have to buy one for your friend, if this is a non-work injury.  But they also shouldn't be pressuring your friend to buy one, either.  On the flip side, if the alternative is that your friend cannot work for a month or more, would any potential lost wages offset the cost of buying a wheelchair?  This is a case where the employer might be out of line, but that doesn't mean their suggestion is pure shit.  If your friend must go to work to get paid, and the only way they can go to work is to have a wheelchair, then they might be better off buying the wheelchair if it's not crazy expensive.  But obviously if they have access to paid leave, that's better.",

The employer is taking a stance that they have to show up onsight and complete their duties regardless of the injury and doctors note. Which is why I am going to call the physician with my friend and see if they would support a medical leave for this condition. Clearly returning to work with a mobility device has not gone the way the employer hoped, and instead of being realistic at that point is looking for more \"bandaids\" to slap in the problem and they are pressuring my friend to do anythinf but stay home and rest per doctors orders.",

That would be job protected leave.  \n\nIf your friend has protected sick time that the employer is refusing to allow them to use, that's another story.

They should also not drive in it or wear it at home. Just when they have to like work or errands.

We were set to collaborate for this project, and i mesaged and told her we could book a room to do some collaboration and brainstorming together. she agreed to this, and I asked her what time works for her, and we also agreed on a time.\n\nShe sent me a file which she said we could use to collaborate and place our ideas, and tonight i opened the file, and its so full. she already added up to 30 differnt ideas and designs and even did the research as well. I thought this was very nice, but felt some type of way because i thought we were going to do the brainstorming together. She always takes initiative by creating ways for us interns to organize our work. if we are given a project for example, she would email us all and send maybe a figjam or figma board for us to place all our ideas. Which is always really helpful. But there never really is a point where she asks us to come together to decide how we might want to present, if everyone is onboard, etc.\n\nI think the other interns are feeling overwhelmed by it, although i appreciate it.\n\nwith this project now, im unsure how we would collaborate and brainstorm as it seems shes already done most of the work. Theres about 21 sketches, shes done the research, wrote out the task, and placed the visual and colour guides. I find this helpful to kick off the meeting, but I honestly feel some type of way and im unsure why.\n\nIm open to advice here, maybe I'm not taking initiative enough.\n\n",

        "post-author": "Typical_Guest8829",
        "text": "Hello,  I\u2019m a higher level healthcare worker with responsibility for a large range of tasks. I work with one other colleague who is at the same level. \n\nIn the past, we had shared tasks that needed to be done weekly. My colleague works in a different location because it suits them for their commute and they needed to travel for the shared tasks (responding to queries and a weekly meeting). My colleague would frequently complain about the meeting  and having to deal with queries and I offered to take on responsibility for it going forward. They were delighted & agreed to focus on another aspect of work. \n\nThis was working fine initially but then it seemed to irritate them that people would come to me as a point of contact. Over time, because I\u2019m in a more central work location and attend the weekly meeting, general queries tended to be directed to me and not my colleague. Wherever I could, I consulted with them before responding so we could both be involved. I set up a central email contact for us both so that they could also be involved. I also brought the issue to my our manager to ensure it was clear I was not trying to make myself the \u201clead\u201d and requested that they please give me feedback if it ever came across that way. I also asked my manager to please send queries and opportunities to us both rather than just to me. Still my colleague was frustrated that others would come to me first over them. Eventually, they became angry and said they were coming back to the shared meeting but this never materialised and about a week later they changed their mind and said they liked things the way they were:\n\nJust a few weeks later, my colleague started to raise complaints about decisions I\u2019d made at the meetings that they chose not to attend. But when I would ask if they felt I\u2019d made the wrong decision & in that case, should become involved in decision making again, they declined. This pattern continued for a while, with them complaining, sending very demanding emails requesting lots of information and then eventually apologising and citing something personal impacting on them. I tended to take on the role of soothing and over apologising, but in reality, I couldn\u2019t really see what I had done wrong and I was just trying to de-escalate. \n\nIt\u2019s hit a peak now. A different colleague asked me to lead out on something I have a special interest in (and my colleague has said they  were not interested in) and I said yes. I let my other colleague know and they were very unhappy they weren\u2019t also asked, they said they wanted to lead out. I was so upset. I pulled out of the project and let them take the lead. The next day, they changed their mind because they don\u2019t have time to do it. Now, they seem to be stuck in the irritated mood that they normally come out of and they\u2019re trying to pull out of previously agreed shared meetings with clients.\n\nI do have a meeting arranged with my manager to discuss. I\u2019m aware we\u2019re all adults and I\u2019d love nothing more than to just come to work, do my work and not have to try and keep calming the situation down. My goal is to ask my manager if I can have guidance on how to communicate better with my colleague and get us out of this mode. I feel really disloyal bringing this to my manager because there are times my colleague is very nice and caring. I\u2019m also aware I\u2019m quite a perfectionist and too detail focused and that\u2019s equally hard to work with at times. Equally, I\u2019m not sure how I can do my work if I have to second guess every opportunity or decision I make because I\u2019m wondering what fallout it will bring from my colleague. \n\nIf you\u2019re still reading this, I\u2019d love your thoughts. If this is just something to suck up and get on with, I will! Equally, an unbiased view would be great. Thanks ",

(All my time off/paperwork followed company policy) During the time I was out, our group of 7 people went out for lunch as a group to welcome our new boss. When my coworkers questioned where I was, newbie supervisor announced to everyone that I was on bereavement leave, \u201csupposedly.\u201d Multiple coworkers told me he said this, we\u2019re a close knit group of people who have been working together for nearly a decades, I trust they aren\u2019t making it up. It rubbed me the wrong way as the guy doesn\u2019t even know me yet he assumes I\u2019m making up a family member passing away. Had he asked for proof, I was ready to show it to him. Instead he\u2019s sarcastic about it when talking about it to my peers. It\u2019s something I want to speak up about but do I have a leg to stand on as it\u2019s technically hearsay? I don\u2019t want to open a can of worms and it ends up involving my coworkers. \n\nThis new guy has only been managing us for less than a month.

To the new person, they misguidedly think their entire value lies in making change and driving improvements. Just maintaining a good status quo is not enough, in their minds. So naturally everything associated with the old manager looks like a problem that needs fixing.  You, unfortunately, are falling into that category. It's likely that he's picked up on your distaste for him, or you've expressed disagreement about the changes he's making. Whatever the reason, he may see you as an antagonist rather than someone who can help him bring about the improvements he wants.  \n\nIf you don't want that to be a permanent condition (which may lead to your termination,) you are going to have to change what you say to him and how you say it. \n\nThis could just be a bridge to a better relationship when you've built up a mutual trust and he relaxes his scrutiny-- or it's a way to buy time so you can look for the perfect new job and leave this bozo behind.  But no matter what, and no matter how unfair, the burden to change is on you. Don't expect him to change.  \n\nGet your resume together and start sending it out to other companies who are hiring.  Accept any invitations to interview even if the job isn't all that appealing--interviewing is a skill that you need to practice alot before you get good at it.

I am part of the administrative staff, and in our work place there should ideally be three of us. Another co-worker retired about 16 months ago, and since then we have operated primarily on 2, sometimes having a third who we are training\u2026just for them to ultimately leave. Since we are usually 2, i.e. understaffed, my supervisor has told us during these times that we were not supposed to use our PTO, because there is no one who can cover us. This bullshit is one of many reasons I hate this goddamn company and am seriously applying myself to get out of dodge. My hang up is my number 2, my co-worker who I have genuinely come to love and view as a friend. How do I tell her I am planning on leaving, and what is my co-worker to co-worker obligation to let her know? ",

I already had a few good offers in hand, and just had a couple more interviews to do before I made my decision, plus the company I really wanted to work for hadn't given me an offer yet. My manager initially seemed okay with it, thanking me for helping make the transition smooth. But he never even interviewed any candidates to replace me so I could train them. One day he stopped at my desk and angrily told me I had to tell him how much longer I was going to be there. Then I was kicked out of a meeting and uninvited from future meetings, which I found out through the grapevine was because the manager was paranoid that I was going to use information from those meetings to help my future employer. Fine, whatever. I finally got the offer from the company I wanted to work for, and put in my two weeks notice. By then the manager was blatantly hostile toward me. I offered to use up the rest of my PTO instead of coming in, and he agreed that would be best. So I got a week and a half off (which I needed anyway) before starting my new job. We always had a going-away lunch for anyone who was leaving, but the manager explicitly forbade the team from arranging one for me. Fortunately most of my co-workers ignored him and arranged one anyway.\n\nAfter that I never gave any employer more than two weeks notice.",

During interview was promised mentorship, training, and promotion to PM after a year, as long as I'm not an idiot. I'm 9 months in. I've yet to be trained on anything. My boss tosses me tasks for various jobs with no explanation, and gives me about 1/4 of the information needed to complete the task. \n\nExample: \"Get this job and phase set up in payroll\". He doesn't give me any client POs, contracts, drawings, or anything related to the job, knowing full well I need to know if it's fixed fee, t&m, how much, materials needed, employees on site, site location. Then proceeds to take forever to answer my questions and is visibly annoyed I'm asking them. \n\nDuring my one review I was told, \"you ask too many questions and don't have enough confidence in your descisions.\" I responded by telling him a version of what I just wrote as an example of why I ask questions, and further explained that I've never been given any authority to make decisions. (He's openly stated he is a micro manager, but also gets mad when you ask something) \n\nHe then went on to say that he will give me a doc of my scope of work and authority. He never did, but he's also said a million things he never actually does, unless it sucks then he makes sure it happens. He also said we will train more. That consisted of me driving to the office for 2 weeks to do the same thing I do from home, with him on the other side of the building. \n\nLong story long again, idk what to do. Honestly wanna just find another job but don't wanna look like a job hopper. I feel like nothing that was said in the interview has happened, and my year mark will end with a 50 cent raise. I do alot, not just saying that. Our field superintendent recentally told me my job is apparently to do everything so the PM gets paid to go fishing. Lol but my PM speaks as if I don't do much. \n\nI've learned alot but it's all been trial by fire, as he's never taught me anything. \"Put together a proposal page.\" (Never been shown how, try my best and get corrected. Proceed to remember correction.) That may be some people's idea of training, idk. \n\nAnyway, I've expressed these things to him and simply nothing changes. He also makes it very clear he couldn't care less about the field guys, so I doubt he cares much for me either. He's best friends with the owner so I doubt he's going anywhere. \n\nAm I being dramatic, or is this how office gigs typically work? I've always just been the dude in the trench with a rotary laser, so idk. My foreman yelled at me when I was new, but only because I messed something up they trained me on lol they didn't expect me to set grade before showing me how to work a story pole. \n\nLol, anyway, any advice? \n\nTLDR: My boss is a micromanaging boss, but doesn't train or do what was promised.

        "post-author": "Natural-Aspect7057",
        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI do in-house marketing at a company and have been here for a few years. One of my teammates, we\u2019ll call her Taylor is 23 which is 5 years younger than me (this is kinda relevant to me because most people in my country graduate around that age so they wouldn't have more than intern experience out of the gate but she's from a different country so she had like 6 years somehow). Anyway, because of that we're at about the same level, and she actually told me her salary for some reason, but it's the same as mine. That\u2019s not really the issue though.\n\nWe used to be pretty close, lunch breaks together, shared personal stuff, even went to a concert last year and have another one planned next month. I genuinely thought we were friends.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, she started acting cold. No obvious incident triggered it, though looking back, it was sometime after performance reviews earlier this year. She suddenly stopped talking to me, started avoiding me in meetings, and now mostly socializes with other coworkers. It feels deliberate and hurtful, especially since I\u2019ve always tried to be kind, upfront, and supportive.\n\nShe\u2019s also extremely competitive. She constantly talks about promotions and job-hunting, and while I\u2019m not naturally competitive, I did start asking about a promotion myself (I\u2019ve been here longer). She found out someone else had asked and cornered me about it, I didn\u2019t confirm, but it was pretty obvious. Beyond that, I recently found out that the person she somewhat works under, a more senior competent colleague with a higher title has even complained about her saying he thinks she\u2019s trying to angle for his job.\n\nWe\u2019ve also had a few moments of professional tension. She started stepping into projects I was already handling. My boss now checks with me before assigning her anything on my plate, which helps, but it created an odd dynamic. And when we do work together, she tends to take over and present it like she did everything. I get a quick mention at the beginning, and that\u2019s it. Then everyone's saying her work is sooo great meanwhile I was part of the brain behind it. I\u2019m actively job hunting because this environment is draining, but I still have to deal with her in the meantime.\n\nOn top of that, we\u2019ve got this concert next month. I want to go (I love the artist and wouldn't miss that for anything), but I haven\u2019t paid her back yet for the ticket she bought last year as we've agreed to do the exchange closer to the date due to ticket transferring and stuff. I\u2019ve been putting it off to ask to do it because things feel so weird, I was going to ask her but she left for vacation and now that she's back she's still being weird. Another friend she's bringing to the concert she didn't even want to introduce me to and she had several opportunities (she used to pass on lunch with me to go and take her out). That's no prob of course but if it were me I would want my friends to maybe meet ahead of the concert? When I go, I know I will likely be third wheeled but that's ok. I just don't want this bs at the office.\n\nSo I don\u2019t know if I should I confront her? Let it go? I feel sick even thinking about it. I don\u2019t think I should feel this way about a friend, but I really feel like I\u2019ve been totally dropped. I don\u2019t mind that she\u2019s ambitious but I do mind feeling stepped on and iced out in the process.\n\nAny advice?\n\nTL;DR: Coworker/friend suddenly started ignoring me after we got close. No clear reason, but now she\u2019s icing me out at work and socially, and we have a concert coming up. Not sure if I should confront her or just ignore it.",

        "text": "I work for a state government agency, quite far from my family. My job is extremely strict about everything, but especially travel. Recently, I went on a work trip that was a 2.5 hour drive away from my family. I was told I could not deviate and take the weekend to see them, even if I paid for my own flight back home. \n\nDespite this, a colleague from our same agency but at a different location, was allowed to deviate and take a personal vacation after our work trip. This devastated me. I feel that I have lazy management who do not advocate for me and I have been unable to find the rules on my own. I have expressed my frustration to my direct supervisor and asked if he talked to the boss above him, but he hasn\u2019t yet. \n\nNow I am in a similar situation. I was submitting travel for a second work trip for my first time, and the process is so strict, it kept getting bounced back. I was also getting \u201ckindly\u201d talked to several times by higher-ups. So, basically, people were already frustrated with me and the process. During one of the times I needed to restart my travel packet, my family and I received notice that my husband would be honored at a work event on the Saturday I return. I asked my supervisor if I can change my requested flights so I can be home in time. He said we can\u2019t, that everyone will be more angry, and that we never get the first flights we request anyways. Unfortunately, I did get the first flight I requested and I\u2019ll be landing at midnight, long after my husband\u2019s work event is over. \n\nI feel extremely frustrated and am tired of being overlooked. I am eager at the opportunity to learn, but they are taking up my weekends, personal time, and family time. In addition, we do not receive compensation for travel on weekends, because apparently someone took advantage of putting in comp hours before, so we lost the privilege entirely. This is another rule I can\u2019t find written anywhere. \n\nI should possibly mention this is one of my first \u201creal\u201d jobs and I am the youngest person in this office by far, so while I don\u2019t think anyone has bad intentions, I do think it\u2019s possible they\u2019re able to take more advantage of me. I also feel that I\u2019m not going through the proper channels to learn the rules or complain. They make me feel as if I\u2019m causing trouble just to try to see my family on a weekend. \n\nI am looking for any general advice, but I have two main questions: \n\n1. Is there any way I can try to get on an earlier flight without getting in trouble? As it stands now, I have 4 hours between hotel check out time and being at the airport, in a city I don\u2019t feel very comfortable being in alone. \n\n2. Where can I find written rules for travel? Is it through HR? At this point it\u2019s clear no one is helping me out. \n\nThank you for reading. This job is frustrating for a multitude of reasons but I\u2019m feeling completely disregarded. ",

However i am tired \n\ni have asked for Tuesday(yesterday 5/20) off and i believe another day prior to that this month on a friday. but the next week i was called in for overtime which i accepted. I do have PTO. My question is that i asked for Saturday off to be let off at 330. My shift ends at 645 and we have 12 hour shifts. However our team is short now because one of our med techs quit yesterday so my boss never got back to me. I WANT to work until 330. i don\u2019t want the whole day off and it does feel wrong but i know if i bring it up again she\u2019s most likely going to say no. I want off to go to a wedding btw. But i have decided if she doesn\u2019t respond i will just call out Saturday. yes this leaves my team in a bad spot but im not sure if this is the right decision. i feel bad due to it being a healthcare job but i also want to live my life. any advice? \n\n\ntoo also add in some context me and the other med tech have had some issues lately ",

Tell them and don't ask them, you're going to this wedding, and you need to be out at 330.  It's up to your boss to figure out the rest of the day. I've passed up some great stuff in the past because i had to work. Wasted time working endless hours and not with a loved one who suddenly passed. When working i do my best most of the time. When i need time off i rarely ask if i can, i submit my form to my boss across from me and say I'll be off this day. This is your bosses fault for not having enough staff. I'm sure she can cover for you. If she has an issue, then that's her fault.",

It's not healthy always having work on your mind or worrying if you will be called in. I had that with a trucking company; I covered 4 different positions. I was on call 24/7, calls at 3am, calls on dates i had to answer. I was so stressed my doctor said it was messing with my heart and health. When I left, i got back to a normal 8-430 job m-f no calls after it's like i lost 1000 pounds in stress. Show you care but also take time for yourself and enjoy the wedding.",

He agreed, was very open and positive towards that idea, but did mention that he needed to check with HR if there's any formal way, as he's from completely different area of business.\n\nI followed up a week later, asking if there was any update from HR. He said not yet, HR were very slow in responding to him. Then I went on holiday for 3 weeks. Came back and didn't see any messages from him, so texted him again. This time it seems like he saw my message but hasn't responded in 3 days by now.\n\nSo I start to wonder a little if it would be appropriate to follow-up again in a week's time, or perhaps just let it be? I am very keen to get mentorship going, put some time in the diary etc., but at the same time slightly cautious that I also don't want to come around as too pushy.\n\nAny advice how/if to follow up again if he still doesn't respond?",

I also made another sheet that, based on the date you input, pulls all info+QR of everyone coming that date into a printable version they can easily out. \n\nThe owner also wanted to import like 30k contacts into his phone from our CRM, and I was able to do that for him too. \n\nNothing company changing, but if I had more access to company wide issue, I\u2019m sure I could solve a lot of problems or create a lot of new helpful ways of doing things.",

I\u2019d probably take it out of deployment and roll back development a bit so you can present it as a prototype. You can quickly solve the problems later and look like a genius more than once. Milk it for a lot of credit while also taking the opportunity to genuinely improve it with the input of others. A really smart tactic might be to lead others to some partial solutions here and there so that they feel included, invested and motivated to see their own contributions deployed. Then with a bunch of people rooting for you, because they stand to selfishly gain from your success, you can get this moving through the bureaucracy and build a bit of a coalition in which you get to be the leader.",

        "text": "I am secretly gender fluid at work and in public (In the closet if you will). I do not let my coworkers know this as I live in a very conservative area and it is better for me to keep it entirely to myself when it comes to work. I also work in a department with 58 men and 2 women \n\nRecently I had to use the restroom, very very badly... I ate something the didn't agree with my stomach. The closest restrooms to me is a double men's bathroom and a single women's bathroom which is lockable. Since I present as a man at work I use the man's restroom. I ran in. First potty is covered in poop with TP clogging the toilet. The next one over looked vile with poop stains all over the toilet. I couldn't do it. I run out all of a sudden I'm on the verge of literally pooping on myself. I try the handle to the ladies and it's unlocked I knock just to make sure. No answer. I run in lock the door and start pooping. Not 2 mins pass and there is a knock on the door. However I have it locked. Still, I say... occupied because I know there is a spare key for the just in case the door is accidentally locked moments. The person walks away. I guess they didn't hear me because the next thing I know I hear the key slide in and the handle turn I shout OCCUPIED. One of the two women in the department quickly closes the door and shouts... what are you doing in the women's restroom you creep. She then runs off and tells my Process leader while another operator was in the room. It spreads to 4-5 other people and the process leader now tells me he has to report it. They say this will likely get me fired as it created a hostile work environment. I have a meeting with the higher ups in the morning I'm sure. My company is huge on respecting gender identity as it is part of a global network under the same name. I'm thinking about telling the HR lady that I am gender fluid but that I want to keep it a secret to keep my job. Idk this situation is so weird and complicated. What should I do. Is it actually possible to get fired for this? I'm in South Carolina... idk if that information is necessary. Someone who knows something about this help me please!",

You might consider being dismayed, disgusted, annoyed, unamused, put out, and generally disappointed in the company's inability to maintain basic levels of civil standards in their offices. \n\nJust imagine what stakeholders might have to say if they knew that custodians were not being directed to maintain all areas at all times. Is this a budgetary issue? \n\nIs there a history of poor plumbing? What exactly is the cleaning schedule? How often is the cleaning schedule supervised? \n\nThe company's inability to provide a clean safe work environment put you in a position to make a choice that might upset some or cause yourself to be unable to maintain professionalism. What does the company plan to do to prevent this issue in the future? \n\nThis is just unacceptable. Don't accept blame. Don't provide excuses. Tell them the reason and pass that ball to them.

If they inquire, tell them it is something that is usually done off premises to avoid this exact situation but you had an emergency. I'd even request from them how they would like you to handle a similar situation in the future? Do not think for one second that you did anything wrong. Act with confidence and let them speak. Keep your responses short and do not make any excuses. Let them squirm. \n\nIMO, worst thing that happens is this leaks out as to why you weren't fired. If that's the case, at least you have time to get your resume together, if YOU choose to. \n\nFWIW, I'm a 60 yr old male business owner, and would be considered very conservative by Reddit standards. If I were in the meeting, and from what you've written, my attitude would be one (after the initial surprise wore off) to apologize for the situation and do everything in my power to move on as quickly as possible with a positive outcome for all. Frankly, I'd be much more upset about the condition of the restroom.

My coach was upset that we didn\u2019t get done quicker. We have to have one person tossing items and another to push all of the items so that leaves 3 people outside the truck to sort stuff out. Well I have stomach problems and sometimes have to use the restroom often, stomach issues ive had since I was a kid mind you. My coach pulled me into the office today to complain I took too many bathroom breaks and that I wasn\u2019t productive. \nWe are allowed to freely use the restroom  too mind you but now I\u2019m being scolded because I do. Also they don\u2019t take doctors notes either so I couldn\u2019t even hand them a paper from a doctor. \nAlso we have to pull pallets off of the truck first before we can get to the items. They claimed for the first 30 minutes of my shift I stood there just watching everyone else deal with pallets and being unproductive. BITCH I WAS STAYING TF OUTTA THE WAY OF THOSE BIG ASS PALLETS!! Plus I wasn\u2019t being unproductive, again saying out of the way but I also was helping pull stuff out and move the belt. So idk where tf they are claiming I wasn\u2019t productive bro\u2026 Went into the bathroom after my coach had pulled me into the office and just cried. Now mind you my shift coach was the one who complained even tho he wasn\u2019t fucking back there till we already had everything set tf up. ",

I said I would use my 30min lunch, & then whatever time remaining that I need to make up I would after the appointment on top of my regular schedule. Boss said no you can\u2019t do that, you will need to make up the remainder of the day spread out throughout the week. So, instead of making up let\u2019s say 30min that I would be away from my desk, now I have to make up 2 1/2 hrs? How does this make sense & is this legal? This has never ever been a rule until recently\n\nKeep in my mind I do not have reoccurring appointments during work hours, so it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m a habitual \u201cleave work\u201d employee.

It was a 3 shift manufacturing facility and mission critical hourly employees were leaving the premise during their 30min unpaid lunch. We didn't care at first because there were lots of fast food places literally right around the corner so it was feasible to leave, eat, and come back in 30-37min. Unfortunately some people abused it and tried to justify it as we should just pay them for less than 8 hours. Working late to cover lost time didn't make up for the time the machines weren't running since the next shift was scheduled to take over anyway. Thus, we had to be the bad guys and prohibit leaving the premise during unpaid lunch for all hourly operations employees. It was legal, as communicated by HR and our in house attorney. FWIW we did compromise a bit by having a schedule of food trucks and commercial kitchens that took orders ahead of time.",

By the end of your life don\u2019t have any regrets over stupid shit\u2026",

He is trying to get his coworkers\u2019 phone numbers (including mine), making them meet up with him, and coercing them into sending them inappropriate photos of themselves. He is preying on teenagers despite being in his 40s as well as anyone else he deems vulnerable, such as people with disabilities, who make up a significant portion of employees. He has forcibly tried to kiss a married man and asked out a woman despite her repeated refusal. And when people block him, he shows hostility toward them. Multiple people have reported him to management, but he has not been fired yet despite the clear store policy against harassment and the managers just say to simply stay away from him. Since he got my phone number and is trying to meet up with me, I blocked him, but I can not stay away from him because I work in the same department (front end) as he does and am forced to bag groceries at the lane he\u2019s in, and I am also not allowed to leave the front end unless I use the bathroom, but I can\u2019t take long breaks there. \n\nHas anyone here been in a situation like this? If so, what should I do to stay safe from him?  \n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f ",

She started putting out advertisements on her social media accounts and is now being stalked and harassed online by various people.\n\nI'm not talking about men flirting with her or asking her out. I'm talking about men that are making various accounts to find her and talk to her after she has blocked them, men that are pretending to be interested in sales and then threatening her and her coworkers when she inevitably blocks them. Just the other day she had a zoom meeting with someone who showed his cock to her and her manager.\n\nI am honestly at a loss for words and the company she works for really only seems to provide basic tips on how to protect themselves online. She is also in this weird grey area where she isn't an actual employee for the company but a contractor.\n\nHere are some things we have implemented so far:\n\n1. Created business accounts for all of her social media to separate her personal and private life\n2. Anything past a basic inquiry requires a government ID\n3. Using a nickname instead of her personal name\n4. A work cellphone that is separate from her personal cellphone\n5. No sharing of personal information on her business account\n\nAre there other things we can implement that can protect her better online? Better yet, are there things I can implement for her without her knowing to help mitigate these issues? I honestly do not want her to need to think about it if I can help her in some way. I'd like to pass on these tips to her coworkers as well as they seem to have similar issues.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this!",
