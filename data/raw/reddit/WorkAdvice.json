        "text": "Just today I asked my boss if I could work 25-30 hours per week during the upcoming summer season. I figured 25-30 hours a week would give me enough social time (I am a graduating high school senior), and enough time to do some side hustles I usually do each summer. He told me no, and instead said I would be working 40 hours every week, even though I am considered a part time employee. We got into a bit of an argument, to the point of me saying that I would rather just switch jobs to a place that would respect my time and availability, rather than work full time. Of course I got the \u201cyou\u2019re entitled\u201d talk, but I\u2019m not entirely sure if I am or not in this situation. Am I in the wrong?",

                "body": "Presumably since you're a high school student this is an entry level retail or food service type job? And it sounds like this is also not a job you desperately need? Cool, time to practice assertiveness! Don't quit and don't ask permission. Let your boss know, in writing if possible, that your availability is no more than 30 hours per week. If he schedules you for more than that, remind him (again, in writing, texting is fine) that you're only available for X number of shifts and ask which day/s he'd like you to drop. When he says you have to work all of them, let him know that that's unfortunately not possible and ask again if he'd like to decide which shift to reschedule or if he'd rather you pick. Depending on how desperate they are for people and how power trippy he is this will either result in grudging capitulation or an invitation to find a new place of employment, which you were planning to do anyway. Whatever you do, do NOT roll over and work the extra shifts unless you want that to become a pattern in your life.",

So, in this situation, don't tell your boss he's making you think about quitting. Just find the new part-time job and quit. If a boyfriend is yelling at you, get yourself to a safe place and then dump him. If a friend is suddenly undermining you, ghost the crap out of them.\n\nIn any situation where a person is treating you with such disrespect, and calling you names (YOU'RE entitled? I think he was projecting), end the relationship. Telling them \"stop being disrespectful or I'm ending this\" only gives them the chance to argue, call you more names, or worse, plan ways to harm you (professionally, emotionally, reputationally, physically). Get yourself away from the MF er and end it from a distance. \n\nIn your entire life you might be in a situation where you \"owe\" someone an explanation once or twice. This ain't one of those times.",

This client used to be my managers but no longer because they didn't get the help they needed. It seemed like a massive overreaction to me. My colleagues were within ear shot and I felt humiliated.   \n  \nI went to my boss with my concerns of this hostile behavior and mentioned he has issues with her before. In fact one of my colleagues contacted my boss about my manager yelling at me. My boss now wants me to write a short statement about any of the bullying behaviors. He said he wants a record to keep track of any incidents. I'm worried if I do it's going to fall badly on me somehow. My boss is head of department and one of the senior leaders in the company. I kinda just want to move on and keep my head down but not sure what the right thing to do is.  ",

You\u2019ve been invited to make a record of the hostile behaviour which should tell you that you have support and care from those higher than this person. \n\nYou will probably find the manager acts nicer to you (even if it\u2019s fake) if they know their card is marked. If they are stupid and carry on the behaviour then they are just validating the evidence and pretty much signing their own death warrant.\n\nYou have done nothing wrong and nothing to fear.",

But recent changes (not political US) have meant a large number of the workforce has been placed on redundancy. I do the configuration of these two systems. And my manager, architect and Project manager have all been moved off.\n\nI was already a few levels (pay wise like $30K) like under them, and now I'm having to do a large part of their work. While my new manager just hands off every and any new stuff partly because he doesn't know much about it.\n\nBefore it was just configuration but now its the whole thing, the business requirements, the development, the testing the customer discussion. All of it.\n\nMy new manager looks after like 4 teams (full teams) so he's busy and I feel any time I even try to ask what new thing he's giving me or what its about it comes off like I'm being difficult.\n\nTo be honest I'm also just sad because I worked with my manager for 5 years and the architect for 2 and the way they got rid of them like it was nothing. They also do and know so much stuff that now people seem think I'm supposed to somehow pick up all that management shit?\n\nMorale is also very low department wide, every person I talk to is unhappy or feel like they got screwed over bad enough they just bailed. Others treat you with this air of \"do whatever I say\" because they are worried about their roles too and so are trying to appease management.\n\nPart of me wonders whether I should look at getting out, but its about now I'm realising I'm not well placed Resume wise, not many places configure this system on its own. And jobs aren't huge right now either. I'm getting a new manager in a month and I'm not sure if thats a good or bad thing (depends what they are like I guess). But of course the idea that it means they can replace me worries me. Though I guess management was okay getting rid of everyone around me purely because they knew I was staying and I'm the only one that knows how the system is set up currently.\n\nBut actions aside, I just went into work today feeling super depressed today, depressed about the future, depressed about my life. I don't even feel like hussling, i know I should get certs, training, experience, but I just want it to stop for a bit and everyone to stop being shitty when they message me on Teams LOL.",

The job description was not accurate. I though I would be an assistant but Im doing my project managers work. I though maybe ir was normal because all the assistants that work with me are doing the same but as I\u2019ve heard from my friends that are in the same field its not normal. Im constantly stressed and I hate going to work. Recently they let go of one of the assistants and the work load got bigger. I was debating on quitting next month but my project manager is asking when my school year is ending, because she want me to work full time. I dont know what to do. I dont know how and who to tell that I want to quit. I dont know if I should quit because its pretty hard to find a part time position as a student in my field and I kind of need the money. Also I dont really have a good enough reason to quit. Also I feel bad because recently they paid for a work vacation kind of thing. I just need some advice please im so depressed and desperate ",

I work for a retailer, starting off in a retail job and then applied for a job on the e-commerce side of it at their head offices. I did this for job security as me and my partner are saving for a mortgage and it will improve our chances of I\u2019m shown working for the same company for so many years. The company has always had this air of \u201ccasualness\u201d about it, promoting itself as a cool business where cool people work, and encouraging staff to be outwardly friendly. In the head office, it\u2019s kind of the same. It\u2019s got the \u201cGoogle offices\u201d treatment where there\u2019s fairy lights everywhere, posters on the walls, a diverse cast of employees, and we even have a fun atmosphere. I\u2019ve been here now for almost a year, and I still feel extremely othered by my coworkers. They all have their friend groups, which is fine but when it\u2019s such a small team it\u2019s left me on my own in the corner sometimes. I don\u2019t mind this too much, I\u2019ve always been socially awkward and I just keep my head down and do my work. When I chat to them it\u2019s always friendly, and they do talk to me \u2014 except when my boss just decides to not like me. I was sick for a few weeks and when I came back I got the silent treatment from him. And when my coworkers see him deliberately walling me off it\u2019s like they follow suit without needing to be told. It\u2019s now three weeks since I was on sick leave, and my boss is still being passive aggressive towards me. Any time I speak he interrupts me or cuts in to put me down and end the discussion. It\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly getting shut down, and I\u2019ve just started not talking at all when there\u2019s a conversation going because it\u2019s better than getting hurt. The only thing is, this is all really affecting my mental health. I come into work now everyday happy and cheerful, and leave defeated with a low self esteem. I\u2019ve tried so hard to overcome it but it really hurts feeling so belittled every single day. I feel like I can\u2019t talk to anyone about it at work because we don\u2019t really have a HR department in our territory, and even then I would be forwarded to talk to my boss about it. To involve another HR department from the main territory is more hassle than it\u2019s worth because they are utterly useless. \nDoes anyone have any advice on how to deal with something like this? I\u2019m just at such a loss for words. ",

        "text": "Hello, I\u2019m not very fluent with reddit but I need some advice. My boss fired my manager, who is also a good friend, for what seems like very out of the blue to the rest of us. \n\nFor some context, our job is pretty high security and we tend to keep staffing as minimal as possible so it\u2019s already a very competitive work environment, but those who stick around end up being really close as the years go by. My boss has often prided us on our great work culture and everyone getting along. Most of us have worked closely together for at least 2 years now, and are good friends. We\u2019ve celebrated life events together, helped each other outside of work, attended parties together, etc. I\u2019m sure corporate hates seeing employees spending time outside of work with the managers. But there has never been a rule against that, and would be difficult because often times friends/family are hired on to help keep the job low profile. \n\nI really enjoy my job, but the last 6 months or so have been feeling harder and harder. I used to feel that the company really cared of their employees, but lately it feels like we\u2019re just numbers and they care more about profit than us. My manager who was fired always advocated for us. She would listen to our complaints and go straight to management to make our voices heard as well as her own in a very direct and honest way. \n\nA big change that has been challenging for the employees is the changes to the attendance and time off policy. It used to be kind of an unspoken rule that you should not call out more than once in a 30 days period. If you were sick too many days too closely together, that was enough grounds for termination. We are all well aware that attendance is the reason (at least legally) that most people get fired. \n\nThe policy changed after an employee was terminated after not making it to work due car issues. The employee was later hired back after contacting the CEO about their wrongful termination due to a strict policy. The policy was rewritten to be more lenient as long at the employee was communicating with management. \n\nFor some reason, after that the policy changed again stating that because employees only accrue 2 sick days a year, no one should not be missing anymore days than that. My manager was given a warning that she could not miss anymore days for the year since she had already missed 3 days. In a room with a couple other employees, as well as myself, she was complaining to her co-manager her frustration that 2 out of the 3 days she was absent, she had turned in a doctor\u2019s note for. Stating that if she needed to \u201cfight it\u201d she would, but she is monitoring her attendance going forward. Our boss happened to walk in at that moment and overheard the conversation. He immediately pulled her aside to talk to her about being professional in front of employees. She stated, \u201cI don't have to like the policy I just have to follow it\".  \n\nThis did not sit well with our boss because it led to her getting fired a couple weeks later. I have pretty good attendance, but I don\u2019t have children, sick parents, or car issues that would make my attendance suffer like I\u2019ve seen with some of my other colleagues. So the new policies haven\u2019t affected me too much, but it doesn\u2019t seem right to me at all. I\u2019m very upset about my friend losing her job, but my boss seems pretty firm that he will not be changing his mind. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice how I can advocate for my coworkers and myself against what I feel is a very strict policy?",

Sick leave is a benefit if you are sick or family sick leave. It's not the employee's time perse but only if needed. Once we retire, if there is more sick leave accrued than a certain amount, the employee is paid a small percentage. \n\nI think if you have 1000 hours accrued, you get 25% of your wage for 1000- 750 hours. So, if you make $20 per hour, your retirement bonus will be $5 (25%) times 250 hours. It's not a lot but better than a kick in the pants.\n\nNot everyone gets this. Usually, a retiring employee only gets his last paycheck and whatever he has saved for retirement. Plus, there is Social Security. \n\nThere are many times when one is not fit for duty, but a doctor's care is not needed. We need a doctor's note if we are out for more than 3 days. If you have a virus, no one wants you infecting others. A doctor is not needed because there is no cure other than letting your body fight it.\n\nNot everyone here gets this as each business makes its own policy.\n\nI work a safety sensitive job.

So speaking generally....sure.  The boss could fire somebody if they are outspoken about their dislike of new policies at work.  It's shitty, but in most states, it's legal.

        "text": "My son works as a manager at McDonald's.  He recommended someone for hire after an interview and was later told by the GM, assistant store manager, and a regular manager that the man recommended \"wouldn't fit in here\" and it was made very clear that it was because of his skin color. Who do we tell?! My son was very upset and thinks this is ridiculous but we don't know who to tell. As far as I know, it would be on the applicant who would need to bring suit, but there's no way to contact the man to tell him this is why he wasn't hired. ",

What did they say exactly? \n\nWhether this can be escalated successfully depends on what your son actually heard.\n\nAlso - how is there no way to contact the man? He applied for a job. Your son should have his contact info?",

Son then backed away from the conversation because he was dumbfounded.\n\nETA after seeing your edit - he does not have access to applications after the interview is conducted and I'm sure they disposed of it anyway. The interview was a couple weeks before this conversation. It didn't occur to son to take note of any personal information because he was sure the guy would be hired. He remembers the guy's first name, but no last name or address information or a phone number or anything.",

My son was impressed with him and recommended him for hire, as is part of his regular duties as manager - conduct interviews when asked to do so, give recommendations or impressions on whether or not the candidate is right for the job. He had a handful of interviews that day, one no show with a couple \"ok\" candidates but said definitely hire this guy. Then son went on about his duties and gave it no more thought, as usual. At some point it came up again, I'm unsure of the exact details, but when it came up again he was told in no uncertain terms that the man was not hired because he is black. The recommendation for the job was just based on the interview, my son said he seemed like a cool guy who would actually do his job and not cause drama or quit a week later, son does not know the man personally.",

The thing is, even when it\u2019s about race, it\u2019s easy to make the case that it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s not because the candidate is black! Oh my, what an idea! Lord, no, it\u2019s just because their speech is too urban, their hair style doesn\u2019t fit with what the customers at this location like to see! And at that location across town? We didn\u2019t reject that woman because she\u2019d have been the only white or female manager, it was just because she was too soft spoken and sensitive!\n\nTrust me, I\u2019m an area manager for another fast food brand and I can tell you that yes, race is sometimes a factor but these companies provide way too much training on how to cover your ass for you to be able to bring a case. On the other hand, being a poor fit for a location is also a very real thing, and it can be tough to distinguish the two. \n\nI hired a woman my age as a manager for one location. She was very qualified and clearly good at her job but she had constant friction with her GM, other managers and crew at that location - even customers complained about her attitude. I didn\u2019t see any attitude problem in her, but I did notice that her speech and mannerisms were different from mine and from all the white people in her store. All the issues were vague and subtle, impossible to define, open to interpretation. \n\nLegally I could have let her go, told her she was a poor fit - because she WAS. She was a poor fit just like I was when I was 18 and got put in an all black store, and I had a steep learning curve before I fit into that culture. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d hang in there for a year while they all got to know each other, so I offered her a transfer to a different store. The other store was much more diverse, had several black female leaders, and everyone loved her there. They didn\u2019t see disrespect in the way she moved her head when she talked, the customers weren\u2019t bothered by her hair and nails, and the crew listened to her. \n\nThe real world isn\u2019t that simple. Race matters, indirectly, because it is tied to culture. Culture matters, so in a way, race matters. Of course it also matters in ways it shouldn\u2019t, discrimination is real too, but it\u2019s very fucking hard to tell, let alone prove, when it\u2019s racism and when it\u2019s cultural differences. \n\nYour son will have a very tough time in life if he is ready to do all out battle over suspected discrimination that didn\u2019t directly affect him. Instead of trying to fight the system, he can change it from within by rising up and making smarter staffing decisions.",

The 2nd of may I was put on a job all week but with the wrong pay so I mentioned this and got told well that\u2019s what it is.. but it states different in my contract. So come the Saturday I felt stressed and my mental health took over. I let my managers aware on the Saturday and put a few days annual leave in and on the day I was ment to be in work I rang in but no one answered.. I have to ring if I am not well etc and followed company policy. The managers went ahead and cancelled the holidays I put in to cover pay as I was told I need to give them a weeks notice? Also never rang me back or responded to a text I sent as no one answered. In the text I also stated the day I would be back in work and also told them a 2nd time a few days before the new week. They have not contacted me about anything and they have now left me with no work for all week this week even through I told them I\u2019ll be back.. I am contracted to 40+ hours a week and employed. Why are they doing this and this really isn\u2019t helping my mental health. :( I have been here for 3 years+ and based in the UK England",
