        "text": "So bit of backstory, 33 m autistic and met a girl on hinge who's 30 ish and also autistic. We chatted for a month on messeger and went on our first date today, it was really nice day, nothing sexual happened at all. But while we were walking by the river I asked to hold her hand and we did, immediate boner. Was abit embarrassing as my member is a grower and was probably noticeable, she didn't say anything though.\nI wasn't thinking about sex at the time so just interested in why on earth it happened. Please don't make fun, I'm on the spectrum and not been on hardly any dates. I do like her but unsure if I like like her, this hand holding boner may be a sign I do?",

I could probably bring that down to 90% if I worked on my game, but that's as low as I could take it. Rejection is inevitable, I get that. It's just hard not to let it demoralize you after awhile.\n\nI'm not saying that it's impossible for men to be successful approaching in-person, but I am saying that it's probably just as difficult as dating apps in it's own ways. It's definitely not cheat code people say it is.\n\nI'm gonna keep trying of course, but I think no matter how you slice it dating is just a lot more difficult for men than it was in the past, and it's hard not to feel stuck.",

My grandparents met at random in a grocery store.  My father and mother met in high school.  \n\nHowever finding a genuine woman these days is extremely hard because it feels everyone is looking for something unreasonable and unrealistic. \n\nGuy has to make for than 6 figures, has to drive expensive car, has to be atleast 6 feet tall. \n\nAll decent guys want is someone to share their time with which leaves very little for the remaining 10%",

My fianc\u00e9 ticks one of the three requirements you seem to think women have, and that's only because he happens to be over 6ft. I out earned him for the majority of our relationship. Neither of us drive. We adore each other, support each other, and never aren't having fun together, even when we're just chilling on the couch. That's all I've ever wanted, not some asshole with a fast car. I'd go so far as to say I'd maybe only dated one other conventionally attractive guy, other than my fianc\u00e9. The rest look like they snuck onto earth, but for whatever reason we clicked at the time. Very little going for a single one of them. Doesn't matter when you're thinking with your heart. I love my fianc\u00e9 to death, to me he is the most handsome man on this planet - but I also know he's likely not jaw-dropping to most people, and who cares - neither am I! I'm the one that has to look at him and I think he's perfect. \n\n\nIt's honestly quite sad that you don't seem to be able to see women as individuals with different wants and needs, and I imagine that's got a lot to do with your lack of success. We don't like feeling like projects to be picked apart, \"women like this, women don't like that, women want this\".... have you ASKED a WOMAN what she wants? Because I'm telling you, you've got it waaaay backwards. \n\n\nY'all also seem to ignore the worst thing that is likely to happen to a man is rejection. We'd be lucky if that were the biggest risk posed to us in dating! All I'll say is a lot of y'all have created an environment where it's simply not safe for women to meet new people, who haven't been vetted by someone they know. That's why we keep telling y'all to focus on your friendships! If you can be a good friend you can be a better boyfriend. I only met my fianc\u00e9 because my best friend essentially strong armed me into talking to him, and I'm glad they did, because I'd completely sworn off dating men due to the physical danger they'd put me in previously. I could trust that my friend wouldn't put me with someone who'd do that to me again, and it's been working out great. \n\n\nIf you \"don't care to find\" a social circle, you'll be lonely. Lol sorry, like one plus one is two, you will be lonely if you don't have friends. You will put too much pressure on your girlfriend, if you do find one, to tend to all your social and emotional needs. It pushes them away and creates a relationship where they don't feel their own needs are equally met. We've beeeeeen saying this, so it's up to you if you listen or not.",

So it's not a requirement \"think\" but is rather objectively true. \n\nI also stated I have 2-3 friends.  Who I see a handful of times out of the year due to them having their own families now.  So assuming I'm doing nothing with my time but sitting at home is just wrong.  I have my hobbies and vices and dont need someone to take on a social burden for me to feel social or someone to keep my company every waking moment lol. \n\nI feel you kind of are proving my point in how shallow the majority of woman are these days when it comes to relationships.  \n\nIt's okay if you feel differently, most woman cant think subjectively when they feel strongly towards a specific topic. \n\nAlso just want to wrap back around to when you said \"most of yall have created an unsafe environment for woman\". That's not us sweet heart. That's you!

Meanwhile you are also saying you'd feel bad for any woman in my presence knowing that will never be an issue? Get real you are absolutely projecting and being misogynistic by definition. \n\nI was raised with two older sister and a single mother, I care for all of them deeply and they showed me so much about respecting everyone equally and to not feel men or woman are better than one another. \n\nI was humbled by my family more times than I can count growing up and I'm a better person for it.  However people like you who lump a minority of shitty people in with the rest and pinning it on a gender isnt misogynistic. \n\nI was stating what most woman in my experience are looking for not what they want nor was I assuming what they want.  I have been told numerous times that I'm not tall enough or I dont fit \"X\" check box so yes woman absolutely look for superficial qualities rather than looking inward to a personality and beyond the surface.\n\n  Your exact words were \"I'm with my fiance because he ticks one of three boxes I listed\" thus proving my point on you being shallow in this moment.\n\nNext point Because I dont care to find some large superficial social circle i dont have a social life?  I have friends from work I will hang with on 4th of July and the occasional beer after a long work week.  I see atleast one of my 3 close friends atleast once a because again they have lives too.  I make it a point to go do something with a buddy atleast once a month to catch up and go out.  But because I dont have some superficial huge social circle I hang out with every week I'm not social.  Right sure thing.  \n\nYou are the exact thing I was describing and it's funny you have proved my point in more ways than one.  \n\nPlease show this to your husband and see what he thinks about this whole discussion.  Guarentee he wont agree with you.  \n\nFeel free to check AITO sub because this is surely being posted very shortly.  I will do you favour and courtesy of censoring your name so you dont get a bombardment of hate.  \n\nHave a good night.",

Once the baby is born. Not in the time period before. \n\n\nThe time period before is irrelevant. The father is not the one who's pregnant. It is not a reproductive issue. If men are worried about getting women pregnant, they should be more proactive in using birth control or getting vasectomies. Like we are. \n\nI suppose it's not technically illegal in the UK to abandon your children as a father, but you'd really think it is considering how many people I know whose fathers walked out on them without a trace. In practice the dads still aren't around, still aren't paying money. In practice there's currently a brain dead woman hosting a fetus in her body because the hospital aren't allowed to turn off life support.",

An effective male birth control pill was successfully trialled, but was not distributed publicly because of the fear of a spike in depression in men.

You're rate in person is likely to be much higher actually.\n\nHowever....the thing is....I've always been old school as shit for a while....as in, if I see a girl looking good while out or whatever and it doesn't seem like she's obviously with someone or doesn't wanna be engaged with....I don't give any fucks to go talk to her. \n\nIn fact if I get into a solid banter with a girl....oh my God that's the best. \n\nHowever....that's hard as shit nowadays and I've been meeting people out and about since 2010 or so. \n\nIts seemed like a switch got kicked in 2022 though. I've met several people while out and about but literally in the last few years ALL the numbers I've gotten while out and about have not turned into anything.....and ive literally wrecked my brain for a LONG time trying to configure why and Ive never found an answer yet. It's really frustrating tbh. Nonetheless I've heard multiple other people say the same thing that they had similar vibes while out and what not ....and then right around that same time something just completely changed. \n\nNonetheless I still love talking to women while out and absolutely fucking love catching a vibe at random. \n\nI think the energy of being out and about and just meeting someone makes it feel so much more fucking kinetic and supercharged but it's so effing hard to find.",

And it's not attractive at all. \n\nMostly because I don't attend to be hit on, and because its hard to shut down under the circumstances, but also because it's a desperate act where they will literally move from one woman to the next, in front of all of us, never speaking to the men, and regardless of whether we all look completely different or not. \n\nMost people have a type or preferences at least that means they are selective in who they approach. A man who approaches every single woman is an opportunist who only wants a human female body. But we aren't objects, we aren't sex toys. We aren't there to entertain some bloke or stop him being lonely and celibate. \n\nIt turns what should be a fun activity or social event into an exhausting series of manoeuvres where we have to avoid him and band together to protect ourselves and each other. \n\nAnd these men know they are hitting on us, and we know it too, but he hasn't *technically* done or said anything to make it obvious, so it's hard to then say thanks but no thanks. After all it's a social event, why not be social with him? People are there to make friends, why not be friends with him? But he isn't there to be social or friendly and we know it. \n\nThis behaviour overlooks the need for consent and shows complete contempt for the women being targeted because these men don't back off. Which adds to the irritation and anger of the situation. I don't get a choice and I have to be the one to say something to get him to leave me alone making it seem like I'm the aggressor in the situation. And for many women, doing this is very difficult. \n\nThat's why people say not to attend clubs, or any other activity, just to hit on women. We aren't potential future girlfriends for some random bloke. We are people and deserve to be treated with respect whether you're attracted to us or not, whether you're lonely or not, whether you want a girlfriend or not.

        "post-author": "renandstimpydoc",
        "text": "Ive been happily married for 16 years so this may seem like an odd post here. Looking back at some truly hair raising dating encounters, I thought I might be able to pass along some rearview mirror dating advice now that I've come out the other side. (Hold on, it's worth the quick read, I promise.)\n\nThe secret to dating is numbers.Not body counts--unless that's all you care about (no judgement)--but meeting the maximum number of people you can afford, have time for and are willing to meet. *Ok, nothing shattering so far, but there's a big caveat:*\n\nMAKE A LIST of what you will and will not accept from a partner, in order of importance, and do NOT deviate from the top 3-4 items on each side. If you are turned off by tall, short, thin, bigger, etc. people do NOT make excuses. Do NOT engage. Move on immediately. \n\nBy just makiing this list you'll start to see patterns in your own choices--good or bad. I dated for ten years before I realized the people I dated were variations of the same person. They often had the same or similar family backgrounds, handled conflict in similar ways and tbh, repeated some of the chaos in my own background. Worse, I often stuck around too long because I didn't have the ability to cut them off when I should have. \n\nCircling back to the earlier point about numbers, always remember there is an opportunity cost for *everything.* That second or third date with someone who \"isnt a fit based on your list but they're hot, rich, might change, etc.\" is time off the market. Even if that time is spent working on yourself, meeting new friends or making yourself available for a chance encounter. \n\nYes, numbers can feel like work. And in some ways it is--just like a successful relationship. However, if are armed with your list, and keep in mind it's quantity that will find your quality, some of the preseure comes off. It's just a date with a friend. \n\nGood luck out there. \u2764\ufe0f",

It's why I say so many ppl feel \"tired\" from dating. They're spending all this time on people who they know aren't going to work out instead of going to find someone who will. Stop trying to get that girl out that shot you down twice and is like pulling teeth to get out. Stop seeing that dude who told you he's \"going with the flow' when you know you want something serious.",

But really all we were looking for is compatibility and this mindset of \"they can change\" is a stupid one. Nobody will ever change to fit you. It's easier to just keep looking even if you're single for a while. Being single is being available. \n\nI regret every past relationship I went into because I thought I wasn't good enough to ask for better. All it meant was I had to wait longer to find my boyfriend and be happy. I think so often about if I was single if we could have met sooner, but he always says that we met at the right time and that my choices made me who I am so he could love me even more. He's so sweet, I'm sure you understand why I wish I'd never met another man before him lmao. It makes me feel worse about myself knowing I had stooped so low just because I was lonely and insecure.

Easy to learn in .5 seconds. Not gonna date conservative, or complicated immigration status (horror story of a friend), or lacking a good support network. Really easy to chat and at least guess all those things very early. No need to even be flirty or approach with intentions to date. And if you make friends that way great!

I care because there are many things that I have been 'spoken to' about as far as my tidiness. \n\n\\-toilet seat, garbage taken out, socks on the floor, kitchen swept, dirty dishes put away, wet towel in bathroom, beer can in living room, clean sheets, laundry washed but not sorted and I could go for a long time. \n\nIf I know she is coming I have those things all presentable.  I also know that many women also have their little soppy habits, and they do care because they want to show a presentable place.   I mean, how can you call your BF a slob when you do the same things on your own?",

I know it's an important thing for guys but since we're not official yet I think I can deny it cause for me it's not that important and I also want them to care about me as a person. I don't know if maybe I shouldn't accept it from the start so it's not so weird to them after but  they always talk me into it and I feel dump after \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Then they always guilt me if I don't want it for example one said that it's rude that I'm in his house and I don't want to be touched so much or ask me if I really like him like that. The guy I'm dating now says that sex is normal and I'm weird for asking him to be romantic so I can feel more appreciated cause he doesn't know me that well yet (even though we're going out for almost 3 months) and believes he's already being generous by paying for my coffee/drink when we go out or driving me to his country house for a day. I appreciate it sure but I feel like it's an exchange cause my feelings aren't valid if I say no. He feels like I see him as a friend to go out. Idk maybe I'm just stupid in these situations and don't know how to handle them. I believe that if I do what they want, be pleasant, kind, pretty, interesting etc, then they'll see me as a gf but that never happens and I'm getting tired. Do I come off as desperate?",

Im Offering insight into how some of us operate. \n\nAngry is over the top but I bet every guy ever has been annoyed when being denied. Just like you might be annoyed when your house isn't clean or someone cuts you off. It's not a negative it's a reflection on how much we desire and want you.

The reason I feel this way is because no one denying sex should warrant a \"2 hour fight\", regardless of gender. If you're upset that someone doesn't want to have sex, then that is a you problem and not something that should be put on a partner. While you're entitled to feel however you're feeling, making your partner feel bad or guilty for not wanting to have sex can lead to coercion, which is not consent. Do you want a partner who is enthusiastic to have sex with you or just doing it because you've been pouting for an hour?",

Showing you're frustrated is ok. People want what they want talking about and negotiating seems logical. And no men don't want favors we want enthusiasm. When me and my buddies go bitch about women while we golf this is the stuff we talk about. Thought id share some insight. Every guy friend I have is extremely driving and motivated by sex, smart women can get everything they want real quick by realizing that. I offered a time solution to show how easy it really should be. Again, you want to fight over it for five hours a week or fuck, have fun, and get you emotional needs met?

You feel sex is transactional and that your partner should give you access to their body whenever YOU want, regardless of how they feel, if they want you to be a real partner in the relationship. You say you want a woman to be enthusiastic, but you're literally suggesting that women should just have sex with men when they don't want to because it means they'll get something out of it later. That is not enthusiasm and if you think it is, that's just really sad. No one is getting their emotional needs met by being pressured into having sex. \n\nYou don't want a partner. You want a sex doll.",

Good men who respect you and care about you won't be upset at all if you don't want sex because they get value from you as a person. If you say no to sex and they push they are shitty people to begin with. Find a man who doesn't push and you will also be more likely to find one who won't get upset if you aren't feeling into having sex every time you see them. \n\nI've met both kinds of men and I can assure you the ones who haven't pushed for sex are the same ones who will end up actually caring about you as a person. \n\nAnd what someone buys for you or does for you(like coffee or taking you somewhere nice) doesn't guarantee them sex. Unless you are a sex worker you should not put monetary value on what  things earn someone sex with you. There is nothing that anyone can do or give to me that means they are for sure going to get sex from me. NOTHING. And that is something my husband both agrees with and has felt is the right way for things to be from the very beginning of when I met him. He has zero expectations that my body belongs to hin because it DOESN'T. It belongs to ME and I CHOOSE to give it to him.\n\nNo one and nothing makes someone deserve your body or sex from you. Period. It is a choice you make willingly and consensually. And anything else is gross and bordering on rapey. Saying you owe someone sex because they bought you coffee and took you to their country house is GROSS and if that's the kind of transactional relationship they want they can hire a sex worker! \n\nAre you a sex worker? If not then tell them no matter what they spend or do for you it is not a guarantee they will get sex. Because it's not a transactional thing. It is a consensual choice and emotional and mental thing. Anyone who expects otherwise isn't seeing you as a person they are seeing you as a hole to stick it in!",

I think the time frame just transforms these disconnected attempts at interactions to 'obsessed' 'desperate' at worst or 'low effort' 'overeager' 'lacking confidence' at best, with these contact attempts being so long after making your first impression -- and I'm applying this to the case of in-person peripheral encounters.\n\n\nlike if you see the girl face-to-face 3 or 4 times but you only message her after the 4th time u saw her, that frequency of communication is weird if you already have her contact info -- like why did you not msg her already, or why do you not talk to her in person but then msg her afterwards, but also you dont even msg her every time you see her, so she doesnt know when to expect a msg from you,  and then when you do msg it's just dating interest....\n\n\n it works different online -- like matching w someone again, or deciding to message someone u added online & just msg them randomly  or msg them all the way later next year on their birthday thats different\n\n(((or maybe you actually do want to message her on her birthday or special occasion, but imo that would get more into a serendipitous timing than msging out of the blue...)))\n\nim a dude. may or may not work in a similar occupational setting and might have gone through this or similar to this... but more than once...\n\nthings went somewhere (sort of) only one time. and when it went somehwere it was obvious. the half ass replies were obvious if i just looked at it objectively. when a girl is thoughtful with her replies there is some character there. when she is just filling in the blanks during texting: its a signal -- of course sometimes possibly a signal  of stress/anxiety/depression, but reasons aside, the outcome is there: there is no interest. ((or maybe you make interest out of bonding over the stress/anxiety/depression. a relationship can progress in any one or other unexpected way ))\n\nindeed its just a shoot your shot thing. i still work with some of the girls regularly. they do not care. i have more investment/memory of any of it than any of them.",

Every man should have at least one trusted female friend or close healthy relationship with his sister/female cousin.\n\nI noticed that man who are not in contact with women often are just sort of confused - do not know how to have a conversation with woman, get nervous, make strange asumptions. It just always more pleasant to talk to a man who knows how to talk to woman and knows things about woman.\n\nEven in dating those man just seem more desirable. Their female friends will help them navigate dating, they will make sure he does not have misoginistic views and it also shows that he is capable of having platonic relationships with woman - in other words, he sees woman as people worth of having a friendship with, respecting their opinion and not objectifying them.\n\nWhat do you think about man with female frirends? Good, bad?",

You make it seem like hotness comes from the body, when women are all different, some women just find good grooming hot. Shower, dress well, get a good hair cut, facial hair that suits you. Listen to what women truly find attractive, not what men think women find attractive.\n\nMy buddy first hit the gym to get women, thinking that was his ticket. Thankfully his sister helped him realize that his tight tshirts and bulging muscles made women think he was full of himself, even though it was kind of the opposite. Now he just fines a nice mid-space of being fit for his personal confidence, dressing very nice (but not obnoxious), and being extremely upfront with what he's looking for in a relationship.\n\nHe went from having zero dates to now he's basically poly.",

People aren't a monolith and therefore tastes are obviously incredibly varied, but you're honestly spot on with how a lot of women feel about gym bros. It's cool if you want to get ripped or whatever, but there's a culture and a mindset that comes with it that is DEEPLY unappealing to a lot of people. I have friends that are women who specifically avoid guys that approach them in the gym because there's a culture of misogyny, shallowness, aggression, steroids, just doing it to specifically pick up women etc that is incredibly unattractive. It's obviously not going to be the case for everyone of course though, it's just something I've observed. \n\nI fully accept that I have a biased view about this because I honestly don't generally find ripped dudes hot (even when I was younger, super thin and more conventionally attractive because I didn't wear glasses etc). The person I found the most attractive in my single days was 5'7-5'8, had glasses, was stocky and chubby, had salt and pepper hair in his mid 20's, and was socially awkward af. But he absolutely drove me crazy physically. I don't really have a specific type with guys, but either a husky build like Matt Berry or David Harbour, or scrawny like Peter Capaldi or Joseph Gilgun is my JAM!! Muscles/shmuscles. When manosphere types state what women apparently all like, I throw up a little bit in my mouth because it's just so far removed from my truth (and tbh, MOST women) that it's laughable.",

An app isn't anywhere close to the experience of meeting someone at a party or something. On an app you're basing your attraction to someone on a few images and a short bio, it's not the same as chatting in person and being able to see a person's mannerisms, their smell, the cadence to their voice, finding more about things they're into, any mutual interests etc. An interaction on dating apps is inherently less personal and people (especially women because of the volume of matches and messages they get compared to guys) will generally be more discerning and picky. \n\nHonestly, a date every week (assuming you're talking about a DIFFERENT date every week?) sounds exhausting and unrealistic. I also don't understand your logic behind \"having to reject/get rejected by someone\"? What if you both really hit it off and like each other but it's your first date, are you then supposed to decline any further dates just because you want to shop around more? That's fucking absurd. If you go into a first date with the immediate self imposed pressure of \"could this person be my girlfriend\" you're setting yourself and them up for failure. Something more along the lines of \"do I vibe well with this person?\" and just going in with the intention to get to know them better and go from there based on mutual attraction and compatibility is a much more productive mindset. \n\nI know that dating apps are the norm for a lot of people, but that shit is just depressing and unproductive for a healthy mentality towards dating for the vast majority of people. I have a partner now, but if I were on dating apps now as a chubby 40 yo ginger with glasses it'd be a very different story than to when I was in my 20's, thin and pre-glasses, lol.\n\nThe main places I've met people when I used to date around was mutual friend's house parties, dinner parties, a trivia night, gigs, an art exhibit, low-key drinks after work. I personally think places/events where you have mutual friends and acquaintances is ideal because you have some common ground and there's an element of reassurance there, because even though the other person is a stranger to you, they're not to your friends. Second best imo is a place like the aforementioned art exhibit or gig because then you have something to talk about and it can generally be assumed that they're into this same thing that you are (whether it's a band, a D&D night, bocce ball, whatever). \n\nI've for SURE had long bouts of not hooking up with anyone, and I've definitely caught myself putting people off on dates from being awkward or coming across as a bit intense or manic or something because I wasn't in a good headspace. Desperation is also very evident, even if you think you're hiding it well (again, speaking personally). If you're having a shit time mentally that absolutely comes across on a date and/or when approaching someone. \n\nAll this to say that there's no \"key\" to dating. Everyone's different in terms of what they like, are comfortable with, dating styles etc so there's no use looking for one single thing that will magically make you appealing to women. My advice is to work on your mental health and mindset. Be cognisant of what media and influences you're partaking in, and whether or not there's negative and unhelpful views being expressed (particularly against women). Stop putting pressure on yourself and others. Go to events etc with friends if possible and chat to people (women AND men) when it feels natural so you feel more comfortable around others in general.",

As simple as I can make it. He already has the physique don't get rid of it just because personality is more important. Looks help you get in the door. That's the point of the story. Stop focusing on the shoes or the muscles. Does it make sense now? The point isn't about the particular,  thats just the flavour. is about having both the looks and the personalities. If he's buff, guess what you may not care for a lot of girls, like fit guys even if they don't say it. If they were two guys one fit one not but both have great personalities she's probably going for the fit guy because he looks more physically attractive. Obviously there's a limit to looks but yes there you go. \n\nAnd I say woman like lighter men because I have been consistently pushed the side for lighter men. Because I'm black I have this lived experience. I'm not pulling the s*** out of my butt",

Telling you what you like or don't like? This is a crazy thread and i sympathise with you.\n\nI think the reality is a mix of things. Men should be listening to what women want, but also think critically about how to go about it. So many men here are just saying \"if the advice doesn't truly work then women are dumb and useless\"\n\nPeople think im crazy when i say i learned to be suave from James Bond, because he's famously misogynistic. But i leave the misogyny at the door and just take the appealing elements. He's well groomed, moderately fit (the original bond fit, healthy not muscular), know what good food tastes like, can pick a good wine or cocktail, know where to take a woman so they're entertained properly. With just a bit of critical thinking, men can hear what women are saying and also take cues from successful sources and come up with a plan.",

The actions those women are taking in dating are proven to work and are actually practical for real women who face the dating environment that women actually face. The advice men would give is for a imaginary woman from someone who's never experienced dating as a woman.\n\nIn general people are not very aware of their own desires and the situation they inhabit. Assuming men give good advice on getting men only makes sense if you think people are perfectly self aware. A guy will filter the advice through his dating experience but the woman he's giving advice to isn't in the same position as the women he's trying to date. A guy will likely give advice based on how he wants the women he is into but who aren't into him to behave but the woman probably doesn't want to appeal to guys she doesn't like. She wants advice of how to appeal to the men she likes but who doesn't fully reciprocate.\n\nIt's not that women (or men) specifically don't know what they want but rather their advice even if good probably isn't targeted at the real problem that the other person is actually facing. Telling a guy to listen well and put in effort on dates isn't bad advice but if you can't get a single date then it's not really helpful either. Don't write off dating advice from the other gender, it's an important perspective but recognise it's limited by coming from a very different place.",

Women often give bad advice to guys, because you give advice based on what you want a guy you have some degree of interest in to do for you.\n\nGoing back to your comment, if a guy follows your advice, a common result will be an angry/flustered/ etc woman over the thought that a guy was trying to be there friend simply to get in their pants.

I know this from over a decade of experience dating women from all sorts of walks of life and in different areas, and im now married.  Wife just agreed with me too!\n\n>I'd advise getting more relevant life experience before trying to give people advice\n\nHow many women have you dated?",

The latter is  is bad because that's really the act of being a friend and so changing that up can be viewed as underhanded. But you can absolutely be friendly to someone you're just getting to know - or know casually - in a way that shows clear respect and genuine interest on a personal level, but also gives an impression that you are open to pursuing something more romantic (or at least aren't dismissing the idea).\n\n>How many women have you dated?\n\nTotal? Lost count, but definitely between 20 and 100. At the moment three, but that's due to really bad timing. Known them all for different amounts of time and they've all suddenly decided they're interested in me.\n\nWhich is crazy because according to your worldly experience dating, two of those situations should be completely impossible and never happening. That I was on a one way ticket to the friend zone with them. But I'll defer my 25 years experience to [the kissless virgin at 24](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kzc0o0/comment/mv4qfuz/?context=3).\n\nRegardless, I'm not here for a dickwaving contest. I'm here to tell you the you're a  hostile little worm and need to get out of advice subs if you're going to shovel your toxicity and presumed authority onto people as means of engagement like you're doing to the OP and I, especially when you think a relatively ordinary dating trajectory is some noteworthy feat.\n\nWhy can't you have a civil conversation with them without resorting to beating them over the head and perpetually telling them that you dated for a decade and got married? Go back to your wife and focus on your relationship instead if that's how you act giving advice. Better still, ask her to proofread your shit so you don't sound like such a giant douche",

Maybe you can go through my comment history again and find it? Let me know.\n\nIts simply highly unlikely, especially if you are the kind of person who is seeking dating advice on reddit - sitting around and being friendly is not going to work. If you are already experienced and attractive, of course you have better odds and will be able to toe the line.\n\n>Why can't you have a civil conversation with them without resorting to beating them over the head and perpetually telling them that you dated for a decade and got married?\n\nSorry, not sure im following here again.

Got me there!\n\n>And it wouldn\u2019t matter if I dated women, because those women would be lesbian,\n\nIt would definitely matter. Why would them being a lesbian mean anything? The whole point is that you have no idea what actions illicit positive and negative outcomes in a 1 on 1 dating context with another woman, because youve never done it.  All you know is whats in your own head and what your friends and sisters report back, which is all twisted up to protect the ego(s) at play.\n\n>This is just a silly attempt to invalidate me, because you\u2019re desperate to think you\u2019re right and absolutely foaming at the mouth to think well of yourself.\n\nYou may be overthinking it a bit and making yourself angry. Ive just been asking you over and over again if youve ever dated a woman before, because the advice you initially offered in the thread - that \"Loyalty\" should be prioritized above all else when seeking to attract and date a woman -  was hogwash and would never work outside of a RomCom. You kept dodging the question and typing paragraphs dancing around the answer until you finally admitted it 7 responses later.\n\nI wouldnt have the faintest clue how to date a man - so you dont see me in here offering advice to woman (or gay men!) about what men want and need  in a dating context.",

But have you ever thought about the fact that if your humor rubs women the wrong way is because most women dont like it for legitimate reasons, and try to understand what are those reasons, hence this is one of the many examples of why it is important to have female friends in your life, to understand women more and to know what to avoid doing with women you will be potentially attracted to? \n\nAs for the interest, sometimes its great to have friends with different interests, we learn from our differences , we show people new things and share our interests with them, and this is how we evolve as a society!",

Because most crushes will die off fairly quickly.\n\nMy point is: once you get over this stage with a platonic female friend (as a male, or vice versa), male-female friendships are absolutely possible. There's no need to shut anyone down \"just\" because you've developed a crush on them.

(Being a close/best friend), If a guy has trouble speaking to a woman, it probably just means he's attracted to them. (Which doesn't exactly negate that he doesn't care about or has affection for who he desires.)\n\nWhat you tend to actually mean is when a guy is sexually attracted to you first without actually forming a bond or having affection for you. (And this is where many people start to have a disconnect of opinons and experience from, because its an entire different outlook of perspective of what Romance is and what it should look like.)\n\nIts of weither having Sex (sexual attraction) separate from Romance or not. \n\nAnd as what most guys believe or were probably taught already, is that Sex IS seperate from Romance, while most women (from what ive seen and experienced) would say or act in a way that it isn't. (Which is where the concept of the Friendzone originates from, where when a guy and a woman are friends, but she doesn't see him as a romantic or sexual outlit, she doesn't have feelings for the guy (which more so equates to attraction than affection))\n\nAnd where \"Situationships\" start to take place within the dating world. (Where people are attracted to one another sexually, but can't seem to be in a fully committed relationship with one another)\n\nI could go more so into detail, but I wouldn't want the comment too long, but overrall if a guy sees a womanas a Romantic aspect, there really shouldn't be a problem with weither they can be friends with any woman, given that they'd have to be a friend in the first place if they're intentions were to pursue something Romantic.",

(Meaning if a guy doesn't need to be friends first to be in a relationship, why be friends at all, if he himself, doesn't believe in having to be friends or if sex was all he wanted.)\n\nWhich ofc leads to situationships.\n\nThis is kind of why I would think Sex should be seperate from Romance even though you can and its not a bad thing to have it in relationships, but more so because i don't that you should be getting with people too early that you don't know or have a good amount of experience with before pursuing something Romantic with them. \n\nSure this leads to the Friendzone in most cases and perhaps not as a great motivator or even a way for a relationship to happen, but it is the safest option and what actually tends to make people form bonds with others, that would make a Romantic relationship more fulfilling given you already have a foundation, rather than building it as you go of already being in a relationship with someone. (Which tends to usually end badly, because there isn't one)",

I will be honest; Have I considered the fact that they could be into me in the beginning of our friendships? Yes. But I would never be comfortable with getting into a relationship with them. I just see them as people with a different perspective on life and everything seems to work out. I am the sort of person that naturally takes a helpers approach (dissociating yourself and focusing on helping the other person like a psychologist or something) when people reach out to me about their problems and the female friends I mentioned do the same thing and I see that as a form of building trust in your friendship. \n   \nHowever having female friends in no way contributes to (based on my very limited experience) how good my dating life is. Because to be able to have completely platonic female friends in this fashion requires the ability to see everyone as just another human, no matter their gender. So when you get a girlfriend your female friends' advice is just as worthless as your male friends' advice. The only thing they maybe could help me about would be the physiological challenges or effects of being female but that varies vastly between females as well so even on that front the best person that could give you advice about your relationship is your partner. The caveat to this is that because you don't differentiate people based on their gender, It's extremely hard to feel attracted to someone based on your sexual and romantic orientation. That sort of leads to (or is caused by I am not sure on that front) you being very closed up about your emotions which makes it hard to date people. I choose to take that risk(?) when I don't differentiate people based on gender.\n   \nTherefore I wouldn't say having female friends or not is a big signifier. The main thing you should look out for is how they treat people based on their gender. If they act differently when interacting with a certain gender than that could be a potential red flag but to what extent they're acting different matters a lot. \n   \nFor instance I feel way more comfortable making dad jokes and such about sex and relationships around male friends as I know I won't be judged by them. When I'm talking to a female friend however, I feel like I have to constantly make sure that things don't get weird or that they dont assume I'm into them or something. The potential of being misunderstood is a great burden and it sometimes makes it inconvenient to form friendships with females.\n    \nThis is only my point of view on the matter as it could go differently for everyone so take it with a grain of salt.\n   \nIn conclusion, the only thing I could definitely say is that it's only a red flag when the guy acts blatantly and consistently different when interacting with females.\n  \nPS: I'm not a native speaker so some of my lexical choices could be wrong, you can ask me to elaborate on or clarify stuff if need be.\n   \nI'd also like to clarify that I'm not sure if I should use gender or sex in this case so you can replace \"gender\" with whatever word means \"being male or female\" for you.\n   \nI'm open to be constructively critisized on both counts.",

All of this makes them more pleasant to date. I am not saying that man without female friends are lost cause, but there is higher chance of them seeing woman as something \"strange\", \"unknown\" - that just makes it uncomfortable to talk to them",

I've met zero women in my life who are interested in the same stuff as me. Sure, I could try other hobbies to meet people, but that's not what I really enjoy.\n\nIn my view, to have a genuine friendship, you need to not be attracted to the person *and* share a lot of common interests. In my 31 years, I've met zero women interested in going to death metal concerts, talking about determinism, playing Street Fighter competitively, or discussing Dark Souls lore. Sure, I could go to a pop concert or do yoga to meet people, but that's not who I am. \n\nI still view women as human beings and recognize they face specific struggles... That doesn't change just because I haven't found a woman who likes listening to Dying Fetus\n\n\nI don't think that you necessarily need to first be friends with a women in orden to have a relationship with her. I have seen some degree of success with women lately and I have been extremely direct and honest with them, letting them know that I don't want to be their friend... \n\nBut to be fair in my longest relationship (10 years) I eventually developed a something like  best friend dinamic with my SO along the relationship.",

Otherwise why would it matter if awkward people exist. Lol if someone is awkward I just assume that there friendship is harder to obtain and if I don't t feel like putting in the effort i won't butt if I feel as if I like  the person I would try to reach out to them in a emotional level maybe ask more questions about there passion or maybe music they like to listen. I would never try to start small talk with them because I can tell they aren't good at it. Honestly I hardly ever view anyone as awkward just different and usually the people I think are different turn out to be WAYYYY better communicators they just dont know how to small talk",

I wouldn\u2019t lie if they asked but I\u2019m also not saying anything about it. I think I\u2019m anxious about feeling bad not giving myself to one at a time like I used to and them feeling like a second choice which isn\u2019t my intention I just don\u2019t want to commit to one person if it\u2019s the first date.

She did not ask if you were having sex with someone else. And if you were out with a friend who you weren't trying to date, you wouldn't bring up the sex either right?\n\nDo not say you were on a date with someone else. There is no benefit to either of you. \n\nHowever, and this is important: do not lie. If she asks if you were on a date, or sleeping with someone, be honest. That doesn't mean tell her every detail. She might very well be cool with it but isn't interested in the specifics. \n\nIt's a \"Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to\" thing. Just like you probably don't need to know all the details of her stuff. \n\nNow. Sleeping with / dating multiple people requires you to be vigilant about your safety in regards to sexual health. \n\nGet tested between every new partner. Yes, every one.\n\nHere is where you need to be fully transparent and forward without prompting. If someone tells you that you need to get tested, inform your other partners. If a condom breaks and you're even a little tiny bit unsure if you and your partner would test negative, wait until you get tested again. Etc. \n\nYou need to use protection and be safe - to do otherwise puts all your partners at risk for STIs. And that's not fuckin cool.\nLike it annoying to get the \"hey, you need to get tested\" message. But that's about it, it's annoying. Anyone would much rather they knew ahead of time.",

Especially girls you have sex with. \n\nOf course you don\u2019t \u2018owe\u2019 them anything and it\u2019s not technically any boundaries stated, but it just feels ICKY and I\u2019d lose any interest in a guy if that would happen to me. Or, if I really like him already \u2014 I\u2019d brush it off as \u2018fair\u2019, but deep inside I\u2019d be VERY hesitant on going further.",

Sure, girls may be more \u2018lucky\u2019 on dating apps and get more attention in general, but there\u2019s a line there. \n\nIf we\u2019re talking first date \u2014 sure, fine, no worries. If you\u2019re both looking just for fun \u2014 also cool, all\u2019s good. But seeing each other as in you\u2019re past first dates stage, talking to, having several dates which are openly romantic\u2026 Once again, you do you, and that\u2019s honestly fair, as I stated earlier \u2014 but it comes down to how the other person might feel on the other side of this story. \n\nTo finish it all, if I was that first girl from two weeks ago and we had kissed, and after I\u2019d learnt you\u2019re going on another date \u2014 I\u2019d get the hell out of this story.",

After 3 or 4 dates, though, texting all day, etc, you have to choose to keep talking to someone because their feelings can develop. It's respectful to let them know that either you aren't interested or are only looking for sex and nothing more.. \n\nHowever, just because you know some girls, IRL who only see one person at a time doesn't make it a standard. I think the biggest factor is, did they meet face to face, or through Tinder, etc... there's a true typical trope in romance movies, regardless of sex, about a person fighting with at least one other potential prospect to win his/her heart.\n\nMost girls I've spoken with who used Tinder talked to multiple guys at once to some extent. Hell, after I found my ex wife cheating on me, she had her, and im quoting her here, \"rotation of guys to fuck\"\n\nMy current partner openly admitted that until it started getting serious between us, she was going on dates still. Not when we agreed to be exclusive, but when it was becoming a weekly thing between us. Im not stupid. I know she had sex with people before me. \n\nI've come to realize 99% of people using dating apps are dating at least 2 or 3 people. That's just the way it is. I dont think it's bad until you are two months in and assume you are the only one they are seeing. \n\nBut the other comments saying \"just fuck em all, the women are anyways. So, who cares? \" are gross. Just like the women fucking all the other dudes too. It goes both ways.",

We typically don\u2019t end up trashed with people we really enjoy and are comfortable around, because we\u2019re too busy talking to chug lol\n\nActually edited to add one thing: I really liked a guy about a year ago and got really nervous for our date so I had a drink before\u2026(do not recommend). Then, we continued drinking. Let\u2019s just say by midnight (date started at like 4 pm lol) I was an incoherent mess. The next day I had the same feeling you\u2019re having, like a serious life re-evaluation. He didn\u2019t text at all the next day.

        "text": "What do you make of this?\n\nI (29f) have seen this guy (30m) 5 times since our first date 2 weeks ago. In person, he\u2019s so sweet, attentive, and seems very clearly interested in me and not just for sex (we haven\u2019t slept together yet and he hasn\u2019t pushed at all). He also seems anxious and nervous around me in a cute way. He plans cute and intentional dates. I just met his friends and he seems so proud to introduce me to people he knows and seems very in tune with his emotions (had been upfront about being depressed right now and grieving a family member who passed a little over a month ago). We stay up all night talking and cuddling and just having so much fun.\n\nBUT he rarely texts or texts back way later or even the next day and he doesn\u2019t seem very talkative. I have an anxious attachment style, so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m reading into him not texting very much (when we\u2019re not together, I wonder if he even likes me bc he doesn\u2019t seem to want to talk), or if this is a red flag. Haven\u2019t been with someone like this before. It\u2019s also only been 2 weeks, so idk if this is normal.\n\nAre there men who don\u2019t like to text much but are genuinely interested? \n\nEDIT: typed my age as 39, but I\u2019m 29, so fixed it",

                                "body": "My answer (M21):\n\nYes, at least in my case. Even when I\u2019m really attracted to someone and excited to meet them, I still take a while to text back usually 3days - 2weeks even over the most basic questions or compliments. Sometimes it takes me so long to reply to a simple message. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m not interested because I 1000% am. I just deal with a lot of anxiety and overthinking always feeling the need to be perfect in my responses. For some reason, I\u2019m a lot more confident and present in real life than over text.\n\nIn the past three months, I tried talking to three girls I used to go to school with. Here\u2019s how each situation played out:\n\n1. M (21)\nShe was great to talk to. I actually enjoyed the conversations and asked a lot about her life, like what she was doing for work or school. I even asked about her favorite shows and watched a few of them to feel more connected. I didn\u2019t take forever to reply to her because I didn\u2019t want to come off as rude I was genuinely interested in dating her. But when I asked if she was open to a relationship, she gave a long explanation that basically meant no. After that, she kept messaging me like normal, still liked all my stories, and the last thing she told me I was the sweetest guy she had ever talked to. I appreciated it, but I didn\u2019t see the point in continuing telling or even reading the full message. Especially since she doesn\u2019t want a relationship, I\u2019m not going to keep texting. I don\u2019t want to be \u201cjust friends\u201d with someone I\u2019m really into.\n\n2. S (21)\nI started talking to her by asking if she went to our middle school. She said yes but didn\u2019t remember me, and asked to see me in picture so I sent a photo. Her reply was \u201cYou look like a model,\u201d which totally caught me off guard. I didn\u2019t know how to follow up. It felt like I would get a yes if I asked her out, but that also made me feel pressure to live up to some expectation. I ended up not saying anything and also leaving on delivered because I got too nervous.\n\n3. C (21)\nShe lives in the same city as me, and we have a lot of shared interests like anime, gaming, and cosplay. I followed her and she followed back. I tried to start a conversation, but she left me on read. Later, she liked a photo I posted, so I gave it another shot and sent her a compliment. I said something like, \u201cYou\u2019re very pretty, I hope you have a good day.\u201d She replied, \u201cThanks so much! You too mate.\u201d I had no idea how to respond after that. Looking back, I realize that message probably came off as a conversation ender, and I didn\u2019t know how to save it. So I stopped texting again.\n\nSo yes, some guys take forever to text back even when they are interested. In my case, it\u2019s not about playing games. It\u2019s just that texting makes me anxious and I get in my own head. I\u2019m usually way better in person.",

How we communicate as we begin to navigate a relationship does often set the tone for how communication patterns will be between the two. So if this is something that you aren\u2019t used to, you could lightly bring it up next time you are together! Even just from a curiosity standpoint of something like \u201ctexting vs calling - what do you prefer?\u201d or another general question, not so much about how little he texts you. \nAnd maybe his response could help you determine whether or not it feels like a red flag",

We didn\u2019t really talk much until high school tho because she did the same sport as my brother and they became good friends. Since my freshman year, we started talking and we\u2019ve been decent friends too but we never really talk unless my brother (M20) is there because she\u2019s closer with him. \n\n I know she barely even sees me as a friend, but I\u2019ve always liked her and idk what to do. I can almost guarantee that she\u2019d reject me, so I don\u2019t really wanna take that risk. She knows I\u2019m a very awkward guy, but she\u2019s always really cool and nice about it. If I told her how I felt, I know there\u2019s a very very high chance she rejects me. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any advice for not being able to ask someone out, but trying to basically stop liking them.\n\n There\u2019s only been two \u201csigns\u201d which I feel like we\u2019re not even signs at all. One was when it was a cold night and she forgot a jacket. My brother offered his, but she said that \u201cit\u2019d be weird\u201d and rejected. A little while later, I offered her mine and she wore it for the rest of the night. I doubt this means anything, but idk. The other \u201csign\u201d is that she kinda \u201csticks up for me\u201d sometimes. Like if my brother is saying smth about me she\u2019ll kinda help me out. \n\n Tl;dr: I (M18) have known this girl (F19) for years, but I\u2019ve always liked her and I know she probably doesn\u2019t like me so idk what to do.

I saw her at the meetings a few times, but never talked to her until we volunteered to help out with a club activity. Since then I was trying to talk to her more, get to know her better, etc. Eventually she sends me a text saying that she knows I'm interested in her, but that she doesn't feel the same way and never will. I say cool, that's fair, and apologized for making her feel uncomfortable if she ever did.\n\nAnd guess what? Now we don't talk anymore.

How much regret and hurt would linger if you never tried?\n\nI've been in this situation before in my past, too. Among the times I didn't try, I later regretted. And many of the one where I did try, I was rejected and discovered she wasn't quite the right person for me anyways- it still stung- but I had clarity. (Sometimes they were already taken\u2014that was just embarrassing\u2014except for one odd moment when a girl tried to suggest breaking up with her partner to be with me, which pushed me away so fast\u2014haha.)

We live close (10\u201315 mins walking distance), so meeting has been convenient, though we rarely go out of our area. For the past 2 months, he\u2019s been dealing with family issues, making it harder to meet.\n\nHe works late, hits the gym around 10pm, and sleeps at 3am. I\u2019m a morning person\u2014wake at 5:30\u20136am, gym, then work.\n\nThis weekend, I planned a Sunday morning hike. To make it easier for him, I asked if he could go to the gym earlier on Saturday, then come over around 9\u201310pm, have dinner that is cook for him and sleep at my place so I could wake him early.\n\nInstead, he stopped by briefly before the gym just to say hi. We both went to gym together \u2014me back by 11:30pm, him by 1am. He had dinner I made and  I suggested one of us sleep on the sofa to get proper rest, but he refused. we ended up staying up till 5am making out and talking. \n\nI still woke at 7am to prep, he got up at 8am, but forgot his hiking clothes, so we agreed to meet later at the station. I made tea and toast for him while he was getting ready\u2014but he fell asleep and wouldn\u2019t wake up no matter what I did. Now he\u2019s asking to go on Monday (a workday), but I\u2019m not willing to take leave.\n\nI\u2019m feeling hurt. I planned the hike, cooked, adjusted my schedule\u2014but it feels like he didn\u2019t respect the effort. Am I overreacting? Or is it fair to feel let down that he couldn\u2019t wake up once for a date I planned, when I\u2019ve stayed up late for him multiple times?\n\n",

Everyone is different but these are my first thoughts. \n\nThis all depends on how often you go from either coast.  It can be very hard to have a relationship if you will be constantly coming and going for months at a time.\n\nI would personally spend what time you have here into just getting to know him better.  Gauge his interests and his personality with yours.  Figure out first if this is could be anything serious or if this is just a instinctive urge based on attraction. \n\nIf it turns out that this has good potential to turn to a relationship where you two grow with each other and inevitably get married then that is great and you should do what you feel is right.  \n\nHowever you will have to consider being bi coastal wont be a good fit for a long term relationship.\n\nYou will either have to sacrifice your bi coastal living and commit to one place or he will have to adapt and travel to and from with you. However this is hard as having a job that allows travel frequently for months at a time is truly hard to come by.  Most cases the only time this could work is if you both work remotely. \n\nIt would help to know why you live in both coasts and more of his situation for his job. \n\nPlay it by ear and see how things go slowly at first.  If things pickup and gain traction be prepared to make sacrifices or hope he will be able to sacrifice something to allow you guys to stay together either during travel or in one place.  \n\nSorry this is a read and probably doesnt answer everything your asking or thinking but as I said.

As long he's aware of your choice to live in two separate cities for now and is okay with a semi long distance LTR for portions at a time and is okay with commiting to you during this period then I say you have nothing to lose and everything to gain. \n\nI wish you two the best of luck and hope you guys find what your both looking for in each other.",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\nI'm a 21-year-old guy and I'm still single. Most of the time, I'm okay with it, but there are moments when I feel really lonely and wish I had a girlfriend \u2014 someone to talk to, share life with, and just feel emotionally connected.\n\nI see people around me in relationships, and it makes me wonder if I'm missing out on something. I do try to focus on myself, my studies/career, and hobbies, but that emotional void hits hard sometimes.\n\nIs this feeling normal at this age? Should I be doing something differently to meet people or build connections? Or should I just be patient and let things happen naturally?\n\nWould really appreciate some honest advice or experiences from others who've felt the same. Thanks in advance!",

I'm also fresh out a relationship and have kinda gotten past the rough of it but obviously it's still recent. \n\nI guess the girls would know best, if she says she needs time to just be and doesn't wanna take things further yet, should I put everything completely aside (which obviously might be the call for now anyway at least) or expect things to change in the future? She has very clearly said she loves talking to me still and the 'yet' is prominent, but I also am perfectly happy to give up now and focus on being a friend instead. I also don't know what yet means. Whether it means no sex, no relationship or no more kissing (We've only made out and slept-not meant sexually-together so far). I guess I'll find that out with time but for no I'm gonna suppose it means we're friends and nothing more. Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nI'm a patient lad and perfectly understanding of what the boat is made of rn, and also not desperate for anything. Just willing to wait and see where things go, but obviously clarity is a good thing, so feel free to share your thoughts.",

Realistically there will probably never be a relationship but even if there is...you can't start one with that much of an imbalance.\n\nShe's not ready yet.  You understand that.  You will check in with her and see if she changes her mind. But until then you are a single man and you are going to do everything a totally single man would be expected to do.........",

But realistically speaking you will be directly interacting with her for maybe a half hour a week (at best!!) for the near future.\n\nFor the 167.5 hours a week that you are not directly interacting with her, you are a totally single man and you will hit on, flirt with, whatever with anyone you otherwise would if she wasn't a factor whatsoever.",

She's always saying she misses me and tries to see me when she can. One time she said she loved me before hanging up, this caught me by surprise and im pretty sure it did for her too. I also send her things for couples like the \"you+me=us\" slideshows and one was where she was snuggling up on the man, her response was yes(meaning she wanted us to cuddle). Idk how to pursue this and very confused by what she's wanting, please please please help me in my confusing situation.",

She kept getting upset about it saying she's tired and wants to organize her house.\n\nWell i helped her organize and unpack everything she wanted to do a ljttle imbibing. So after agreeing we were going to stay at the apartment we cooked some food and her friend ended up calling. She wanted to go dancing tonight.\n\nI wasn't really interested in going at all and I could tell ky gf (whom is always gettijg onto me about my manic energy and also saying how tired she was) is now full of energy and full of life wanted to go dance.\n\nWell i told her im good but they can go without me. She didnt really give me much friction after mentioning that. So, anyways. She ended up getting ready and nice and dolled up which is a little annoying because she rarely ever does that for me. \n\nShe's been radio silent since which is fine its been only a couple hours, but then I saw she posted a selfie with her friend on her snap (thirst trap)\n\nSo anyways, im pretty upset about the whole ordeal for a multitude of reasons \n\nOh bonus she went to grab something from my car and found lipstick in there (that she left) and showed me them asking why I had them there\n\nI know that's a lot to unload but thoughts??",

My partner (M24) also weight lights maybe 3-4x a week maximum but eats out because it\u2019s convenient, so will rarely prep meals. I have tried to push him to become more disciplined in this area as I am, but sees it as me changing him. I have told him in all 2 years we\u2019ve dated he looks the same and I thought he\u2019d change but it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t push himself. I told him I prefer bigger men, and I have caused him to be very insecure, but i just don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever enjoy this lifestyle to the level I do. He\u2019s perfect in every other way, but sexually i\u2019ve become more detached because I think that lack of discipline is a turnoff in a way. Is this a compatibility issue?

        "text": "Just wanted to give a quick advice that will help anyone have a successful healthy relationship because i keep seeing these dumb tiktok videos of men and women saying things like \"My love language is making food for my man\" or \"My love language is physical touch so i massage my woman's feet\"...\n\n\nLove language isn't about how you show love, It's about how you recieve love, how you feel loved, how you understand that \"Wow, this person loves me\". Hence the name \"Lovelanguage\". Meaning, how you communicate to eachothers that you love and care for eachothers. Let's say you have a friend/family you deeply care about but their main language is Chinese and speak only very little to no English. You don't just communicate to them in English expecting them to understand you fully do you? Then get frustrated that they don't understand what you're saying. No, you learn their language and they learn your language more so both can more easily communicate and understand eachothers.\n\nSo for your next relationship, if you want it to be healthy and succeed, you need to learn your partners love language (again, how they feel loved) and do that, whether it's physical touch, words of affirmations, acts of service etc etc. And you also communicating what your love language is.\n\nThis is probably the number one reason why so many relationships fail, even my ex marriage when i was younger and dumber and more selfish. Why? Because we often hear men and women either in relationships or after a break up saying \"I did this and this for you but you never appreciated any of it or me\", which is a valid statement HOWEVER...None of what you do matters in a relationship if you're not filling up your partners love tank and the only way you do that is through their love language, not through your love language. \n\nFor women: Most guys including myself has physical touch and words of affirmations as our love languages, nr 1 being usually the main language. Not all guys but most. So it doesn't matter how many small cute gifts you give him or how often you make him delicious food and helping him out and wanting to spend a lot of time with him if you're not showing him love in the way he understands and recieves it...When you greet and says godbyes, take initiative sometimes to hug and kiss him passionately, take initiative cuddling up with him, random kisses and make outs, take initiative sometimes doing the freaky while clearly communicating to him with your body and language that you want him. Want him to feel even more loved and taken care of being crazy with you? Give him random out of the blue bj's outside of sex sometimes. Be better at complimenting and thanking him when he does something good that you like. Uplift him in your words and make it known to him that you're his biggest cheerleader because you believe he can do anything he sets his mind on. \n\n\nFor men: Most women I've met has quality time as main language and either recieving gifts or physical touch second, or a combo of all three. \nLikewise, it doesn't matter what you do unless you fill her lovetank through her love language, so if one of her love language is quality time, then take initiative spending quality time with her and be present, take her on planned dates sometimes which doesn't need to be expensive, just ve thoughtful. If her second language is gifts, then give her flowers from time to time, sometimes a cute lovenote, a small cute gift, bring her food, and if you can afford it, buy her something she really wishes sometimes \"just because\" and not waiting only for her bday, valentines day or anniversaries. \n\n\nBut too often we're too selfish and in our own bubble thinking and expecting people we're with that they ought to understand i love them because this and that when we're not even communicating that to them, and this goes for friendships and family aswell. I've made these same mistakes before and never will again. \n\nHope it helps\ud83d\ude4f\n\n",

He suddenly is more interested in things I have to say, waits for me to finish smoking during half time at trivia when he didn\u2019t used to, seems to always be talking to me when it\u2019s a big group, tries to make me laugh, banters with me, chooses a seat near mine, doesn\u2019t touch me with his hands but presses his legs/arm against me, stands next to me and chats as we are walking down a street etc.\n\nHe does have some autistic traits so it\u2019s hard to decipher (me, too, tbh). That makes him fairly inscrutable to me (both of our awkwardness)\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to figure this out because I have such an established enjoyment out of weekly trivia/our overall friend group and I don\u2019t want to ruin anything. But I like him and I am worried because he is so shy/borderline autistic that he won\u2019t ever say anything.\n\nWe only see each other 1-2 times a week at trivia.\n\n*Here is what I need to know:*\n\nWhat is the best way to let him know I\u2019m interested but also not make things awkward if he for some reason backs out/doesnt want to go forward? I have a few ideas but I want some advice. \n\nWould pulling him aside sometime I see him next and saying \u201cWould you like to meet up sometime outside of this\u201d be ok or should I wait for him to approach/say something else or should I be more direct like hey do you like me.\n\nI am bad at this but especially when it is a good friend.

We're having a little dance party in our basement and I have a feeling I'm going to want to kiss him. He's coming over early to help set up\u2014would it be appropriate to ask him if it'd be okay to say something like, \"hey, i have a feeling i'm going to want to kiss you later.

I wont immediately say to move on just because he is looking at 4 years.\n\nhowever if his offense is Heinous then I would truly tell you to cut your losses and move on because 4 years is no joke and that's fairly a long time to be waiting around for someone.  \n\nAgain tho wrapping back to his criminal charges... is this someone that would be healthy for you to commit too? If yes then here is my advice. \n\nHe may not like talking about his feelings but this is something you will need todo in a relationship of any kind.  So you NEED to let him know how you feel about his time he has to serve and how you dont want to move on.  He also has to talk about his feelings of how he feels about you waiting around for 4 years because again that's a long time and some people would rather someone they care for move on and continue to find their happiness rather than wait for them. \n\nSide note:  prison will change him more than you can imagine.  He very well may not come back the person you know or fell in love with now.  I think it's a bad idea but this is a conversation you two need to talk over extensively.",

        "post-author": "mayorblair",
        "text": "Hi all. I\u2019m new to posting stuff like this but i need advice. I (F26) been with my boyfriend (M28) for the past 4 years. I\u2019m a pretty shy person who doesn\u2019t have too many friends. I work from home so my social life isn\u2019t crazy. In high-school, i went to a private school and didn\u2019t click with most of the people there so i used to made a lot of my friends online. One of my friends i made we will call Adam (M27). I met Adam in 2014. Adam helped me get through a lot of dark times in my life and i consider him a really really good friend plus we would online game together a lot so we got really close. honestly i would consider him a best friend. I think of him like an older brother. My boyfriend isn\u2019t a fan of Adam being in my life and he had me cut him off. I understand him wanting this. but god i miss Adam. I deleted him from all social media besides his number. We have a collab spotify playlist from awhile ago and that\u2019s one of my only communication with him to this day. He randomly adds new songs and so do i. My boyfriend found this playlist the other day and got extremely jealous. I explained it\u2019s hard he just cut off a good friendship of mine but he didn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s just awkward.  i love my boyfriend so much and don\u2019t want to disrespect him, but Adam was there for me when no one else was and we are such great friends and it sucks. Adam understands why i cut him out but he does seem a bit sad about it. sometimes i secretly text him to see how he\u2019s doing but it\u2019s always super quick convo and i delete. for example adam texted me when his childhood dog died (i loved that dog so much and adam knew that) so of course we talked about that a bit. it makes me feel like im cheating when im not tho. he\u2019s just a friend. why does it make me feel so guilty? i just don\u2019t know what to do. do i need to cut off adam completely for my relationship to thrive? i also think about how how Adam told me one of his bucket list items is to meet me someday. There\u2019s no way i could make that work without pissing off my bf. so i just tell adam it won\u2019t happen. it sucks cuz i know adam and my boyfriend would actually be friends IRL but it\u2019s just the fact im friends with a guy i think. sorry this is a lot. any responses are appreciated. Note to add, Adam and I\u2019s relationship has never been sexual at all. he has had girlfriends throughout this all too. he has been single the last few years. during the small talk ive had with him (secretly) hes always rooting for my bf to propose cuz he says i deserve it. Also another side note my boyfriend is probably proposing soon. which i will say yes. i just don\u2019t want to cut off my best friend :(\nTL;DR My boyfriend hates my long distant guy friend so he made me cut him off",

Again, that's still my fault because I've asked out only a couple of women - I'm not that good at being social, think too much if and how to approach and most in my friend circle are already seeing someone.\n\nI realized I'm approaching 26 and likely won't find anyone by then. I feel kind of defeated and worry anyone who finds that out will be put off and my lack of experience and not knowing how to do stuff will screw me up.\n\nIs this a reasonable concern?",

It can be a little weird telling them where you want to go when they're paying, especially if they don't ask you where you want to go.\n\n So after a few dates where he pays, I will normally suggest a date and say \"My treat.\"  When I go out for a nice evening it's generally pretty expensive and layered: an event like a comedy show, then dinner,  then a bar for drinks/live music, then dessert or coffee to end the night. I don't want to out that on someone.\n\nIt also tells him how I can afford to treat myself and someone else. It gives him an indication of how I like to be treated if he intends on being in a relationship and paying for dates.  I make good money day trading and I have a budget for entertainment. When I go out I wanna enjoy myself have a good time and have whatever I want without worrying about money and if the guy can afford it.",

When it comes to dating, splitting the bill is like saying that you are only willing to pay for yourself and not him.  I've only ever refused to pay for a woman's half once in my life, and that was a very specific situation that was an outlier.  I would rather my date offer to pay for the whole date than just herself, because even though I won't take her up on it, I would at least appreciate the gesture that she's not looking like she's just out for herself.  I don't know, maybe I'm a reactionary.",

In college, they would always hit on her while I was just there. The only time a guy ever talked to me, it was by accident, he thought I was her!  \n\nI\u2019m looking for advice. Why does this happen? Is it just about who's more attractive? I\u2019ve never been in a relationship, and even though I want to, I don\u2019t have any options.\n\nAnd yes, she\u2019s the extroverted one and i\u2019m wayyy more reserved and serious.

If you are thinking \"I'd really like a guy to approach me.. but I feel anxious about social interactions with said guy\", that is going to come across in your body language and repel a lot of guys.   \n\nI don't know if this helps at all.. and that might not point to any solution for you.. but that is one perspective that might explain some of what you are experiencing.",

Given OP says they've only talked to one guy I'm a bit shocked, that means she's not talking to guys even just to be friendly, or joining conversations with a mixture of girls and guys. OP literally only talked about their looks.\n\nThe people who get approached the most are almost always the people who DO the most approaching. They project friendliness, or even just smile when they make eye contact and that triggers the other person to come up and talk, or they got approached by the friend a previous time and so they are comfortable coming up to chat. I think approaching others based just on \"they look good\" is actually super rare, and probably only model-gorgeous girls get that even if they are trying to be frosty.",

You will start to subtly come across as more friendly and open to chats with strangers. \n\nAnother parallel is I dance a lot, and some dancers have claimed they can detect other dancers by their posture and things.  Some of us constantly do these little micro dances even while grocery shopping.\n\nWhen I approach someone (whether platonically or a woman I\u2019m attracted to), some part of me is looking for these kinds of cues that they have social experience (or dance experience).  \n\nNobody wants a stiff, overly formal chat that feels like a corporate meeting.  We want it to be creative, fun, relaxed, and carefree.  And most of all, we want to feel the other person is open to chatting so we aren\u2019t bothering them and it\u2019s more likely we\u2019ll get a good reaction and engaging chat.\n\nIt\u2019s of course an imprecise science, we\u2019re dealing in probability, but these micro cues (aka body language) are all we have to go by.",

        "text": "Hi there, 18 never had a GF. I feel very left out to be honest. Most of my friends have had many experiences and are loosing their virginity to women, yet I haven\u2019t had my first kiss.\n\nA month ago, i met this beautiful girl at a party, and we chatted about music (we both love rock) until 5am! She asked for my snapchat and instagram, and she was actively making the first moves, initiating most convo and replying to my stories. So I asked her out to hang and she said yes!\n\nSo last week I went on my first date ever, took her out, bought her dinner. But it went okay, she opened up and talked about her past (including her ex) and other things for like 90% of the time, but she might of only really asked 5-6 questions about me. The convo didnt feel natural it was really really forced!\n\nI have tons of female friends but she is one of the few who showed any type of \u201cinterest\u201d.\nOther girls who have showed interest in me are the type to vape and party and stuff, not my type personally.\n\nAfter the date she did message me saying she had a good time but then after that she started being really dry and the convos have ended there. Haven\u2019t talked to her in two days now.\n\nI would say (honestly) im above average looking, i have a good physique, good eyebrows, style, scent, good guitar player and in bands. However I am only 170cm (5\u201d7). That might be why.\n\nI just dont know what to do, everybody says focus on themself. But at this point I have confidence in my looks(I workout often and eat super healthy). I have confidence among my female friends but I LACK romantic confidence, if that makes sense. I don\u2019t have the confidence to escalate things romantically like kissing like alotta guys do with random girls at partys. \nI dont know how to make romantic tension and Im afraid of it.\n\nJust need some advice. Willing to send photos to anyone if they have advice for looking better.",

It can also help to read some books or posts here on reddit that deal with first dates and physical escalation.\n\n4. You seem a bit too focused on your looks. If she lost interest, it doesn't seem to be looks-related. Like you said: the convo felt very forced. And this is probably the thing you need to focus on improving.\n\n5. Have you asked her out on a second date? Sometimes she might get dry in her responses if she thinks you're not into her. That can lead her to pull back. If she did most of the talking it seems like you maybe were a bit too passive and perhaps you seemed hesitant or disinterested to her. If she thinks you're not interested she will stop pursuing you.",

Women, generally, will want a man taller than them by at least a few inches (they like to be able to wear heels with their man).\n\nThat's something you can't control. Now that we're past that, let's look at what you CAN control.\n\nFirst of all, you're 18. You do not need to be taking girls to full-on dinner dates. Go bowling. Go for a walk in the park. Catch a movie. Get some froyo - whatever. But don't be sinking your bank account for a woman who may not even be interested in you.\n\nI will say that conversations about exes don't usually go well, and are often a red flag. Her not asking too much about you is natural though. Everybody loves talking about themselves, especially women, and you're young, so there's not much else to talk about. If she doesn't take ANY interest in you, that could be an issue. Otherwise, being a good listener goes a long way, so don't feel bad if you didn't talk much.\n\nHere's the most important thing, though: you need to make sure she knows you're interested in her, so you can see whether she's interested in you.\n\nWhat does that mean? Make a move. Go for the kiss.\n\nPeople get wrapped up in looking for the \"perfect moment\". It doesn't exist - you have to make it. Then you'll know whether things might move to the next level, or whether you're wasting your time.",

Ive never thought of me dating someone as a possibility because I get so flustered and it's embarrassing but I went on 2 dates and dated someone for a very short time (don't think it counts) but I feel like I'm missing out and I'm old enough to start considering on becoming proactive in getting over the fear or making it more possible for me to be in a relationship because I think fear holds me back. But some people told me to not try dating without building my self confidence or whilst I'm desperate. I am aware that I've been getting the urge to date someone more recently just cos all my friends are getting into relationships and have told me that I'm never gonna be ready and to just try but Idk if I should download a dating app (also have the irrational fear of seeing someone I know on there which is highly likely and it being awkward ) and me getting my heart broken and ruining my life ",

I\u2019ve been placed already, and the past few months I\u2019ve just been sitting at home - bored, unmotivated, and kind of emotionally stuck.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I really missed my chance or if it just wasn\u2019t meant to happen yet. I\u2019m not looking for anything dramatic - just the experience of being with someone, sharing love and support. It would\u2019ve meant a lot to have someone close during the ups and downs of these last few years.\n\nI don\u2019t have a strong social circle anymore, and I find it hard to open up or talk to new people. The idea of dating at work also feels complicated and risky, and all the advice out there just makes me feel more unsure.\n\nI'm not trying to complain - I just wish I knew how to take a real step forward here.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar spot at this stage of life? And if so, how did you start building those connections?\n\nEdit : I'm bad at making title so reposted \ud83e\udd72",

It's lazy, I understand it's low-hanging fruit, but you're more likely to get fired for harassment if things don't work out - and even if they DO work out, most places would take issue with coworkers publicly dating.\n\nWhat you need to do is go out into the world and meet women in your free time. Ideally, on weekends, probably at bars. You will run into other guys and girls in the same position as yourself, and social circles will not matter beyond the groups of people they came with. The positive to this is that nobody will care if you get rejected - and you WILL get rejected.\n\nYou just have to be willing to put yourself out there to endure the pain of rejection enough times to reach the point of success where things will start to click. The alternative is you go through life lonely because you're afraid of putting yourself out there.\n\nIt's your life, nobody cares nearly as much as you, so go do what you want to do.",

And I should emphasize, you need to make it happen. It won't happen randomly on its own. \n\nDating apps are going to be the natural step to at least putting yourself out there, seeing what kind of girls are interested (or not), and getting some dates. Work on approaching women in real life too. You'll actually be able to land better women in real life because apps distort people's perceived value, higher for women and lower for men.

I'll admit that I'm particularly detailed about cleaning my house before guests and I don't expect everyone to clean that much. BUT this was the first time there so I have to assume any further times will be a bit more relaxed. It smelled like dirt & old cat pee. There was a lot of general clutter, some laundry laying around and there was so much dust, dirt and (probably) cat hair against the wall all the way around the living room! The couch was torn up & just felt grimy, there was a blanket that I was afraid to touch even though I was cold, because I'm not sure it's ever seen a washing machine. When I got home, I washed my clothes and took a shower because I just felt dirty, although I'm sure that was just in my head.\n\nThere is no way I can go back to his house, I'm terrified to think what his bedroom must look & smell like. So, do I tell him \"I can't handle how dirty your house is\" or just \"this isn't going to work out\"? It's not my job but I feel like I might be doing him a favor if I tell him because I'm not the only one who is going to have problems with that and he's otherwise fun to be with.",

OP would just be enabling him to pull the wool over the eyes of his next date.  \n\nLeave that man rolling around in his pig sty, so that the next woman can also be forewarned. Who knows!

It's okay to not be compatible with someone. Just cause someone goes on a couple dates doesn't mean they're now obligated to stick  around, roll up their sleeves and get to work fixing this person when they realize this person does not have the values, interests, lifestyle, etc they do. \n\nIt's okay to acknowledge a person is not the right one.

That was a red flag but the second red flag was the exterior of his house. It was dirty and not appealing. \n\nThe interior was my final red flag. Dirty, like it had never been cleaned since he moved in. The kitchen and the sink piled up with dirty dishes, dog hair on every surface and counter, the sofa was dirty and grimy and the carpet had so much debris that it was a muddy color. The house had a moldy and wet dog smell. There was nowhere to sit without sitting on dog hair. I was gagging.\n\nI made an excuse that I had forgotten that I had an early morning shift and needed to leave. He took me home but tried to set up another date. I claimed I didn't have my calendar with me and would call him. He tried many more times to get me to go out on another date but it was clear why he wasn't successful with the ladies. \n\nI never said a word about his house but I probably should have. It would have given him the opportunity to actually clean it and maintain it before having company over. But as a 21 year old, I didn't know what to say.

You have to have about the same living space alone as you would as a normal family, but you don't have any income advantages like in a marriage. Accordingly, you quickly find yourself in a situation of being overwhelmed. Who knows how committed he is to his children in other ways.\nUltimately, it comes down to setting priorities and not everyone is selfish enough to cut out time with the children and clean up instead.\nBy the way, the priority can change completely or even reverse when people live with others.\n\nSo... talk about it and see if it's cleaned up the next time you log in. Then you will immediately notice how important you are to him.",

Lately, he's been lying to me about his late-night activities for no reason, but later tells me the truth. \n\nThis past week he's been really sick and was complaining about how terrible work was and how he just wanted to go home to bed. Then later when I asked what he was doing, he said he ended up going to his friend's house to chill (and NOT drink) and was about to head home at 10pm. At 2am he texts me and says a bunch of his friends got into a physical altercation at someone's birthday party in town. I was really confused because he never mentioned anything about being in town..but I didn't bring it up and just told him to tell me tomorrow because I was trying to sleep.\n\nAnyways, he messages me in the morning, weirdly affectionate, asking to see me. I go and visit him and he starts telling me about the night. He said that he went to the bar after work to have drinks with his mates, then attended some birthday party, and got home at 4am and couldn't sleep all night because a lot of drama went down. Why did he say he was going to his friends' house when he went out to a bar and some birthday party? I kept quiet, but it's been bugging me all day. This has happened a few times, but he always ends up telling me what happened.\n\nI'm confused because why lie about it in the first place? I'm a super chill person, like I don't ask to look at his phone, see his location or anything. But I appreciate honesty. I don't think this has to do with cheating, but how do I approach this conversation without sounding crazy?",

You value honesty even above behavior. You don't want to be his mom, so he shouldn't hide being naughty from you. That's a response to his own guilt or a reaction to a past relationship that he expects you to act the same as. Tell him point blank he doesn't have to lie to you, that you take offense to the lieing behavior and not the drinking and rowdy night. And, because it's a few months, you can say the relationship is evolving and you are looking at how you coexist and not just have fun together. The first time is testing behavior, he's seeing how you react. So make clear the results of his test. And in the future if he doesn't adjust his behavior to your expectations and not this little kid naughty type shit, then you put it in the strong negative column and consider if it's worth it.",

But if you don\u2019t have time or you have to start somewhere else, here\u2019s a trick.\n\nThe only feeling that kills relationship 100% of the time is disdain. So basically, you have to build up enough disdain to keep you from going back to him, but not enough you could never be around him (if you want to keep this friendship). It won\u2019t happen immediately overnight, and you might have to get some distance, but if you really work on it, it will work. Use whatever means necessary to really truly convince yourself. \u201cHe used you\u201d, \u201che\u2019s not that great\u201d, \u201che always did that thing that annoyed me\u201d, \u201ci\u2019m so happy I can find someone better\u201d, \u201che\u2019s not a good boyfriend\u201d, \u201cif he can change his mind so quickly, I don\u2019t want him\u201d, \u201che tricked me and I will never let it happen again\u201d. The goal is not hate, it\u2019s disdain! Disdain kick starts your self-esteem because it already implies a sense of superiority. So don\u2019t think \u201cI hate him because of what he did or who he is\u201d, think \u201che is beneath me because of all those things he did\u201d. And repeat that everytime you can, get friends to say it too, whatever works so you internalize it.\nAnd then after a while, you\u2019ll realize spending so much time thinking about him is a waste and you\u2019ll know you are moving on.\nGood luck!",

Think about it. You said you didn't want to make things public because you'd be teased which, first of all, how old are you all? It sounds like you're all adults.

The thing I don\u2019t want is to bring it up and it ruin our friendship, as I am unsure if she likes me back. The only time she flirts with me is when no one else is around, and even then it\u2019s light flirting nothing too crazy or serious. My problem is I genuinely cannot stop thinking about this girl. She is on my mind 24/7 no matter what I\u2019m doing. I can\u2019t get her out of my head to the point it\u2019s kinda messing with my mind and I\u2019m genuinely unsure of what to do because I don\u2019t want to ruin the friendship we have created. I am at a loss and need some help. The biggest problem that I have when it comes to \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just ask her out\u201d is because we work together. \n\nAnd listen I know everyone always just says \u201crip the bandaid off and tell her\u201d but that really scares me. And like I said I really don\u2019t want to mess up what we already have friendship wise. This is going to sound very childish but I do not want to make the first move, because I don\u2019t want to ruin anything. So I feel like if she makes the first move then I will not have to worry about ruining what is already there. \n\nA buddy of mine said give it another 2-3 months and if nothing happens in those few months you know nothing will ever happen. But I am not sure if mentally I can wait those few months. I personally feel like her and I have grown very close together and I\u2019ll be honest she\u2019s the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last thing I think of when I go to sleep. I honestly don\u2019t know what scares me more. That I think of her that often or that I fear she doesn\u2019t even remotely think of me the same way. \n\nI just have really fallen for this girl. I understand I\u2019m not that old. We are both only 25 but I have been in my fair share of relationships. I can honestly say I have never felt or acted this way for any girl I have ever dated. I honestly wish there was a way I could tell if she feels the same way without there being a chance I ruin the friendship we have built. \n\nI just honestly feel like this is weighing on my mind in a way that is affecting my mind and I really don\u2019t know what to do. If someone could help me I would greatly appreciate it.",

        "text": "Hi, I am curious if anyone else has gone through a similar situation. I met a guy through mutual friends last summer, and we ended up dating 10 months. For context, I am 36f childless, and he is 39m divorced with two daughters under 10 years old.\n\nWhen we met, he was still separated but legally married. He indicated interest in dating but said he wasn't yet ready for bf/gf titles, which I assumed was because the divorce wasn't yet finalized.\n\n  \nClose to 4 months into getting to know each other/dating, his divorce was finalized. We would text daily and meet up 1-2x a week. He also had shared custody and a busy work schedule so we didn't see each other all the time but fairly regularly.\n\n  \nHowever, he still was not ready for a \"titled\" relationship over 8 months into the relationship. His reasoning was that a \"titled\" relationship indicated serious commitment/pressure, settling down which he was not yet ready for at the time. When we met, he mentioned he needed at least a year to \"settle down\" and wait until his finances were back on track (lost a lot of money in legal fees, alimony payments which will go on for a few more years).\n\n  \nInitially I was understanding and patient, but after 8 months I did start to question why he wouldn't call me \"girlfriend\" or at least introduce me to friends, but he claimed still wasn't ready. I told him I was hurt by that.\n\n  \nHe kept saying he liked our connection and had no interest in anyone else. We acted like a \"couple\" by going on dates, physically intimate, etc but he still could not fully commit. He said he was in a men's group to work on his issues and try to  address his commitment issues.\n\n  \nHe even suggested at one point we take time off to wait until \"he's fixed\" and said he didn't want to stop me from finding happiness.\n\nAfter 9.5 months he finally referred to me to his friend as his \"girlfriend\" which I was happy about. He said he was glad to know me and really liked me.\n\n  \nBut he indicated feeling guilty that he wasn't really available (kids/divorce/busy work schedule) and said at times I deserved better.\n\n  \nThen earlier this month, he wanted to meet. He had tight time restrictions saying he could only meet for an hour before meeting his friend. I got a bit frustrated and said \"maybe I deserve better\" and he said \"to be honest you might\" he said his life is difficult and I deserve someone with NO restrictions. He mentioned he felt he was holding me back.\n\n  \nWhen we met in person, he ended the relationship saying he needs to be alone and that I should \"know my worth\" and said goodbye. He hugged me and said \"I'm so cute.\"\n\n  \nIt's been over 3 weeks, and I find myself still sad about this. We texted every day, and he was a good companion. \n\nI agree it is best to find someone who can provide a more normal relationship, but it still hurts.\n\n  \nHas anyone been through something similar? If so, how do you cope?\n\n  \n",

I was married 14 years and started dating him before my divorce was finalized. I started dating because I missed intimacy. I wasn't looking for a relationship but gladly jumped into one with him because...I know myself. I knew I was ready to be fully present and committed to the right person. That person just so happened to find me before the divorce was legally finalized. Im exceedingly happy with this person. 0 regrets.\n\nThat's what's bothering me about your situation. What was his end goal regarding dating someone before he was \"fixed\"? I hate to generalize, but I find that many men will jump into dating as a solution for their problems well before they ever look at therapy. I had been in therapy for a long time before my divorce was filed and I knew myself. Sounds like you were dating someone who doesn't know who they are or what they want and was looking for an answer to their issues in another person. When YOU or your presence in his life didn't fix him, he got weird. Im sorry that happened to you but this is truly a him problem, not you.",

He dated me because he liked me and enjoyed my company, and I'm sure the intimacy as well which he said was the best he had (his marriage lacked intimacy).\n\nBut given that he had a very traumatic/messy divorce with a woman he was married to for 7 years before they separated (with false allegations from her, insane legal fees) in a situation where he felt abandoned and used financially, I do not think he was fully ready to commit to me or any woman for that matter at this time. His divorce proceedings was very complicated and and took 2.5 years to get settled.\n\nPrior to me, about 6 months after he  officially separated from his ex wife, he dated another woman for similar time frame of about 10 months he said. He claims that relationship did not work out because, although the woman was also divorced (2x with two pre-teens) so she shared his lifestyle, they were not on the same page, and she wanted to move in with him and have him meet her kids after several months of dating. And he was not ready for that commitment and didn't like that she was trying to \"change him.\". And he said she had baggage and was not someone he probably would have settled down with... he said he now thinks he doesn't want to date a woman with kids because he doesn't like the idea of a \"blended\" family and too much complications.\n\nWe had talked about his situation. I think he needs more time to process everything and delve into therapy to understand himself and what he wants. Probably won't be ready for awhile is my guess.",

Lost 55kgs, attempting to learn a martial art. etc.\n\nPart of this was to try dating, at first I tried a dating app. And someone messaged me, and you'd think that would be good, but fuck me the fight or flight response went sooo hard I deleted my account and whole app. I've tried this three times now and its always been the same.\n\nI look back too in the last few years and realize there have been times were people have given me signs, hell one even said \"I think xxx and you would be a good couple\" and I just laughed it off, but I think she was actually asking for that friend.\n\nI think this came ahead yesterday when I was walking outside myself and stood next to this fire barrel (we have this light event in my city) and I was by myself, there was lots of free barrels around but this really gorgeous girl came and stood at mine. And instead of saying hi, or saying nothing, I just smiled and walked awayyyyy with that flight response back. And like I get she might not have actually liked me, but I still think my reaction is not normal.\n\nAny advice? Anyone been through similar? Thanks",

Sometimes it did. But what happens is you slowly begin to care less about whether you get rejected, and then you can enjoy the conversation without being dependent on the outcome.\n\nI've been doing that for a long time, and it becomes EXTREMELY powerful - because you're competing against men who cannot do that, and will never meet the women they want to talk to because of it.",

He's the type who needs to ask her permission to go out and have fun with his friends. He's the type to apologize when he's not wrong. I have a family friend who's like that - his wife gives him an allowance, otherwise, he doesn't have access to funds.\n\nYou do not want that for yourself.\n\nAdditionally, most women will detest you for this because most women are looking for a MAN, not a BOY. They want you to lead them, they don't want to be your 2nd mother.\n\nI'm sure that's not the answer you want to hear, but I don't think you'll be happy in this day and age by being lazy and taking a backseat to your partner.",

Now, she texted yesterday and I was again bored so I also flirted. \n\nI didn\u2019t realise but in her head she is viewing this something that can be long term and a \u201crelationship\u201d. But, i just had a breakup and i am not in that space to make a long term commitment. \n\nThe problem is I didn\u2019t tell her this because i didn\u2019t have the courage amidst all the intense flirting and kind of talked to her the whole day yesterday. \n\nNow, today after waking up I realised I am making a huge mistake I don\u2019t view this as a relationship but she does. \n\nWhat should i do? Please I need some solid advice so that I don\u2019t look like a jerk while letting her down. She seems really into me for some reason. \n\nUpdate: \nI grew some balls and told her that in clear words as you all generously advised that I am not looking to \u201cdate\u201d anyone and would just want to be friends and nothing more. She said  \u201cIt\u2019s okay I understand thanks for letting me know. I had fun talking to you and would love if we continue being friends and see where this goes\u201d.  It really was that simple. \n\nAlthough I am not fully convinced we\u2019re on the same page yet. I have some suspicions due to a few things she said afterwards i\u2019ll confirm tomorrow and let you guys know if you care. \nThanks! \n\n\n",

During our first months of our relationship i saw his ig dms talking to multiple girls and theres this one girl who rlly caught my attention, so i scrolled up their convo and saw my boyfriend said \"saranghae\" to her. He's being defensive and said that the girl is only her girl bestfriend and the saranghae was only a joke. i cheated back and i admit that i was wrong. I only want to revenge so that he knows what i felt when i saw those messages. i apologized while he didnt apologize when i caught him. Then while i was scrolling my fyp, it is full of cheating issues and theres this video that struck me the most, the context of the video is having a revenge on ur cheater bf is the best feeling ever blablabla. so we talked abt it again and he's still being defensive as fuck about it again and said she's just a friend but when i told him if i said i love you to my guy friends is it okay with him and he said no so im like??????? wtf. We go no contact for like 2 days and i messaged him if this is his way of break up w me  bc he never did that. Do u think breaking up w him is the better solution to this?? because he never admit that he's wrong anyways so im kinda like wasting my time talking to a high ego man\n\n\n\np.s. he ghosted me for 6 days when we were dating  but he messaged me again so idk if this is also his type of ghosting bc i rlly wanna break up w him and he doesnt want soooo... ya",

        "text": "My name is L, been dating this girl, Y for 7 months. I meet her in an online, after a bad divorced where my ex wife cheated on me. I was left alone as a single father with a son. Everything with Y was so magical, when i first know her, i can feel she is genuine and honest to me. She warn me and told me that she has a distance relationship for 12 years ( I am also in a distance relationship with her )but has stop meeting each other for 2 years and she claim she dont love him anymore, looking at her social media, its indeed does not have any record with him for 2 years. Due to she being jobless, the so called bf is providing her money every month, but i was crazy and decided to meet up with her. We ended up having sex. For the past 7 months we meet, everything developed naturally, sometimes she would spend some money on me, and we had sex everytime we meet, more than 20 times.  \nHowever i am still not very comfortable as I want exclusivity with her but she still contacting him due to money. One day she decided to give up on him and say she will break up with him but asking me to be a substitute to provide to her as she is not capable to find money herself. I love her very much and agree to it, she show me msg they break up and that guy voice\u2019s was crying and begging her. I feel horrible, but i know this is for a better future for both of us. \nI even meet her family and parents and had dinner together.\n\nDue to my bad past, i still having problem trusting words, so i ask her permission to check on her phone, at first she is ok but lately she suddenly become defensive saying i am being controlling. One day i saw her ex msg her in fb messenger saying that he will work harder and improve himself, then i find out that she is still receiving money from him from a part time that he given her to do. Even I meet with her family, she refuse to post anything about me in social media, this break my confidence. I am begging to suspect she is using me as a fool and been taking money from both me and him. We had a huge argument recently and she block me, i couldnt contain my emotions and send all the intimates pictures i toke with her to her ex bf. I regret it immediately and try to recall but its too late, just second later, she contact me and we are ok again, those pic that i send to her ex, i kept it as secret as she told me she ignored all his msg. 1-2 days later, she snap at me and told me her ex bf contacted him and say she is cheating even before breaking up with him and claim because he contact her through working phone, and the only things that they still share is the part time they do and she was slowly planning to quit until things more stable with me. I feel very insecure, i was being cheated before and now i am with a girl that cheated with me, what he did to him he can do to me too. She promised me she will only loyal to me, and say she let me hold her hand infront of her parents and say she give up on a man that providing for her for the past 10 years to be with me, and say she love me. Am I a red flags from doing all this or is she a red flags? ",

        "text": "I've been voluntarily single for a few years since breaking things off with my ex. Now I'm ready to meet someone new and I'm coming across an issue I've never had before. \n\nI'm turning 40(M) this year and the problem I'm encountering has to do with how others perceive my age. I've been trying to making connections where possible and appropriate but I'm mostly only getting attention from women under 30 and sometimes under 25. However, I'm not interested in dating anyone more than 10 years below or above my age (preferably within a 5 year age gap). \n\nThe actual issue with my appearance is that I look like I'm in my mid to late twenties. Whenever the subject of age comes up I always ask people to guess my age and it's always dramatically younger than my real age. I don't make any conscious effort to appear or act younger. I even have a full beard and a bit of an old man limp from an old injury. \n\nWhat can I do to clearly present myself as a 40y.o. and find a woman closer to my age?\nAnd to the women reading, what circumstances and settings would you feel comfortable having a man my age trying to get to know you better? (I'm starting to feel a bit self conscious about coming off the wrong way)",

Like one time my friend went to the bathroom and immediately we both just stared at our phones. I tried to crack a joke or two and she did laugh but overall it felt so so awkward haha. \n\nAnd I was like OK that\u2019s fine she probably just thinks I\u2019m weird or something. A month goes by and I\u2019m sitting and working with AirPods in and I see her walk past me from the corner of my eye. She does this a couple times then finally comes up to me and she goes \u201cdo you remember who I am\u201d? We end up making small talk and she says she\u2019s \u201clooking for a building\u201d and asks for my help and I go \u201coh yeah just go left and you\u2019ll find it\u201d. She kind of hovers a bit but then leaves. \n\nAbout an hour or two later I see her come back to the part of campus I\u2019m in (our work campus is very large) and she walks up to me and starts talking about how she never thought she\u2019d run into me again and she tried looking me up in our internal work tool but couldn\u2019t find me. And then says \u201cwe should totally hang out\u201d. Overall she seems completely different from week 1? Like very confident and warm towards me so I\u2019m taken aback. I suggest lunch and she smiles and says she\u2019s free on Thursday and then asks me some more stuff about what I\u2019ve been up to, if I live alone, etc. \n\nI\u2019m just a little surprised. I hate assuming stuff, but is this more than just being friendly? Was she\u2026hitting on me? I feel like it\u2019s not possible because idk women are usually not this forward right? But also we\u2019re on completely different teams and work in different buildings so she definitely doesn\u2019t have to be my friend and it sounds like she already has lots of friends. This girl is very, very pretty too. \n\nI\u2019m really not good with this stuff, so would appreciate any advice. Thanks!",

        "text": "I (20F) met this guy (19M) at my college about 3 weeks ago. All of our interactions have been very nice, but I didn't start developing feelings til about a week ago. He's very sweet and kind, and something about his energy draws me to him. I feel very comfortable and safe around him. It's been a while since I've been this drawn to someone.\n\nThe thing is, I thought I was a lesbian before I fell for him. Unexpectedly falling for a man doesn't bother me too much, but I'm concerned I'm lying to myself and I don't actually have feelings for him. (I've done this with men before). Like I said, he's very kind and sweet, so I'm scared my feelings are just me liking the validation and not actually him. Though I am concerned about this, I don't think its true. I can't stop thinking about him in ways beyond platonic and I am very compelled to be close to him (I'm mostly making this post is just because I wanna talk about him).\n\nHere's the thing- I needed a place to stay this summer between spring and fall semester. He lives off campus and he's letting me sublease with him during this time, while his roommate is gone. I haven't personally observed that he's interested in me, but according to my friends, when we're together in a group, its basically just him and me talking and he isn't really paying attention to anyone else. My best friend clocked that I was into him before I even admitted it to myself, and she thinks the feelings are mutual. There have been a few instances where him and I have sat very close to each other, almost touching.  We've talking about how crazy it is that we've known each other for such a short amount of time. The 1-2 weeks I'm not gonna see him feel like years, and he was bummed when he learned i wasn't moving in right away. I also know he likes black women (i'm black).\n\nI was in denial about liking him until the last night of the semester, so I wasn't trying to flirt (on purpose) or gauge how he felt about me. I move in with him in about a week. If he is interested, how stupid would it be to pursue him? I'm happy to go into more detail if needed.",

Well there is this new girl F23  who works in the bakery right next to where I work. She's been there for a few months now and she's more shy and reserved type. Anyways we've been hanging out and talking the past month and a half or so. It felt kind of like we had it off since we first started talking. We have almost everything in common. Things I thought were embarrassing that I liked she likes too. \n\nWell anyways, we've gone to the arcade together a few times and I've driven her back and forth to work a few times. Her last car got in a wreck so she's been having to someone drive her for the past few months. She lives with her dad but during the week she works she couch surfs at local friends. A couple are guys she stays with but she told me she stays in separate rooms. And from what I can tell they are like family. \n\nEvery time we talk she makes very good eye contact which I'm not used to. She laughs genuinely hard at almost all my jokes. The other day she randomly bought me a drink I like without even asking. So she pays attention. Today I was driving her to work and she said she heard rumors about us since we have been talking. She told them \"whoa slow down, I don't date until I've known someone for at least a year\" I like that she doesn't Rush and the fact that she even told me that is nice.\n\nI just wanted to get that out. I just don't want to think there is something and get let down or screw something up because I didn't take the hints. I guess for now I'll keep doing what I am doing and see how things feel. Feel free to give any advice or critique anything!",

I\u2019ve been on and off the app since a 3-year relationship ended pretty badly. I\u2019m trying to figure out what kind of vibe I\u2019m giving off and why things don\u2019t seem to be clicking.\n\nMost people I match with either ghost before the first date or aren\u2019t upfront about emotional availability or having kids (which I\u2019m personally fine with; I don\u2019t like being lied to, yk?). I typically get 1\u20132 likes every few weeks, so I wanted to crowdsource some thoughts on what might be going wrong or what could be improved.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ve copied and pasted information from my profile.   \nDating me is like: late-night anime binges, hyping K-pop comebacks, and random 2 a.m. conversations about random meme lore. My therapist would say that: I\u2019m funny, loyal, and prone to overthinking, but at least I bring A+ themed snacks/ homemade desserts to the table. Ways to win me over: make me laugh, match my energy, and listen to my random Ted talk rambles about anime/video game news\n\nHere is a little context about me:\n\n* I\u2019ve got a soft spot for rhythm games, true crime conversations, and dogs (both shih tzus, 2 and 6) who look like they\u2019re judging you.\n* I also use a light compatibility form for matches; it\u2019s short and playful, nothing intense, just something I saw others doing and wanted to try out to save both people\u2019s time and energy. I don\u2019t lead with it unless we\u2019re vibing!\n\nI'd love any feedback on my vibe, anything that stands out (for better or worse), or any suggestions for areas I could improve.\n\nEdit - I\u2019ve taken out the loyalty and \u2018making me laugh\u2019 comments on my profile due to them being too generic ",

The lack of quality time and being late piled up and I couldn\u2019t take it anymore when he told me he was on his way to dinner with my parents and I called out his bluff when he wasn\u2019t. \n\nHe got defensive, said I\u2019m spying on him, and assuming stuff. \n\nBack story, we bought two houses together which was rented out. They have cameras, and lately they have been going offline whenever he\u2019s around so I went to investigate. \n\nI reached out earlier today asking if he wanted to talk and he didn\u2019t reply, so I went to go look for him. \n\nI went to one of the rental properties and the garage was opened, him and his friend were in the backyard. I ran into the garage and saw the sync module that connects all the cameras was unplugged hence why it was showing offline. I took the module with me and the bag of weed they had ready to smoke. \n\nHe texted me telling me I\u2019m so petty 10 minutes later so I spun around back so he can say it to my face. \n\nI went in the back and he was with his friend breaking down a shed, he walked towards me and said why are you so petty. I was surprised he said that in front of his friend but it was probably to maintain his reputation since I\u2019m assuming it was that guy who called him a simp. \n\nWe went to the front of the house and he kept asking me why I was here, what did I achieve coming here, give him back the module, out of all days I choose today to talk that I could have came to his workplace. I also asked him who called him a simp and he wouldn\u2019t say anything, he was biting his lip. I told him someone must have called him a simp in order for him to say what he said to me which was \u201cthat\u2019s why your dad is a simp to your mom, and if that\u2019s what your trying to do with me it\u2019s not going to work\u201d. \n\nWhenever we fight it\u2019s always me approaching him to resolve. For once I wanted to be chased. \n\nWe\u2019ve been together for 8 years and I think he trapped me financially so it would be hard for me to leave. How would you approach this when the other is not willing to sit down and talk/listen. ",

In my experience that is usually just a female interaction with showing too much or too little interest.  Maybe that's wrong of me to think but i have had a few girls leave because i was too available.\n\nI'm also more traditional I feel so I like to let people know that I'm interested in them by showing interest and doing things for them.  Which has won me some success with traditional ladies and lost me some newer generational thinking girls.  So as a guy if a girl shows me interest I will never lose interest because of that fact but because i realise something i dont like or agree with that breaks the idea of continuing as i date for a long term goal of finding \"the one\"\n\nAs stated before I'm more tradition but have no problem splitting Bill's for dates or receiving gifts however i dont expect it because my way of thinking is the guy has to provide and pay for things.  That's just how i was raised.  \n\nShow your interest and dont suppress it due to fear of the other losing interest.  If they lose interest it wasn't because of your availability, desire to pay your fair share, or gifts.",

He's just not into you. \n\n2) Love language isn't about how you show love, It's about how you recieve love, how you feel loved, how you understand that \"Wow, this person loves me\". Hence the name \"Lovelanguage\". Meaning, how you communicate to eachothers that you love and care for them. Let's say you have a friend/damily you deeply care about but their main language is Chinese and speak only very little to no English. You don't just communicate to them in English expecting them to understand you fully do you? No, you learn their language and they learn your language more so both can more easily communicate and understand eachothers.\n\nSo for your next relationship, if you want it to be healthy and succeed, you need to learn your partners love language (again, how they feel loved) and do that, whether it's physical touch, words of affirmations etc etc. And you also communicating what your love language is.",

A few years back, there was a girl (21F) at university who seemed very interested in me, but I was loyal to my then-girlfriend. After the breakup, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her, but I only knew her first name, making it hard to find her online.\n\nRecently, I stumbled upon her liking a post related to our university and decided to reach out. I explained my situation, and she initially seemed upset, asking why I waited 3 years to contact her. However, she quickly reassured me that she wasn\u2019t mad and we\u2019ve been texting regularly since. She\u2019s funny and nice, but I\u2019m confused about her feelings. \n\nI feel like she\u2019s surprised by my message and doesn\u2019t seem to show much attraction through texts. However, she continues to engage with me. If she wasn\u2019t interested in me she would just stop texting me all together but she keeps texting me and sending voice messages and pictures or videos of herself showing me what she is doing and stuff so im a bit confused. I'm wondering when I should consider planning a date or flirting more openly. She lives a bit far, but I could drive to a midpoint. What are your thoughts on this situation?\n\n**TL;DR:** I (22M) recently got out of a 3-year relationship and reached out to a girl (21F) from university who showed interest in me years ago. She was initially surprised and slightly upset but reassured me she wasn\u2019t mad. We\u2019ve been texting regularly, but I\u2019m unsure about her feelings and when to plan a date or flirt more openly, especially since she lives far away. Any advice?",

I do know that on my first dates women would tell me, i thought you were gay because i made myself visible to you and you just ignored me. I had no idea what in the world they meant by that, so i started asking, befriended female friends in college and learned a lot that way. \n\nIf you don't know how to read the language of women, befriend women and observe them. Talk to them and listen how they complain about what guys don't do, or women will tell you, i did this and that and the guy didn't pay attention.\n\nIf you cannot do that, the other thing to do is learn not to give a fuck!!! If you have some clue that a woman likes you, just go up and talk to her. The more you do this the more you'll learn. Your question is like saying, i don't know how to make money, I see people making money, and it seems some have a job, some start a business, but i don't know how to do any of that, but i want to make money.

Instead of worrying about subtly cues, do what you would consider clear. Ask girls out (but preferably not at work, imo), go out yourself, even speak to girls about how to understand those cues.

        "text": "so there's a bit of backstory with this guy i matched with him on hinge august 2024 he was so sweet and cute but i had just gotten broken up with in july 2024 by a guy I was dating for a month who I knew since elementary but he wasnt ready etc. I thought I was ready so I talked to this guy but when it came time to plan the date and go out I realized I'm not ready so I ended things with him I wished him well and blocked him. He's also 11 years older than me I was 23(f) he was 33(m) at the time now we're both 24 and 34. Around November I reached out and apologized for blowing him off and he was friendly towards me and every once in a while he would check in. Up until now this whole time I've been keeping to myself, working, minding my own business. He reached out last week to check in and asked me on a low pressure date and I agreed to the date (first one I've been on since July) I meet him in person he's very sweet and charming I liked him so far. We got coffee, walked to the library did some work, then got sushi before saying goodbye. He has his own business and during the date stepped away to make client calls so I kinda understood why it would take long for him to reply. After the date I did want to give him a goodbye kiss on the cheek but he didn't give me a chance to. He complimented my perfume and how I looked nice I tried to be nice too but I'm really shy. There were points where he would try to touch my arm, mimic my body language, or move closer to me. After the date I texted him and thanked him and tried to flirt and mention the goodbye kiss(a bit cringe now sorry-to test if he felt the same way) he said he sensed it but wanted to be my friend first since he was burned out from dating. I thanked him for his honesty and told him I liked him so far and I was okay taking things slow if it did become a relationship or something serious. I don't like short term or casual dating just my preference I told him that and that I saw potential if I didn't I wouldn't waste his time. I also said if he didn't agree to just let me know so he wouldn't waste my time either. He said he liked my idea and wanted to go extremely slow and a genuine friendship first no pressure. I did later say that I would want to schedule low pressure dates every few weeks and talk a bit more to get to know each other more instead of a monthly check in but not 24/7 and he responded \"That makes a lot of sense, and I think it can get there and we gradually see\" Now I'm a bit torn, in previous relationships things have progressed quickly for me and the guys give me reassurance that they like me but in the end those relationships have failed and maybe I'm not used to this. I've just been screwed over a bit in the past by guys and just overall I'm an anxious person. I'm just a bit worried that maybe I might just be an option he's keeping if he's just stringing me along or if he'll actually try albeit slowly. I just don't know anymore if older guys genuinely want to take things slow and if he's sincere in building a friendship first before a relationship. We're also part of the same culture so guys his age are usually married and ideally I would want to be with someone 2-4 years before getting proposed to/married so I wouldn't want to waste my time. I feel like I'm overthinking things, I've talked to/dated various ranges of people and some of the guys closer to my age are not ready mentally or lead me on. I'm a bit scared to get my heart broken again because it took a while to recover last time and I've learned to be okay with my own company so I don't want to revert backwards. Are guys his age usually more genuine with building a foundation of friendship before? How long should I give him if he wants to go extremely slow? Maybe he didn't like me enough to date and is saying he wants to go slow or something? thank you if you read this far :')",

        "text": "I (28M) met a woman (28F) on Twitter and we started DMing. Lots in common, great personality, and I\u2019m into her. Prior to that, she tweeted about wishing someone would care about even the small details of her life, so I messaged that I\u2019d love to get to know her. She replied twice, then went quiet.\n\nLast Thursday, I said \u201cno pressure, I get that people can be in different headspaces, but I like you and would love to keep talking if you\u2019re interested.\u201d She responded that I\u2019m sweet and that she\u2019s been in a funk and bad at checking messages, but did ask me a few questions and seemed genuinely interested. Since then, though, she\u2019s sometimes very slow to reply (she works full-time, which I understand) but she\u2019s active on Twitter all the while.\n\nI gave her my number last night and said she could text me if she wanted. She texted almost immediately so I could save her contact. This morning I said these \u201cgood morning, hope you have a good day\u201d (she does these \u201cgood morning\u201d posts on Twitter and I thought it\u2019d be a cute way to connect). She finally replied four hours later still tweeting during that gap.\n\nI 100% understand I\u2019m not obligated to her time, but I figure if she felt the same way, she\u2019d respond. Am I overthinking this? Is it too soon to know if she\u2019s into me? Feels a little one-sided. Should I straight-up ask if she likes me back, or wait it out? I\u2019m confused. Any advice?",

I know I need to work on it, but its difficult.\n\nI have been talking to this really nice guy, he asked spontaneously if I was up for a drink I first said ok, but then I saw my face and my face looks bumpy and I have this huge pimple come up on middle of my forehead \ud83d\ude11. So i ended up saying No. I know I didn't do the best thing, and probably made him feel bad.\n\nI don't use a lot of makeup either and I wanted to be my best self, usually if its eczema I become irritated also, bcs my skin is weird, itchy, warm, painful etc. Not to forget the antihistamines.\n\nI explained to this guy about my condition and that its been a tough week.and I apologised also.\nHe asked me I am from a warmer country so how did I get sun allergy, it didn't make any sense to him. Then also why am I on dating apps, if I don't want to meet. I understand he was upset, but how does a person cope up with these issues. I find it difficult to manage.\n\nDoes anybody has a similar experience with skin related or health issues? Any suggestions?",

One of the crew  guys whom I thought was handsome and super friendly with me,  perhaps borderline flirting?  was from Pennsylvania.\n I overheard his conversation with another guy, stating he is single and I also thought his southernish accent added to his charm.\n\n On the last day, he was the only one working in my home so we discussed some of my future minor home projects I had in mind. I asked if he wanted to do those. He replied \"I can do it, do you want to write down my number?\" ( I hid my excitement when he offered his number..which I am very good at btw..)\n\nI didn't have my phone with me so I nonchalantly replied \"You can just leave it there.\" He said \"Ok.\" And walked back to the room he was finishing up. I went outside..\n\nA couple of hrs later, he gathers his tools to leave, I meet him at the doorway before he walks out and thank him for the job he did.\n\nAfter he left, I then look around, expecting to see his phone # written on a piece of paper. But there was nothing. Haha\n\nTo be honest, I was kinda bummed out, mostly because I wanted to see him again. This was weeks ago and still think about it every now and then. I may never see this person again.\n\nDid I miss my chance for this to happen, Did I unintentionally sabotage it? Or was he just not interested? Perhaps he was only being friendly because duh, its his job...\n\nMy friend thinks he might have misunderstood that \"leave it there\" part, which I meant literally.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I need closure for this, so I can take your honest opinion and just move on with my life. \ud83d\ude04 If it was all in my head, I need to hear that too.\n\n\n",

But I recently lost a lot of weight and upgraded my wardrobe. The problem is, idk what to do! \n\nI've always been told to just smile, but even now as an adult struggle to even make eye contact for more than 1 second, like even when I catch someone looking/staring at me, I'm still the first to look away after a half second out of anxiety. \n\nFor context, the last time this happened was at a fast food restaurant setting, I caught her looking 4 times in 3 different areas in the restaurant. She was with a friend gossiping, but because of my lack of emotional intelligence, I just smiled at the end (as I already finished eating) and went about my day. I wasn't sure if it would've been socially acceptable to walk up to her and her friend given the setting, and even if it was, I wouldn't know what to say without sounding like a pick up artist.  So I played it safe. \n\nAny insights or advice? My fear isn't rejection, my fear is making someone feel uncomfortable because I misread the situation or tried chatting someone up at a place not suitable for that. Did I do the right thing by playing it safe? Or are there things I can do/learn to do in those situations without being too aggressive? ",

I downloaded tinder some weeks ago just to see what happens, i didn't want to lead anyone on, I know I'm not ready for a relationship at all, I just wanted to talk to people. I've matched with a lot of people but never really connected with anyone lol but like 3 days ago i matched with a really nice guy, we've been talking and I really enjoy his company, last night we really talked about what were our goals, he wants a long term relationship and I told him that right now I'm not ready for a relationship, and that i mostly wanted someone who i could talk to and maybe go out with and he was fine with it! He said we could keep talking and maybe get to know each other better. I warned him again to take what i said seriously, and that I don't want to hurt him. \n\nI blocked my ex some time ago to try to move on without getting \"hope\" he could text me again, and I've been getting better! I still think about him everyday which sucks but that's grieving i guess. The thing is that most nights I dream of him, that we get back together, become friends but he realizes that he misses me or simply knowing he wants to talk again. I wake up feeling fuzzy and wanting to unblock him until I realize it was all a dream\ud83d\udc80 well, yesterday I had another one of those dreams, I felt happy when I woke up but started feeling guilty almost immediately, I have this really nice guy who seems to genuinely be interested in me but I'm still dreaming about my ex and it's driving me crazy fr \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I don't want to hurt him at all, he wants a relationship but I'm not 100% over my ex but at the same time I warned him I'm not ready for a relationship and he accepted it but I'm so confused I don't know if what I'm doing is wrong or what and I hope someone can give me some advice about what to do next or what mindset I should have. \n\nSorry for the long rant and sorry if in any moment I didn't make sense, english is my second language.",

So give it time, build new experiences and you'll be able to move on in your own time. Dating can force you to move on but you seem well aware that rebounding is not always the best course of action. There's a lot of great guys out there and if you don't feel ready at this moment to move on then it's ok to wait. \n\nI think the important points are:\n\n1. Communication with the guy, \n\n2.

Between the ages of 16 and 21, I was in three long-term relationships and had always met people in the usual ways, through university, mutual friends, that kind of thing.\n\nSince my last relationship ended (which was a bit rough), I haven\u2019t really been able to meet anyone. It\u2019s not the end of the world, but I feel like I get zero attention from women. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m unattractive. I\u2019ve got some decent features, I\u2019m tall, and I\u2019m in shape again after gaining a bit of weight post-breakup. I\u2019m not in a bad place in life either. I\u2019m doing a PhD, I\u2019m well-read, well-travelled, and I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a decent person.\n\nBut I\u2019m just not meeting people. My field is very male dominated, and since I moved to a new city for the PhD, the only people I really know are on my course. They\u2019re great, but mostly introverted, and I\u2019ve lost that old friend network where you\u2019d meet people more naturally. My friends from home are all in relationships, and I don\u2019t have many women in my social circles these days.\n\nI\u2019d love to branch out and meet new people, but between the PhD and everything else, I don\u2019t have loads of time for new hobbies. To be honest, I\u2019m not even sure where to find beginner-friendly stuff I\u2019d actually enjoy.\n\nI\u2019ve been kind of just waiting to see if something happens. I\u2019ve tried dating apps, and while I get some matches, the conversations tend to fizzle out. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m terrible at small talk, but maybe I'm just not great at keeping the momentum going.\n\nI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s tough. I know I should be doing something differently, but I genuinely don\u2019t know what. Just wanted to get it off my chest and maybe hear from anyone who\u2019s been in a similar spot",

        "text": "So i have been with my parter for just over 6 months now.  But i am not really sure if i should stay in this relationship. I love them a huge amount and this is the most loving relationship i have ever been. However initially when we first met i had some hesitation on my attraction to them, as we connected more this physical attraction grew. But a few weeks ago, they did a bizarre test on me to ascertain how willing i would be to give them money. This was money they needed for a time sensitive issue and it was not a massive amount but not small either. But everything now feels incredibly cloudy, i feel disrespected and my attraction to them is now deeply affected. I deeply hate being tested. It was like my reaction was being watched to sense how \u2018good\u2019 of a partner I was. That made me feel judged, not trusted. I am not sure how to get past this. They are also a bit of an insecure person and i worry their insecurities will impact our relationship.They have apologised profuzelu and deeply regret it, but i still feel the same. I am not sure if i need to give this more or if i really need to end things. Can i become more attracted after this? i really dont know . ",

        "post-author": "Expensive-Mammoth678",
        "text": "This is quite a long story. \n\nI have been abroad for my Erasmus and he has been my flatmate for months. I swear he has been one of the nicest people I have ever met. He has always been helpful, he liked having conversations in the kitchen, supported me with the language barrier, etc. \n\nThe first day I got in the apartment he said we had to toast for this new beginning , and he asked me if I liked beer. As I said I preferred wine, he literally went outside just to buy me a bottle so that each of us could toast with what we liked most.\n\nSo, this is his vibe: he is super nice, and calm and friendly. Even more than what I would call the standard. During my months in that apartment nothing ever happened, not even flirting. But we were also dating other people. So it made sense. \n\nOver the spring I moved out. However, i had to come back during the summer for an internship and he hosted me. I just remember that I started crushing on him back then. Because he would come back late at night, while i was still working on my pc and for 2 or 3 nights we had like 2 hours long conversations until 2 am.\n\nOne year passed by, we weren\u2019t connecting much, just some messaging from time to time. This spring I had to go back for my thesis. It was just a week, and I got me an Airbnb, but I really wanted to see him and I invited him out for a coffee, but he asked me to go out for a drink instead. Somehow a drink gives me a more flirty vibe, but I might be wrong. \n\nHowever nothing happened, again, we sat in a bar and had amazing conversations for 5 hours straight. But there was just some hands touching with excuses like \u201ci like your rings\u201d, etc. Only once, he was saying he tried something nice. I said: you know what it tastes nice?  And he replied \u201cyou?\u201d \n\nIdk why but I did not reply fast enough and i just let the moment go. And it seemed like nothing happened. However he told me that he had some conferences in a city nearby my hometown the following week and that we could spend the weekend together. \n\nI thought: ok, he is clearly flirting. We spent two days together. Totally vibing. Sleeping in the same bed. But he never flirted explicitly with me. However he was dedicating to me all his attention, he rarely looked at his phone. We did not have quiet moments where you come back home and you just mind your business. He was constantly engaging in conversations with me. He was super nice. \n\nBut he also slept in the same bed with me with just his boxers on and he came out half naked from the shower, while he could have just get dressed in the bathroom. And he spent all the time saying things like \u201cwe can do this the next time we will be together\u201d. I am confusedd. \n\nWhen the weekend finished he hugged me and kissed me two or three times on the cheeks. And said that if I had to go back to his city, he would have hosted me again. \n\nIn two weeks I have to go there again, and he is hosting me. We have been chatting here and there, he has been writing me quite a few times. \n\nI just cannot understand if he is super nice or if he fancies me somehow. If you read until here: what do you think?",

He is very active on Instagram, posted like 13 stories today. But he only watched one of mine and none of the rest. he is very good friends with one of my guy friends and this guy told me he said he liked me very much but he wasn't looking to date anyone right now, but that I was the best sex he's ever had and that we get along great. I'm also not looking to date so this doesn't bother me, but I've been thinking maybe he silenced my stories on Instagram because hes lost interest. At the same time I find this hard to believe because we talked yesterday and everything seemed fine, I even slept at his house the day before yesterday. So I don't understand why he would choose to not watch my stories anymore :(\n\nI feel like a silly teenager who overthinks everything and I can't believe I'm getting so in my head about insta stories, so any opinion is valid please and thank you",

                "body": "Hey friend :) You're not silly! It is very natural to think about how other people feel about us, especially when it is someone we're interested in. My initial instinct when reading this is that he's having a busy day. If he has posted multiple stories today, there's probably a lot happening around him that's holding his attention. If you'd like, tomorrow you could ask him how his day went - \"you posted a lot of insta stories, seems like it was a fun day!\" Of course, we can't ignore the possibility that he has lost interest, because in dating that is always a possibility. However, my thoughts are that 1) him not watching your stories is not, by itself, a sign that he has lost interest, and 2) even if he has or in the future does lose interest in you, it doesn't say anything about you and it doesn't mean you did anything wrong. Don't feel bad for thinking hard about this. If you can, try to call a friend, go for a walk, make yourself some tea, or do another activity you enjoy. Cheers!",

        "text": "Hello. So, I'll start this off by saying I'm a high schooler. And I really need help. I think I may be leading someone. For context, I have never had a crush or the intention to date someone. I suspect I'm aro. Recently, one of my friends I'll call her \"S\" tried to set me up with someone for prom, and oddly enough, I decided to agree. I got his number and texted him. We've been texting for a couple of weeks, and he's smart, funny, kind, and loves animals. Kinda perfect tbh. Well, when he texts, he flirts with me and compliments me. stuff like \"You're so pretty\" and \"I could stare into your eyes\" (that one was a bit weird but wtv). Well, I was talking to the same friend who set me up with him, and she said that he admitted he used to have a crush on her but didn't have feelings for her anymore (they are just friends). I trust her and believe that she wouldn't do anything like that. But that's beside the point. While I was texting her I told her I was kinda scared and unsure about him. I have never talked to a boy with the intent to date or really thought about it. She asked if I was leading him on and that if I was, I was a btch for doing that. This kinda surprised me cause it was a bit random. She then went on to say that some of my classmates are like that, and people don't like them for it. She probably said this because those people also got into an argument with her, and she is kinda in a dark place rn. I was shocked, and it made me think about my relationship with this boy. It also made me a bit upset because I didn't want to think about him. I want to focus on my grades and my finals, which are next week. In fact, every time I text him, I feel bad or weird because I'm not as smart as him and I'm scared my grades will drop, and I'm distracting myself from what matters. I just told her wtv I do, I'll do it after finals, cause that's my priority. But she texted me back to text him tomorrow about how I feel. If I don't like him, want him to take it slow, etc. I feel pressured and as if I am deceiving him. To me, we are still in the early talking stage, but it's clear he is falling for me (which is crazy, cause I never even thought anyone would ever like me like that). I don't want to ruin what we have, but I also don't see myself dating him or going to prom with him yet. I feel it's too early, but the more I think about it, the more I feel I'm doing him dirty, and he deserves so much better. Hes actually nice and I don't want to be some bop who ghosts him or just an asshole. I don't know what to do or what to say to either him or S. S is right, but she's very problematic and not the best...person. I think I should just tell him I want ot take things slow, but we've barely started talking and I don't want to push him away. Deep down, tho I don't think I \"like\" him yet, but it's too early to tell. I kinda regret agreeing to talk to him in the first place, cause I'm making my life harder. Even if I continue to talk to him, what would I even do, how would I even tell him that I want to slow down when nothing has even happened yet. My parents also don't know about him, and neither does my sister, only my school friends. And I am not trying to tell everyone and make my life harder. I feel I should just stop and try to be friends, cause clearly I'm not ready for anything. Please give me some advice. I'm probably just being dumb about this all.",

She started working at other locations after that and we didn\u2019t talk much beyond interacting on socials. At the beginning of this year, she came back to my location. We only saw each other a few times, but every time we did, she said she missed me. Then in February, she told me she was moving again, but couldn\u2019t say where, so I assumed she was leaving the company and that was that.\n\nLater, I found out she was actually opening a new location nearby. A couple days before the official opening, I sent a heartfelt message congratulating her. She replied that she missed me \u201cso much\u201d again. When I told her I planned to visit on opening day, she seemed genuinely excited and said \"I can't wait to see you.\u201d I sent another message the morning of the opening, now a few days ago, and she said it meant \u201cthe world.\u201d\n\nAfter her shift ended that day, we met up. We hugged. During the hug, she was saying something, but I couldn\u2019t make anything out. Then she pulled back, cupped my face, and said something else. In that moment I basically blacked out and have no idea what she said there either. We hung out for around 30\u201345 minutes (not alone, there were three other people around, including a close coworker/friend of mine), and said our goodbyes. We briefly texted the next morning, and that\u2019s been it so far. I told her I am planning to visit again in a few days, and she seemed excited by that too.\n\nI\u2019ve talked to my friend who was there, and explained everything to them. Even they weren\u2019t sure what to make of the interaction.\n\nSo, please help. I know this means something. I really like this woman, and I\u2019d love for it to go somewhere. If I knew what she said during the hug, it'd probably help, but without it I'm just kinda lost. What should I do next?\n\nThanks in advance.",

The other night, around 2 AM, we were chatting on our work chat, and I mentioned that I\u2019d like to go to the same gym as him. He didn\u2019t reply, which made me think he might not be interested.\n\nBut then, when I went on my break and came back, he saw me and waved! I checked the chat again, and he still hadn\u2019t responded, which left me feeling confused. Since then, he seems to be acting differently\u2014he walks by my area more often and makes eye contact, and I can\u2019t help but wonder if he\u2019s feeling awkward around me!\n\nI asked him if he needed help with anything, and he said no, but then a minute later, he came back to ask the same question I initially posed. It\u2019s like he\u2019s unsure how to interact with me! When he did something well at work, I complimented him, and he even repeated my words three times, which I found a bit strange.\n\nAt the end of the shift, I sent him a message to apologize in case my earlier message made him feel uncomfortable. He replied, \"Oh no, you're okay. I've just been busy.\" After that, he came over, playfully punched my arm, and thanked me for everything.\n\nNow I\u2019m left wondering if there\u2019s a chance he might be interested in me too. I really like him, but since we work together, I don\u2019t want to make him feel uncomfortable.\n\nAny tips on how to navigate this situation? How should I approach him moving forward? Thanks in advance! \ud83d\udc95",

It makes me want to give up altogether.\n\nJust for context, I have never dated seriously before or been in a relationship. I feel like by being so intense and scaring men off I keep reinforcing the idea that I am fundamentally unloveable, which of course is not easy to accept.\n\nI feel like I have this deep need to love and be loved which I cannot ignore anymore and I don't know what to do with myself.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.",

        "post-author": "jacobmo",
        "text": "So last July I got a new roommate. I immediately though she was very cute but didn't think much else of it.  \nOver the next month we hung out a decent bit around the house and I started developing a pretty serious crush on her.  Around October we've become pretty good friends and it's turned into the biggest crush of my life. I'm crazy about her, she's pretty much the girl of my dreams.\n\nOne big issue, she's been in a relationship this whole time. Anyways, Around October time we have quite a few moments that make me think, 'she might like me back.' but with her being in a relationship I try to put it in the back of my mind. Right around the start of November she disappeared. For months I wondered what I did. Well in March I think, another roommate got too drunk and let it slip that around November she told her that she has a crush on me. So I think she stopped talking to me so she could push her feelings for me down.\n\nCome March time her boyfriend breaks up with her. She's absolutely crushed. We slowly start talking again. I try to be a supportive friend, taking her out to do things to cheer her up, take her mind of things, get a break from her 70 hour work weeks, etc.. Our bond really starts growing again. While drinking we have a few more moments, some decent bit of flirting at times, but while sober she keeps things pretty platonic.\n\nEarly may comes and she's still struggling. One night I catch her as she's leaving, and she invites me to come along with her to a work happy hour. We go out for a few hours, I'm a little tipsy and she's decently drunk. We eventually get home and she decides she wants to walk around. We spend the next 30 minutes walking one way and decide to head home since it's about 12:30am at this point and she works at 7am.  On the way home things get very flirty.  \nAt one point she lays down in the grass pulling me down with her. We lock eyes and she spends a while stroking my arm. At another time she needed a break so we sit down and she rested her head in my hand. Moving on I carry her a few times. Then comes the sad part of being drunk - she starts calling hating on herself, calling herself ugly and such. I break and confess how beautiful I think she is, I tell her she's the cutest women I've ever met, which is true. We continue the walk home, and she randomly stops and then gives me the best hug I've ever had. It's been a few weeks and I still think back to it every 30 minutes.  \nWe finally get home, and she wants to watch a movie. We sit on the couch and she dives over and starts cuddling me. We spend the next two hours with her in my arms, me playing with her hair until she eventually falls asleep. Her being drunk, I didn't take any of her dozen openings to kiss and do more.\n\nA few days later we go grab a coffee. Just before getting home I talk to her about the night. She says she's fine with everything that happened. I ask her if it meant anything to her and she tells me she's not sure, she's still struggling with the breakup and is confused. She brings up concerns of us dating while roommates, and ask me several questions about what I'd be looking for.\n\nA week later I ask how she's doing with everything and she tells me she needs space but don't take it personally. I stopped texting her and when running into her I kept things to hellos and short small talk. Thursday after running into her a few times and getting in my feels I finally caved and texted her asking how she's doing and asking if she still needs space. I have not gotten a response yet.\n\nToday my landlord let me know that she'll be moving next month. I'm really worried that if we don't work things out I'll never get to see or talk to her again after moving.  \nThat night made it clear she has feelings for me again, there was a lot of passion, it wasn't just a drunk girl needing comfort. although they're hidden under a lot of sadness, maybe some confusion and a fear of being hurt again.\n\nI just don't really know what to do at this point. Do I try to reach out again at some point? Do I just let it go and see if she ever reaches out. Did she lie about being okay with what happened?",

You're having effortless conversations with each other and maintaining eye contact, sharing great laughs, and her wanting to keep in touch with you, is a great sign. Seems to me like you two are very compatible with each other and that she'd be very receptive to a second date with you. My suggestion to you is to message her to see if she's interested in a second date.\n\nWhat's the worst that could happen? She says no. There's plenty of fish in the sea, and if it's not meant to be, then it's not meant to be. But you won't know unless you shoot your shot. Like the great Wayne Gretzky once said \"100% of the shots you don't take don't go in\".\n\nSo to reiterate, message her to gauge her level of interest in a second date. Depending on the response she gives you, you'll know if she's receptive and open to a second date. If she sounds emotionally engaged to your message, then that's a good sign. Ask her out for a second date. However, if you receive a lukewarm response from her, then it's time to abort mission, and seek greener pastures elsewhere. Don't put all your eggs into one basket and don't put her on a pedestal.\n\nThe ball is in your court. Your move.",

        "text": "In my context I'm specifically asking about men.\n\nI've been seeing a man for a month now (we aren't exclusive, but neither of us are actively pursuing others), and in person, we have really amazing dates. We have good conversations, make eachother laugh, and we can't keep our hands off each other. We have great sex and great conversations. There's a lot more that I don't think is necessary to fit in here but I honestly feel very respected and I appreciate his behavior towards me. He's also pretty open when we talk, and we can have anywhere from silly to feel conversations pretty easily. He's easy to talk with.\n\nHowever I'm used to specific patterns from men I've been with in the past; they aaaaalways want to text and talk, a lot. This guy isn't a frequent texter and while I'm trying not to take it personally, it does unfortunately make me nervous since I'm used to more consistent and frequent communication. Patterns with my past partners are just not matching up.\n\n We seem to take turns sending good morning texts and most of our nights have been ending with a quick phone or video call. I admit I am holding back A LOT, since when I'm into someone, I want to hear from them all the time but I understand this can be overwhelming to many.\n\nI don't want to add any stress to his life nor do I want to come off as too aggressive by expressing my desire for a looot more texting, but I can't lie, and say it doesnt bother me because it does. \n\nAs of right now we're dating casually and he did ask me on our last date if I'd be open to a relationship in the future if he asked, and I said yes (I'm a slow burner, it takes me a couple months for strong feelings to appear, but I do like him right now). I am interested in him but the lack of texting/taking a bit to get back is a larger turn-off for me than I thought. There were two other men in my DMs that are lightning quick to respond, and so it makes me wonder if this man actually likes me or not. \n\nIt's only been a month of dating, so I'm not even sure if it's worth bringing this up now. I'm also questioning whether it's even a big deal at all or not, since everything else is so good, and I'm not sure if I need to work on getting over it/not taking it personally. I don't know.\n\nThe thing is, I can't even think of a reasonable way for him to \"fix' it that wouldn't change who he already is (I don't like asking that of people), is just \"text me more/respond right away even if it's just for a 20 minute window! I hate having to wait 20 min in between each text!\"\n\n",

I take days to respond to men I'm genuinely not interested in. \n\nIt sucks to say it, but I would personally have a major issue with that. You can address it, even casually - maybe over your next in-person date? I find a lot of \"serious\" topics can be confused via text especially this early on. You can try to play it cool and casually mention it.\n\nAt that point though, I personally would have lost a lot of interest in someone not getting back to me for daaaays.\n\nNow I feel greedy being irked over a couple hours \ud83d\ude2d",

But, I feel like it\u2019s a really tedious and almost humiliating process. \n\nPlease could someone shed some perspective why the perception exists?\n\nEdit:\n\nThread analysis:\n1. The idea that the man should make the first move is totally accepted as the norm among both men and women\n\n2. The best framing of how to accept making the first move is that you get to pick who you date as opposed to letting fate decide. Agency is empowering\n\n\nThank you for all the comments. It\u2019s been really useful in helping me understand the dating dynamic and how to move forward.",

Hence why I asked for clarification that he found the women whom were approaching him were of a certain caliber/quality. I think thats a totally valid question. I want to understand if high quality women will do this too. Or if they are so used to having men approach that they simply don't make the effort or take the risk.

If you're conventionally good looking, have an active lifestyle and take good care of yourself, women will signal their interest but it's up to you to pick up on it and do something.\n\nThat alone won't guarantee that you'll be flocked by Instagram and Playboy models.

Either person can initiate THE PROPOSAL of sex or relationship but let's be honest, women want a powerful resourceful man to take care of them and guys want a woman who's going to satisfy their sexual needs (because most other needs a man has he can get on his own or from a non-romantic relationship). That being said, the man initiating is just a part of the role of Man.  Especially in today's world women are doing more than they've been allowed to do in the past but they are mostly still living a double standard as they don't want to initiate, they don't want to provide financially And they don't want to think critically. I'm not saying something stupid like \"the man wears the pants\" or something that's just plain propaganda like \"happy wife, happy life\" BUT I am saying there is a dynamic between men and women that has worked for all of human history and you shouldn't let the modern times persuade you too much. One last thing, Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, being a man is an amazing thing because you have the appointed power of physical and intellectual competency And all you need to do is harness your spirit to shape your world.\nP.S. In my personal experience I've been approached by women a few times. Only one of them was ever to my liking even though I gave all of them a chance. Don't give away your power fella",

If they never went to school and studied at higher academic levels then I\u2019d never find someone curious enough to talk about my ideas with. If they never worked then I\u2019d never find someone who could understand the problems I\u2019d face at work. \n\nThe whole purpose of marriage is to split the burden of life via multiple income sources and another mind to help solve problems",

However, I do not believe I said explicitly that women are incompetent and if I did I apologize. What I meant was that women tend to be intelligent in less numbers than men (just my experience but I did come across a study that backs this up some time ago and I can find it if you like) And also the type of intelligence women have tends to be superficial such as mathematics or biology but they tend to lack in fields such as philosophy or politics and most people in general are disinterested with history even though it's one of the most important subjects anyone can study. There is also a discrepancy between how men and women tend to view marriage and I think these views are mostly justified when you think of the risk involved, A woman can get out of marriage with almost no cost But a man... Very different. Personally, I think marriage is more than just resource management. I believe it's just as much an emotional contract as it is financial but most people tend to toss the emotional aspect to the wayside if their wife is a bad communicator or their husband isn't making money enough to satisfy them.\n\nOnce again, I would like to reiterate that I genuinely appreciate your grace and I mean you no disrespect. Some women are not worth asking out and you probably wouldn't be able to pick up on it if you give up your power as a man to decide whether or not you want to further things. I don't know your financial or status situation but if I assume you're an average Joe many if not most women wouldn't ask out guys like you or me if they had the courage to do so.",

As far as I know marriage from a financial stand is a far more beneficial if the couple stay together but after divorce both parties are financially devastated. It\u2019s difficult to get away from lawyer/ court fees regardless of gender",

The same with men in education. I would agree with you that men and women are more or less equal if given the same foundations but as the old saying goes you can lead a horse to water but cannot compel it to drink. All the women that I've known intimately who work in education SEEM like dumb bitches (no offense intended to any women who are in education this is NOT a blanket statement). Admittedly, none of them have done education higher than 5th grade So maybe this data pool is skewed but from my time in school the women have been vastly less committed and more prejudice than their male colleagues especially to the boys and to the girls who get lots of attention from said boys. I did receive an American education (inner-city) so I don't know if that makes me privileged or hindered.\n\nI cannot speak at length about marriage and divorce proceedings. I only know what I am told and what I have seen and I have not seen too many men get out of marriage without being destitute. I'm inclined to believe that if a woman is coming out of marriage destitute from lawyers fees she was not contributing a whole lot financially because that's typically how it goes. Two sources of income does not mean that you're both putting in the same amount. ALSO, The American sociological association reports that women are 69% more likely to file for divorce than men So for whatever reason women seem okay with going into debt to get out of a relationship and only by the statistics of this report can I assume they are less likely to  try to work things out. \n\nI do have a lot of frustration towards women so I apologize if my response comes off as abrasive but so long as the dialogue is open I'm going to explore the insights from those who have something to say.",

It's tedious and humiliating if you don't decide you don't care about the people who'd make you feel bad about trying. That may be onlookers who see you approach someone, people who make mean jokes & comments if you tell them what happened, and some women who look down on you for trying. These people don't matter. Growing up is realizing that, accepting it, and learning how to not let them get to you.  \n  \nThe tediousness can also be aleviated by being more intentional with who you approach. If you're desperately approaching anyone & everyone at random, or even just waiting to see signs of interest from random women (anyone who'll have you), that's the **wrong way** to do it.   \n  \nLook around and determine who you're interested in; you can wait for signs of interest (it only takes seconds for someone to smile at you), you can chat with people if you feel like it. But I can guarantee you're frustrated because you approach them with the single-minded desire to \"get\" a gf. You don't approach people to engage for a minute in some friendly small talk and just enjoy the company of a stranger.   \n  \nI get that's hard to do these days, but it isn't impossible.",

That\u2019s just biology.\n\nSex is riskier for women. They have a higher STD risk and of course there\u2019s also pregnancy as well. Two potentially life changing factors that mean women need to be much more selective about who they partner with.\n\nFrom a women\u2019s perspective, how do you know if a man is a good potential partner? How do you know he\u2019s ambitious, social intelligent, confident, motivated? \n\nWell, what you do is you give him a signal of interest and wait to see if he approaches. And if he does, you can give him a preliminary tick - at least he\u2019s bold and he knows what he wants.\n\nLife, virtually everything we\u2019ve created is like a big test for men to prove they\u2019re a good potential partner. It\u2019s deep inside our programming.\n\nYou can see this across all forms of animal where sex is part of procreation. Why does a peacock have huge dumb tail that makes him easier hunt and eat? Because it\u2019s a sign of genetic superiority and health.\n\nWhy are male celebrity so attractive to women? They have social status, success, they\u2019re typically physically attractive etc. All signs the say \u201cI\u2019d make great kids\u201d.\n\nAnd although there are cultural messages that promote changes in equality between men and women, the deep programming still exists.\n\nMen still don\u2019t care about women\u2019s career success and women still find it more attractive if their partner is more successful than them.\n\nPretty much everything that men do that is defined as \u201csuccess\u201d is showing women they\u2019d be good to have kids with.\n\nOtherwise, why would we seek achievement, power, physical strength, status etc. why bother? All of these things expend energy. Why wouldn\u2019t we just lie on the couch?\n\nBecause our physiology is designed to make us want to do things the signal our partner value. Why? Because if we don\u2019t, people stop having kids and there\u2019s no more human race.\n\nSo anyway, you must approach. That\u2019s your job. That\u2019s how you let women know you\u2019re a psychologically healthy and socially confident man. Just do it.",

You didn\u2019t get out of bed and say \u201ctoday and for the rest of my life, I\u2019m going to be intrinsically curious\u201d. Neither of those things were choices.\n\nThose are survival mechanism that are powered by your reward systems. You have hormones in your body that give an experience of pleasure and satisfaction when you don\u2019t certain things. Those things are typically aligned with survival.\n\nWhat is a wealthy and successful man other than a man whose survival mechanism programming led him to success?\n\nAnd why is it that women like men who are successful? Why not just like any guy? What\u2019s great about successful guys?\n\nThey\u2019re good at surviving. That\u2019s attractive.\n\nSee, if you go down deep enough, we are stimulus and response machines, playing out an ancient program to survive and find meaning in a meaningless universe.\n\nEverything you do is like the unwinding of a tiny spring or the spin of a small cog that adds to the giant machine of \u201clife must continue to exist on this planet\u201d. That\u2019s your game. That\u2019s everyone\u2019s game.

Pretty simple.\n\nThat\u2019s why men must approach. Because being able to approach a woman indicates you\u2019re mentally healthy, have a positive perception of yourself and go after what you want.

Especially if you are attractive.\n\nIt's kinda similar to how women will encourage men to cry and vent to them, but men will tell you to err on the side of caution because it can change a woman's perception of you if she becomes your shoulder to lean on during hard times.\n\nSo ofc we don't want it to be that way, but unfortunately gender roles does still have an affect on things imo.",

I only want men around me who I know I\u2019m safe with even when they aren\u2019t happy with me, do you understand that? That\u2019s what most women want and unfortunately most men do not make them feel safe enough to be able to \u201cstick it out\u201d with them, yanno? I\u2019m really tryna explain it if you\u2019re here for genuine advice, this programming goes so deep so it\u2019s hard to not treat it as seriously as i feel about it. That\u2019s the thing, women don\u2019t often experience partnership with men the way men experience partnership from women: you are probably correct to expect your partner: \n\u2022helps you \n\u2022enables you to pursue your goals (by cleaning up after you, making excuses for you, scheduling appts, for you, does paperwork for your company for you, cooks your meals, takes care of your children etc)\n\u2022provides intellectual and emotional support (whatever tf intellectual support is lmao, never heard of that but go off)\n\u2022you can trust and rely upon them indefinitely \nBut women can almost never expect the same from men. They can expect weirdness and miscommunications and humiliations and deviations and avoidances and discrepancies and thoughtlessness and to be overworked and used for their emotional labour and bodies. From experience, 98% of my interactions and relationships with men, were not fun for me. That\u2019s why women are harder to get than ever and the fact that men want to be the prize is so gross honestly, considering all of this. \nMy role is to be valued, so that I can continue to do what I\u2019m here to do. No building with men. Men follow me because I\u2019m a leader and empower me because they believe in who I am. I don\u2019t chase them, and they respect it.",

And when I match with someone, I work just to get those vibes and learn some basics. \n\nBut it's very difficult and drawn out when someone goes silent... for *days*. I don't want to be stuck in the talking stage forever. You know?\n\nSo an example i currently have is I'm talking with someone. He's starting to get into date type topics like... what is your ideal date, things like that. Stuff that comes usually before someone asks to meet. But during this conversation he vanishes for *days*.\n\nIt was a few messages a day at the start. To now 2 day gaps between responses.\n\nAnd I just feel like... is this even worth continuing? He's very sweet and we have stuff in common! But like... a different match would be giving more interactions or at the least giving a little heads up or apology.\n\nBut I don't know if I'm judging a stranger I've never met too harshly, and holding to too high expectations (wanting 1 - 2 messages minimum a day).\n\nOr\n\nIf this is just normal online dating behaviour. Totally normal to go days without responding, etc.\n\n\n",

My ex shows up at my mom\u2019s restaurant, stays over at her house. He and my mom also message eachother sometimes. We ended on semi bad weird terms (tldr I moved away for university and things got tense after I left and we broke up) and are no contact. He is literally having lunch with my family right this moment and I know this because they sent a group selfie in the family gc.. This man has infiltrated my life. When I went home during Christmas I found passport pictures of him stuck everywhere in my room in random places as well as our initials like this (YxN) drawn in different locations after he had slept over without me being there. I dont know what to do at this point. My mom isn\u2019t taking me seriously either when I bring it up to her, she\u2019s telling me to just \u201clet him ride the high\u201d wtf is that supposed to even mean? Please someone tell me I\u2019m not crazy and maybe give me some advice on how to set boundaries with these people? ",

I've heard from a friend once (at mental hospital) that he dated a 30 year old girl. I want someone who has more emotional experience and actually find value in me. An actual woman would be so much fun to talk to and maybe she would be able to help me mentally. I want to give someone something and have my own reason to live!

They\u2019re predators.\n\nI went through your profile as I thought this might be a bit I didn\u2019t understand the context of (similar to the Seinfeld one I saw yesterday) and I saw that you said in a different post you\u2019re autistic, so I\u2019m gonna try and lay this out bluntly because I know that\u2019s typically easier for people on the spectrum.\n\nNow I am not trying to talk down to you, but you are 16 so I\u2019m trying to thread the line of treating you like an adult while also conveying my experiences to you. You feel more mature but you aren\u2019t. Not having the same emotional reactions or wants as someone who isn\u2019t autistic doesn\u2019t make you more mature. Feeling like the people your age aren\u2019t as mature as you, or that you\u2019re smarter and more aware than them is often a sign of immaturity more than a sign of growth.\n\nAlso, I wouldn\u2019t trust what someone you met in a mental hospital told you. And even if they are honest, they\u2019re a victim, not an aspiration. The person they \u201cdated\u201d didn\u2019t make them more mature, it was abuse. If you\u2019re having a hard time coping with emotions and your own mental and emotional health, you are not in a place to be in a relationship.\n\nAnd, if you\u2019re looking for someone to date to give you a reason to live, and for your own mental well being, that\u2019s not a mature approach to a relationship, that\u2019s a selfish one. You don\u2019t date people for what they can do for you. You date people to find someone worth sharing yourself with.",

We really hit it off and planned a coffee date and all that, I found her pretty attractive as well.\n\nThe day before we were supposed to meet, she tells me that she is leaving for a university like 8 hours away, I asked her what she wanted in regards of us and she just said something casual... I asked her \"like a hookup?\" and she said yeah, we were rapidly texting so I kind of was like okay but \"i'm out of condoms so we're going to need to pick some up\" and she was totally down for it. She was 100% willing to pick me up from my parents house... pick up condoms with me at walmart... and have sex somewhere in her dad's pickup truck.\n\nAnyways, the day of, I just wrote out a paragraph saying that i'd like to save it for someone special instead of a one night stand type of thing and that I wish her best of luck in university, she ended up leaving me on read lol... like maybe I would of considered it if there was a chance of it being reoccurring but I feel like having sex once and then being voided of it would be senseless, it would only be an experience type of thing and no relationship, situationship or anything social would come out of it...\n\nNow i'm looking back on it a year later like... dang it is enticing but I think I made the right choice.\n\nHow would I get into dating seriously? I live in a sub 60k town and go to community college... summer ended and I have like no friendships lol since I recently moved here... anyone in my situation know what they would do? I feel like attending events alone is depressing so it's just a never ending cycle. Don't know if this belongs here but appreciate the help.",

You're not going to get the best advice from other virgins on Reddit (no offence) \n\nSo my perspective as a woman is 1) virginity is a construct and has no bearing on your ability to perform adequately or be an acceptable and decent partner and 2) don't tie your self worth to dating/rejection/ body counts etc etc. \n\nAll you have to do is act the same as you would as if you weren't a virgin. Nobody can tell. There's guys who have had sex before and are still bad at it. It's all about enthusiasm and listening. \n\nDating is going to be hard and holding onto this \"she has to be special\" might end up biting you in the behind. You can't expect the people you have sex with to always be special, or the first time to be a certain way. I don't blame you for not wanting a hookup as your first time in a random pick up truck though.",

I\u2019ve been attracted to her for awhile, so I was both surprised and pleased to be asked out. We\u2019re very much in the \u201clet\u2019s see where it goes but no pressure\u201d part of dating. \n\nUnfortunately I\u2019ve got a lot of relationship issues in the past feeling like I wasn\u2019t enough/wasn\u2019t good enough. Think poly against my wishes, and subtle negging. I\u2019m in therapy to work on it, and feeling better, but sometimes I still get stuck in my own head too much. I have an appointment next week but this is bugging me right now. \n\nWe\u2019ve both dated people of all genders, but I\u2019m more pan/fluid and she\u2019s joked she\u2019s like 90% straight. My insecurities are ramped up because I\u2019m quite femme, have very few masc tendencies and I\u2019m already bracing myself to not be good enough for her. I\u2019ve mentioned this and she\u2019s told me to not over think it - she wouldn\u2019t have asked me out if she wasn\u2019t genuinely interested. \n\nIntellectually I believe her. Emotionally my anxiety is up because I\u2019m finding myself in that weird fight/flight response from the past, despite her doing nothing to trigger it. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m accusing her of being like my exes, or even imply that she\u2019s done anything like they have.  She hasn\u2019t - it\u2019s all my own head. But I want to talk to her and at least be transparent about how I feel, and also that I am working on it and don\u2019t want it to affect her/our potential relationship. If anyone has any experience being on either side of this, what advice do you have? How did you approach it?",

I was surprised at the end when he said he had fun and wanted to hang out again. He texted me immediately after and we texted for 2 weeks with quick replies from him. He asked me out again and I feel like I had a better time on the first date. The energy was lacking from him this time and I asked lots of questions but conversation wasn\u2019t flowing very well at all. I am new to dating myself but I also feel he didn\u2019t give me much eye contact at all or ask me many questions about myself, leading me to think he didn\u2019t fancy me. I suggested going for a drink at the end but he said he was ready to go. Therefore, I was very surprised at the end when he kissed me and asked for a third date. He texted me as soon as I got home too. Am I missing something? Nothing on the actual date let me to believe he liked me or was having a good time. I don\u2019t recall him smiling once and I don\u2019t think we laughed much at all. Overall it wasn\u2019t bad but it wasn\u2019t great. I think I\u2019m just surprised but his actions but perhaps he isn\u2019t very good at expressing himself. Any advice? \n\nTLDR: Kissed on the second date but he didn\u2019t give any indication during the date that he liked me, minimal eye contact and flirting but asked me out for 3rd date. ",

I just keep things friendly and then I simply don't propose another date.

Maybe he's also hard to read in that sense, but because he's less communicative.",

I don't like the goodbye kiss, as it feels more of a formality and kind of empty, to be honest.\n\nBut yeah, he's probably just inexperienced, especially if he came out of a long-term relationship. He's possibly very nervous as well and might be overthinking as much or more than you, also wondering if you like him haha.",

        "text": "First-time Reddit poster here\u2014go easy on me!\n\nI just wanted to share a recent experience I had in the dating scene as an attractive, single woman in her 40s. It\u2019s been a while\u2014I've been single for 6 years\u2014and recently I met someone on Tinder. That alone was a big deal for me, because I don\u2019t usually connect with people on dating apps.\n\nThings progressed quickly. We spoke constantly for two weeks via text and phone. There was an emotional intensity that felt mutual\u2014lots of sweet messages, daily check-ins, even \"goodnight my love\" type things.\n\nWhen we finally met in person, we had a great night: dinner, an adult circus, and a hotel stay where we ended up sleeping together. During that night, he said things like:\n\n* \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this way about anyone before,\u201d\n* \u201cYou\u2019re going to ghost me after this, and it\u2019s going to hurt so much,\u201d\n\nHe said that last one multiple times\u2014enough that I actually had to ask him to stop. It made me uncomfortable, but I brushed it off.\n\nHe left early the next morning, saying he had promised (last-minute) to help his brother-in-law. It gave me a red flag, but when I brought it up later, he apologized, and I let it go.\n\nAfter that, we went back to texting. Everything seemed normal\u2014he continued expressing how much he liked me and missed me. Then, out of nowhere, a week and a half after our meet-up, he suddenly stopped replying.\n\nI couldn\u2019t get in touch with him one night, so I messaged, \u201cAre you alive?\u201d He eventually responded with just one word: \u201cUnfortunately.\u201d\n\nI tried calling\u2014no answer. A few hours later he texted that he got home at 4am and was going to sleep. I replied kindly, telling him to rest well. The next day, I didn\u2019t message until the afternoon, when I sent him a selfie. He reacted with a heart and said he hurt his back. And that\u2026 was the last I ever heard from him.\n\nI sent a few messages over the next 24 hours, genuinely concerned. I tried calling. Nothing. Eventually, I found his sister on Facebook and messaged her to check if he was okay or if I was just being ghosted. She said, \u201cAs far as I know, he's okay.\u201d\n\nThat hit hard. It confirmed what I didn\u2019t want to believe\u2014that I\u2019d just been ghosted. No explanation, no honesty\u2014just silence. I sent one final message to him via SMS and Messenger (since he hadn't even read my WhatsApp messages), asking politely if he\u2019d decided not to pursue this, could he just let me know for closure.\n\nHis reply?\n\"Please stop.\"\n\nThat was it. No explanation. Nothing.\n\nI was honestly shocked. After all the things he said, all the emotional intensity, the vulnerability, and intimacy\u2014we weren\u2019t even worth a simple goodbye?\n\nI guess I\u2019m just here to say: ghosting someone after a few messages is rude, but ghosting someone after weeks of connection and intimacy is cruel, It\u2019s cowardly. People who do this really need to understand the emotional damage it causes.\n\nThanks for letting me vent.",

        "text": "Long story short; I\u2019m a 34 year old male. Got married when I was 19; and I was with my ex-wife since I was 17 years old. We were separated for 2 years before our divorce was finalized in march. \n\nIt was 2 years of hell - all I\u2019ve done is gone to therapy, read psychotherapy style books, watch relationship videos on YouTube,  tried to figure out what went wrong, my failings in the marriage, own my role, workout, etc. \n\nI ended up dipping my toes into talking girls oh I don\u2019t know; fall of 2024 or so. (My ex left summer 2023) By that point I was feeling pretty over my ex and didn\u2019t think I would rebound. I had reconciled the fact (mostly anyway) that I would never be with her again. \n\nTalked to two girls in about a 4 month span. Both went the same way; talking every single day all day long, phone calls, etc to eventually meeting up, and then for one I decided to friend zone her because of completely misaligned values (I\u2019m monogamous; she wants a bi polyamory kinda deal)  and the other turned out to be coming out of a crazy DV situation and she ended up ghosting me lol \n\nI was a little upset about the 2nd girl; and I think she may have been my hero complex rebound. But got over it after just a bit.\n\nDecided to wait a while longer; wait until atleast the divorce was finalized. Well divorce is finalized and I go through a brand new mini downward spiral. After a month and a half, I end up being a dummy and posting a Facebook status announcing to the world that I was single and looking for a lady friend.\n\nWell; a lady reached out to me. She\u2019s 11 years older than me and I kept it pretty guarded at first. Real surface level stuff. End up seeing if she wants to go out on a date - we discussed our custody schedules and we set one up.\n\nNext thing I know we\u2019re instant messaging every day all day long. The day for the date arrives and she had to pull out last minute because of a custody related issue. Ok, no big deal. Met her on her lunch the next day and we just talked. We both expressed that it was a lovely time and wanted to do it again. \n\nCustody schedules making it a giant pain in the ass to meet up. I\u2019ve seen her once a week for about 45 minutes each since the first time.\n\nWe\u2019ve both expressed that we enjoyed it every time and we finally have time for a real date this coming Monday. \n\nWe\u2019re talking every day. Shared a lot of things with each other and whammo; I am falling for this girl (or atleast the idea of her) and it is causing me some tremendous anxiety.\n\nI think I might be in over my head. Maybe I\u2019m not ready for this. Am I just rebounding? She is so much more experienced than me and I have only ever been a husband. I don\u2019t even know how to date! \n\nI really found the idea of dating a woman who is older than me refreshing. Maybe she\u2019d help guide me how to do this (and she is, to a degree) but at the same time I am starting to feel like the idiot 12 year old boy who never kissed a girl before all over again.\n\nI\u2019m really excited for this date coming up and she does seem it too. But man, this anxiety/anticipation is much more than I thought it would be. Starting to want to chicken out; feel like I\u2019m just gonna screw it up!\n\nAny thoughts, tips, or advice is greatly appreciated! \n\n",

        "text": "Me (24f) and bf(22m) have been dating for a few months after being friends for two years. I have a big family and it seems like only a few of them really approve of him. My parents don\u2019t really want us together. I still live at home (it\u2019s rough out here ok) and I get anxious every time I ask if he can come over. Look, my parents are amazing people. They are friendly to him and they definitely don\u2019t treat him or me  badly because of this. They always agree to have him over. I guess just knowing that they would just prefer us not together kind of eats me up inside. I think the main reason they don\u2019t really want us together is because I\u2019m Catholic and he\u2019s part of a Catholic group that has an irregular relationship with the rest of the Catholic Church. They\u2019re have an \u201cirregular canonical status.\u201d This group means a lot to him but my parents have been worried about that from the very beginning. It could also be that my boyfriend also an intense personality overall. However he\u2019s respectful and not obnoxious at all. He hasn\u2019t gotten into any arguments or anything with my parents. They usually have normal conversations when they see him. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just a weird feeling I get. There\u2019s underlying tension. Both of my older siblings are married and my parents totally approve of their spouses. I always imagined myself being with someone that they do approve of. I  love my boyfriend a lot but \nI guess I just have to make the decision and accept the fact that they may never 100% approve or him or our relationship. Idk if things would be different if he left that church group. He\u2019s also a Catholic convert so that might also bring up some concerns with him.\nAnyways, has anyone else been in this situation and can you provide me any help or advice? Thank you!!",

        "text": "Hello all, this is so weird I\u2019m not much of a reddit poster at all. Basically, I(22f) recently got broken up with my (28m) boyfriend of 5 months. The real reason is still something I am trying to figure out, if on a deeper level there was more I could do. However, I\u2019m just posting on here to get a male opinion I guess. We have had a sort of steady relationship, moved very fast and both of us developed a sort of codependency on each other within the first month. Around month 2 he started voicing his irritation with the fact I\u2019m not in school or therapy, just working, and essentially that it stressed him out regarding the future. I had concerns at the time as well, not so much in that matter but more of getting to know more about his dating past. 2 serious ex girlfriends, 2 old coworkers he tried to go after(funny enough we were coworkers as well I was just new to the area and wasn\u2019t aware of his past) and a drug rep that would come into the office pretty regularly, that denied him around 1 week before we started seeing each other. We kind of figure out our problems at that time and move past it, only for the issue of again my motivation and basically introverted nature to pop back up. It became a regular thing super early, where I felt like every few weeks/every month I was having to justify myself and plead to stay in the relationship. I\u2019ve met his cousins a handful of times and the rest of his family twice, not counting his parents or his sister(Viet parents wanting their son to have a catholic Vietnamese girlfriend, neither of which I am and a sister who was veryyyy against us in the first place and made it known). He has been very helpful and supportive with things I am pursuing, I got back into therapy and started going to the gym with him and genuinely thought things were going good until last weekend. He recently helped me move and this was my first weekend in my home, actually having time to unpack and decompress after a veryyy stressful couple of weeks moving. Saturday we had plans to gym, go with him while he gets a sports massage, and go hang out until meeting up with his cousins later; and the morning of I kind of realized I needed a little bit of space, I had gotten ready to go and physically just couldn\u2019t leave my house. We were talking all morning on the phone and I communicated like \u201chey, I\u2019m burnt out and have a lot at home I still need to take care of, are you good if I come later and meet you at your house?\u201d And he said it was fine until I met up with him later and he was pissed. We still hung out and then went to his cousins for a small dinner and to go get boba after, but when we went for drinks we passed by his grandmothers house which prompted them to stop there(after I voiced I wasn\u2019t the most comfortable with it, his cousin and I had smoked a little before this and I was definitely still feeling it), where his OTHER cousin invited us to dinner the following night. This cousin invited everyone for dinner pretty regularly and no one ever goes, despite saying they will. So it was the regular like yeah sure knowing it wouldn\u2019t happen, we left and made plans to go to the range on Sunday and get lunch after with his cousin I smoked with. Sunday we go to range and get dinner everything is great and then went get back to my house and we nap, until cousin we hung out with asked if we were going to dinner where he was like idk. She said they were going and it would be at their grandmas house because it was another aunts birthday and I honestly just didn\u2019t want to go, so I told him that. I again communicated I\u2019m incredibly burnt out and in need of time alone, I didn\u2019t think that we would actually be going to dinner, and if it was ok with him I was gonna sit it out. He said it was fine and that I was exhausted, so to just rest. After leaving for dinner the mood completely changed, I got called flaky and uncommunicative, a people pleaser, and basically just super unreliable. He said I have proven multiple times I do not wish to better myself and broke up with me. Super out of the blue. I took a week and have really been sitting in it and a lot just doesn\u2019t sit right with me. His last text said that he wasn\u2019t mad, we both need time, and that if life brings us back we will figure it out then. Does this mean he\u2019s open to the possibility of working things out? How long do I wait before even trying to reconnect? We have returned each others things and he let me keep his old foam roller and Lego\u2019s he bought me, along with returning the V Day card I got him and whole little gift basket. Does the foam roller have any significance here? What about him returning the V Day stuff? I just don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ruined it or there\u2019s still a chance, or if it\u2019s even worth pursuing. I\u2019m in a new area and know no one but him, all of my friends were his and have all ghosted me since. My brother and sister in law, along with any additional family members who have met him, all believe that this is largely due to his sister\u2019s urging and mother\u2019s disinterest in meeting me, how do I fix this what can I say to make it better?",

But I found that it doesn't matter if it's online or in person they oversexualise me and offer nothing in terms of emotional care/connection. It's been this way since I was 14 and at this point I feel really sad and self conscious when anyone mentions my body. I would rather be alone than be with somone who only looks at my tits. I know I am not especially pretty and I am overweight so it's not like they are losing their mind from lust. They probably just think cause I am a little fat I must be easy. I am working hard on weightloss and hopefully imrpove my looks over the next couple of years through surgery but it's not easy in London. I was wondering if anyone else feels the same.",

And I get it, it's very hard. American society tells us we should be ashamed and feel like failures if we live with parents for any reason. It's difficult to pull a Captain American and tell the world \"no, you're wrong.\" \n\nSo you need to actively take agency for yourself and confidently say to her face that a woman who considers it a turn off isn't what you want in a partner. Women respond surprisingly well to this in reality, regardless of what they say online. It's like the confidence short circuits everything else. \n\nIf they ask why you think it's a turn off for them to hold this preference, then you can explain how a displayed lack of family values isn't a good thing when your end goal is raising a family with a woman. Who'd want to build a family with someone who expects you to abandon your current family just to be worthy of her attention? But the important thing is that you're confident and willing to preemptively reject a woman for beliefs like this. Once you show her that you are, a lot of the time you won't even have to. \n\nAt least that's what I've seen in the real world. The difference between whether a guy who lives with his parents gets a date or a relationship is so often tied to confidence rather than anything else, and I've seen women who rejected guys for this change their tune when they met one who was confident about their living situation.",

So many women don\u2019t have a problem dating them when looking for a stable LTR. \n\nMy question is do you think your financial will change or improve going forward? Are you interested in owing your own place at any point in the future? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t even require some crazy pathway to success.

We\u2019ve been dating for 7 months but are on a break.\n\nI\u2019m confused with my emotions. When I\u2019m dating someone, I feel this very strong need or anxiety to figure out if they are my husband. Because I fear wasting the other persons time and I fear hurting them. But also the goal of dating is to figure out if you can see a life long partnership (at least for me). But when I have these feelings or put this pressure on myself, it makes it really tough. Why do I feel the weight of needing to KNOW asap if this is my person. Just any advice on this topic would be amazing. I feel like I haven\u2019t been in any long term relationships due to this second guessing myself and feeling the need to figure it out in order to protect the other persons heart.\n\nI\u2019m also struggling to figure out if I am with him because iiii want to be and he makes meee happy vs am I with him because I care and want to make him happy. I\u2019m a pleaser and I care about people so much that I fear it clouds my judgement on if they are right for me. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m just overthinking stuff but anyone that has found their forever person or is in a marriage, I\u2019d appreciate any advice or helping me to understand these feelings I have or what the right thing to do is. Dating confuses me. ",
