        "text": "I (30M) have been seeing this girl (25F) for a few months. she sometimes gives me extra food that she made and says \"it's too much\" so she \"needs help getting rid of it.\" but let me just say, it's the BEST food i've ever had. Her friends also always talk about how good her food is so i know i'm not biased. she hasn't had extra food to hand out in awhile. I really want to ask her for more food but I can't figure out a way to ask without sounding like a misogynist who believes women belong in the kitchen. She has opened up to me before and expressed her frustration with cooking because it always felt like a chore for her when she had to cook for her younger siblings every day till she graduated from high school. she's had a hard life and grew up in foster care so i don't want to overstep and remind her of trauma. how does one ask? or should i just forget about it?",

Be a person who praises her skill, training and expertise. A person who sees her and lifts her up. Tell her how fun it to watch her cook. Don\u2019t fake this \u2014 be authentic. \n\n2. Suggest a date where you offer to bring a bottle of wine and pick up the groceries for any recipe she enjoys making.  Don\u2019t ask her what is her \u201cfavorite\u201d recipe, just what are some dishes she loves to cook would like to make. \n\n3. When she is finished cooking, or after dinner, or as she is mid-stream cooking but no longer needs some of the pots/pans/equipment, START DOING THE DISHES WITHOUT BEING PROMPTED AND WITHOUT BRINGING ATTENTION TO IT \u2014 just do it like you know it\u2019s time to do it. This is literally one of the hottest forms of foreplay on the planet, so ideally find a way to learn to enjoy doing the dishes, but if not, fake it. You are relieving her of the big drawback of cooking\u2026getting stuck w massive cleanup. (And if you roll up your shirt sleeves to visibly expose your forearms during the exercise, caution: extra powers may also be unleashed). \n\n4. Consider at some point gifting her a cookbook once you learn more about her style and approach to cooking.  PLENTY by Ottolenghi is an excellent candidate, bc if she starts cooking for you out of that particular book, every recipe is a guaranteed stone cold winner",

                "body": "Here\u2019s a perspective from someone in your girlfriends shoes: I also have to cook everything from scratch since I was 14 due to multiple food intolerances. It\u2019s a chore that literally everything has to be cooked from scratch, even if it means u have become a really good chef over the past 20 years since. But it\u2019s really exhausting when you\u2019re tired from work and there\u2019s just no shortcut.\n\nA few years ago i started seeing this guy, and because I can\u2019t really eat out at restaurant\u2019s either, I invited him over for dinner. Partly due to lack of alternatives like going out, as well as me being the significantly better chef between the two of us, this quickly became a dynamic where I ended up doing all the shopping, all the cooking, all the cleanup and twice the food bill. He thought he was really doing me a favour by telling me over and over how good my food is and that he can\u2019t get enough. I know my food is top-notch, thank you. But ultimately, even genuine appreciation isn\u2019t the same as reciprocation. I got tired of him real quick as this man added no value to my life beyond entertainment but became just one more chore for me. Thanks I\u2019ll just take Netflix and chill by myself over that.\n\nSo of course you can tell her how much you appreciate her cooking, but ultimately, think about what you can offer in exchange.\n\n- while you mention how much you like her cooking, ask her what part she doesn\u2019t like (other than the history of having to cook for her brother), then make a plan to take care of those parts. What I mean by that is that you should take care of getting the ingredients, and also give her a hand while she cooks. Chopping ingredients, doing the dishes as she\u2019s busy with other things etc. get a nice bottle of wine and buy/contribute by making a dessert. That way it\u2019s more reciprocal, you literally also \u201cbring something to the table\u201d, and it feels symbiotic that way.\n\n- like i have already commented on one of the other responses, make it a date. Cook together after perhaps going to a farmers market or making it part of a date. Strawberry picking? Wine tasting followed by some homemade food? \n\n- pay it forward: if you see she has little projects around the house (maybe checking something on her car, helping her mount that shelf that\u2019s been standing in the corner for weeks, or just doing something meaningful to her like getting her that book she was talking about, she will probably be more than happy to thank you with a delicious home cooked meal, and she will even want to do it. \n\nIt\u2019s ok for two people to have different skills and not being able to return a kindness in the exact same way, but make sure the effort you both put in stays balanced.",

On top of the cooking you are adding additional unpaid labor to her to-do list when you ask her to teach. Being parentified as a girl living in a patriarchal society is pretty traumatic and a lot of people replying to this thread clearly haven\u2019t experienced it. :/ I think if op asks her to teach him to cook he should be providing something VERY good in exchange for it precisely because she doesn\u2019t like doing it and has said it carries negative weight for her. Like others said, he could pay for the ingredients and do the grocery shopping + dishes. Op should also make it clear he wants to learn to do it so that he can take the load off and do it FOR her as WELL as enjoy that type of food himself. \n\nAnother thing to consider: maybe part of why it tastes so good to OP is because he feels nurtured when he eats food she made. He should ask himself if he could find other ways to feel nurtured by her which don\u2019t involve her doing cooking for him.\n\nAt the end of the day you also need to respect if she draws a boundary and says no. End of discussion. There\u2019s other great food out there and we are never entitled to anything from our partner. All we can do is ask them and hope they\u2019ll do what we would like.",

Younger girls would just ghost me or wouldn't bother even texting, but not her... Honestly, I always felt more attracted to older women. They don't play games, know what they want and i love their maturity. I dated once a older woman and it remains the most meaningful connection I've ever felt. Of course, it wasn't without some disapproval of such relationship from my family and public eyes. You can change your thoughts up there, but down there, you can't change what is coming from your heart. I like this woman a lot. What do you think? Should I go for it? ",

The Main reason is expect her crash-out to be the likes of which you never seen. When the relationship got bad she decided not to leave civilly or try to repair it, but to instead, make it pure chaos and then leave. I thought that because she was a mother of 4 (with two fathers) she was mature and stable. What it really was, is that she had an additional 15 years of experience on me. She was used to manipulating and enduring hard relationships she created, so the maturity I expected going in was actually bitterness instead. I got to be on the receiving end of that and I got through it pretty well all things considered. (She tried to convince me the be father #3 but I refused).  Regardless I didn\u2019t deserve being put through the wringer at 25, trauma is real. I\u2019ll take a more reasonable crash-out from someone my own age to someone older that is more skilled at detaching than crashing. \n\nTLDR- I dated 15 years older and got a crash-out 15 years beyond my comprehension. Be prepared to endure the consequences of the age gap experience. \n\nYou\u2019ve been warned, it\u2019s not always best to learn the hard way.",

That in itself is a HUGE red flag unless valid reasons like divorce, death etc but someone that has been in the market for 30yrs and hasn\u2019t had some sort of next level commitment like marriage or even engagement or a long long relationship (like 10yrs) is a walking red flag. \n\n\nThe age gap is also very wide. I had a thing with a 40yo when I was 24 and it was fun until it wasn\u2019t. I was meeting her friends and they were legit older looking. My mom was 12yrs older than this woman. So obviously the age gap caught up with us and we ended. So enjoy her, she\u2019ll prob be so much fun and will care for you better than any woman you\u2019ve dated have, it\u2019ll almost be like a mom figure, but don\u2019t get too attached",

A lot of us older women do not like to be judged in relationships. We want a serious one. If we accept young men, people will call us the young guy's Sugar Mommy. And will judge us as toying younger men to feel \"young\". We really dont like that.\n\nWhats worst is that we fear we are growing old with wrinkles compare to the younger man. We would fear that you will look for younger women and will either cheat on us or leave us.....\n\nThese are the most common fears we \"older\" women would face. We want a serious relationship. We dont want to act like old men who wants younger women to flex and fool around... We want real commitment. \n\nI'm sorry but you need to let her go. For her sake. The reason she hasnt let you go is because she havent met you in person. Once she saw you IRL, she will have second thoughts. \n\nIf you want someone like her, find a grandma girl. These are girls who acts like a grandma. Or a mommy girl. These are girls who act like better than their mom at caring for the family, and are always strict about family values. \n\nI wish you luck on your search.",

Like any relationship keep regard of a course and that has nothing to do with age. I have seen equally abusive and manipulative relationships begin of why age steps no eggs gas male female Etc so that doesn't matter to be honest. I speak from personal experience. Almost the same scenario, I am in my 50s and my wife is in her mid-20s. I have been divorced for many years was a single father for many years because of that. I had no interest in never beginning another relationship. I casually dated a few girls that always been friends for it but they knew I had no intent for a relationship or even a one-night stand or present benefits as my past marriage ended up with severe abuse toward two out of three of our children. That and realizing that she lied about loving me from the start and admitted to what I was realizing that she was just using me from the beginning on for a variety of reasons. While I still trusted people friends Etc to the same extent that I always had, I developer this taste the relationships to the point that I thought they were not needed at least for me. I had not become cynical and I didn't portray my thoughts and opinions on to others but that is Where I Stood and I was fine being single. I had my volunteering my work my dogs visiting with my adult kids Etc. I met my current wife when she was 19 and I was in my late 40s. We were volunteering at the University which I had frequently done for the last 5 or 6 years and that was the first time we had met and we were on the same project. We hit it off from the beginning I got a long extremely well from day one work together well even joked some and talk about our lives a little bit but nothing personal. The project was about a week long and after that we went our separate ways as friends but did not keep in touch at all didn't even exchange phone numbers or anything. A few months later we both ended up volunteering on a project together again and this was not even at the University was out in the public community. We recognize each other instantly and ended up being placed on the same team once again. This project was almost a month long and we continue talking to each other as if it was never a break and communication. No offense against her but the first time we met at the university is volunteering I didn't pay any attention or mine to her at all other than just chatting with a project teammates. You're the end of the month, we both knew we wanted to ask each other's phone numbers but were leery of doing it as we both thought we were leading the other person wrong about wanting to continue our friendship. When there was about a week left to the project I had mentioned to her that if she would like I could give her my phone number in case you wanted to keep and talk to each other. She smiled and said she was so glad I asked because she's been wanting to exchange numbers since about halfway through the project but was too nervous to do it because she thought she was being stupid but I wouldn't be interested in keeping friends and who are asap. It seems numbers and talk on the phone and met up a number of times before we both started realizing that there was more than friendship between us and that it was on both sides. The story gotten too long so obviously over time over a few years things evolved they dated gotten days and then got married last year. We have had much interactions at the public and their reaction lungs from not feeding us any different than any other trouble to assuming we're father and daughter and then usually very apologetic and interested and they discover it's not that kind of relationship. All the way to some people just looking and staring or giving dirty looks or straight out the other end of the scale where they pull her aside after she's okay and does she want a safe place to escape to or say that she needs to leave me because I'm just grooming her for sex trafficking her. Having known each other for a number of years now he's gotten to the point where we can laugh the bad stuff off unless they continue then one of us or both usually chime in to end it politely and professionally with the other person. I would have so sick situation that you're in right now the same way I would with anything regardless of the relationship regardless of an age Gap. Treat it as you would anything else in life. If it's something that you're passionate about and want to pursue it and as long as it doesn't hurt the other person their self or anyone then nothing's just standing your way. We have been together, counting from that month-long project the second time we met until today a little over 6 years and we have very much in common always has and at the same time those things that she has wanted to do or I have wanted to do on my own and not together for example going on a two or three types backpacking camping Expedition alone or something she had wanted to do after she was going through some extinct stresses in her life and ask me how I dealt with all things I've been through and I explained to everyone's different of course but to me nature Made Me much more relaxed as allowed me to pray better and feel closer to conversing with God. She tried it and it helped you so much but it was two weeks she was up and decided to go. I knew the area she was going to and she would text me twice a day sometimes three times a day to let me know if she was okay. I didn't text her myself out right first as not for the server. She came back I totally different person in a good way. What I'm trying to say is approaches like any relationship with caution respect and lost if it is there on your end and expect those same things from her and back each other up when someone in the public eye whatever family friends or strangers judgmental in some way. Have a code with each other where you'll handle the issue the cells but if you want help from the other person then you'll note about each other up. Anyone who's bothers to read this I apologize for his life and I also apologize for anything that may not make sense as this entire post was voice texted as I'm at work right now. Again to the op if you want to message me feel free to anytime",

What I\u2019ve come to realize is that my ex was so interested in keeping the relationship she was willing to hide who she truly was with me, but when it came to her friends and family, she turned into the most hateful, rude, and ignorant woman I had  ever met in my existence. She was the same age at the time as your gf now. I strongly recommend moving with a watchful eye and try not to get overly attached. Chances are high that this girl may have some deep rooted insecurities and may covertly have an undying need for validation. How she goes about it tactfully depends on the group. Again.

If she constantly shows disrespect, stand with your values and stay strong.\n\nOne thing though, relationships are hard sometimes so see how she acts after apologizing and also make sure she knows her friends are toxic. She can decide who is more important to her, you or her toxic friends.\n\nGood luck and always here as a friend!",

That performative shift she pulled isn\u2019t about being \u201changry.\u201d It\u2019s about hierarchy. She wanted to look powerful in front of her friends, so she dominated you socially. She made herself look bigger by making you look small. That\u2019s not a mood swing. That\u2019s a strategy.\n\nWomen will often test men in private. But what matters even more is how she acts when the social stakes are higher... when her friends are watching. If her way of signaling value is to mock, undermine, or condescend to you in front of her peers, it\u2019s not just disrespect. It\u2019s a future preview. This is how she will relate to you when your relationship stops being new.\n\nYou need to ask yourself a serious question: If this is her at her \u201crealest\u201d around her core people, do you like what you see? Now, a few practical moves.\n\nCall it out directly. Not emotionally. Not with drama. Say: \u201cThat wasn\u2019t hunger. That was you trying to look cool in front of your friends. I don\u2019t accept being treated like that.\u201d Watch the next encounter. If it happens again, walk. Once is a flag. Twice is a pattern. Don\u2019t overexplain your worth. The financial sizing-up from her friends? It wasn\u2019t just about your wallet. That's was about whether you\u2019re \u201cworthy\u201d of her in their eyes. That entire social interaction was a tribal value test. The second you feel like you have to prove yourself to people you\u2019re not dating, you\u2019ve already lost the way others perceive the relationship. \n\nThis isn\u2019t just about respect. It\u2019s about polarity, status, and partnership. She doesn\u2019t need to worship you, but she damn sure shouldn\u2019t be using you as a prop to elevate herself either.

After talking to someone everyday for that long it just feels like there\u2019s a void now. I really only have 3 legit friends. 2 of them are engaged, 1 moved across the country, and I don\u2019t feel comfortable talking to any of them about this. I\u2019ve known all of them for over a decade and we\u2019ve never really discussed our dating lives with each other. I gather that\u2019s normal for guys but idk. This to say, I don\u2019t really have anyone to talk to about this. \n\nI tried going on Tinder. Not because I\u2019m looking for anything, I really don\u2019t want to jump right back into dating, but just to try and talk to someone to take my mind off it. I\u2019m not the most attractive guy in the world, but I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m not hideous (\u00bf). Likes are few and far between. When I do match with someone I try to send a fun message but no one ever messages back. \n\nI just feel really alone and lost. I\u2019m 28 so I\u2019m not young and I don\u2019t exactly have a friend group to go out with to meet people. I know it\u2019s not reasonable to think but I can\u2019t help but feeling I\u2019ll be alone for the rest of my life and that really scares me. \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve had my head down my whole life either doing what I love or in recent years, work, but now I\u2019ve picked it up and I\u2019m looking around and realizing there\u2019s no one there. \n\nNeeded to vent into the ether.

You showing them you trust them to be vulnerable can make you feel closer, and also show them they can do the same with you when they need to. And even if you don't feel up to discussing the break up, having someone to talk to about other things can still help you feel less alone. \n\nNext, it's not too late to make friends. I know it's easy to think everyone has their social groups set by this age and it's impossible to break in, but that's not true. Sure, it is for some people, but there's also a hell of a lot of other 28 year olds who are similarly lonely, or just have more room for friends in their lives. Figure out what hobbies you have that can involve in person social events. If there aren't any, try some new hobbies. Then introduce yourself to people there, make conversation, and see who you vibe with. It might take a few attempts, and just like dating, there will be people who are just not interested, but it's worth it. A year from now you could find yourself with a solid group that give you so much confidence and joy you can barely even recognise this guy who feared he'd be alone forever.\n\nAs someone who's moved countries/cities several times in my adult life, and similarly had a moment looking around after a long relationship breakup and realising I didn't really have any friends, this is how I made all the friends I have in adulthood. For me it was getting stuck into the local music scene and volunteering at festivals, but really it just depends what you are into. Climbing gyms I've heard are particularly supportive environments filled with people in our age range, and they usually run some form of social or beginners events weekly. Film clubs can be another good one. Really, the world is your oyster. You don't need existing friends to go out and meet people, and honestly I find it easier to meet people when I am out solo, because then I'm motivated to actually chat with strangers instead of just sticking in my comfort zone with my friends.",

Your wife could die one day, or you may end up divorced.

Or I guess best case scenario, you'd be finding another person looking to use someone as a distraction.

I started going on walks and listening to funny podcasts (shxtsngigs always makes me laugh). \nThere are days where it does get sad and lonely, but I found that having constant back ground noise helps a lot. I would also recommend buying items that smile at you in a cute way. I believe Lego\u2019s is coming out with a smiling plant set, I highly recommend you get those and if not those any Lego set should work.

The relationship was great until I found out at the last six months of us being together he 20M (at the time) cheated on me with another girl at the college we went to. That was about two years ago. I have gone on a couple dates maybe four months after that relationship. some dates were fun, some weren\u2019t but I really just tried to focus on myself and studies. However, there has been a few times where I really saw potential in someone, mutually pursued them but it ends up in the guy doing some of these things: \u201ches not ready for a relationship\u201d , taking me on dates to attempt to get into my pants, or just keeping me on their \u201croster\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t know what im doing wrong. I have hobbies so I won\u2019t be obsessing over a guy, I work, I go to school, I actively communicate so there is no room for misunderstanding, I always try to create a safe space for whoever the guy im talking to feels comfortable to express feelings.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be cocky but I am a rather beautiful woman, and people have always told me that dating will always be hard for me. I just feel so discouraged. People always tell me to love myself and I don\u2019t need to love anyone but myself but is it so bad that I would like to share my love and support to someone. I know I am still young but thats just something that i want. If it doesn\u2019t last forever, that\u2019s okay as long as I can say I experienced what it means to love someone and to have someone love me.\n\nIs there something wrong with me?",

She was in a group of 3 guys and 2 girls that she spent a long time with and introduced me to them. As the crowds began to change and leave I spent more time with the group. Initially it was pretty bad, the guys weren't bad but were sort of passive, but the girls looked at me like I was some kind of creep (I wasn't trying to hit on them or anything) and wouldn't talk to me. There were moments where I felt boxed out of the group by putting their back towards me. \n\nEventually I walked away from the group, I found my friend and told her that I think her group didn't like me. She said something along the lines of \"they'll like you they just don't know you\". She went back to the group (and may have mentioned me) and I just hung out with myself for a little bit before going back.\n\nThey seemed to be a little more open, one of the girls told me she liked another guy in the bar, I tried to help her but she didn't want it. At least she mentioned it to me. Later on the group moved closed to the music and began to dance. Everyone got more loose and relaxed with me. The last girl let me hold her purse since I was already holding my friend's already. The other girl may have even touched me as she yelling into my ear (we were way too close to the music). Both of them hugged me goodbye, one of held me surprisingly tight and other was good with me walk her to her car (my friend suggested it).\n\nMoral of the story: Even with the best intentions you will still look like a creep. Don't let that stop you from taking those risks.",

I\u2019ve met a few girls on Bumble and had some decent success \u2014 nothing long-term yet, but it\u2019s been a good learning experience so far.\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve genuinely noticed, though, is that almost every girl I\u2019ve gone out with tends to talk almost exclusively about themselves \u2014 their job, their friends, their hobbies, their day-to-day life. And that\u2019s fine to an extent, but I feel like there\u2019s very little interest shown in me or my world. I\u2019ll try to share my perspective or experiences, and it often just kind of gets brushed aside or redirected.\n\nIs this a common thing guys experience when dating?

It\u2019s kind of reassuring (in a weird way) to hear that this isn\u2019t just a one-sided issue though \u2014 seems like a lot of people are still figuring out the balance in conversation. Hopefully both of us get better matches next time!",

Or, maybe they're just plain shallow have nothing to say outside of themselves ( a common trait I have found for men and women). \n\n As far as women, it could also be a technique they directly (or indirectly) partake in order to test or gauge your level of interest in them since there isn't any real barrier to entry really anymore in modern dating. Similarly, some women ( or girls rather) will also play 'uninterested' with texting, in order to gauge your interest and to see how far you will work for them. Of course this is immature behavior, so you have to choose whether or not to put up with it. Most of the ones I encounter doing this are fairly physically attractive..perhaps a connection there. \n\n In general, I have found this behavior to be common among younger women in general who are still learning the ropes in communication, some of them happily conscious about it, others happily unconscious. So, to reply to your question, yes, this happens a lot!  However, men also engage in this. I have had many a friend, God bless them, that just go on an on about themselves..In short, people who do this consciously, are playing a game( and it's all a game) of:\n\n \"Impress me (women)..aka, dance for me, baby\" \n\nand \"I will certainly impress you to no end (men).\" \n\nGood luck out there!",

But at least in my personal experience, it's important to be weary about whether this is all the women want. I was quite often in the situation when she dropped \"I only see you as a friend\", despite not really listening to me whenever I told her something. I think a lot of women just enjoy the attention and the emotional comfort of an attentive listener. It makes me feel used on a regular basis and I therefore also have to drop women on a regular basis, at least when it is possible.\n\n\nSome women really care though and can listen too, at least in my experience it's just much more common that they keep on talking about themselves.\u00a0",
