        "post-author": "ThrowRA-ow_yyy",
        "text": "This all happened a month or so ago, my wife's best friends husband let me know after a few beers. The wife had confided in her friend that basically she had a silly fling, cancelled it all and felt terribly guilty and remorseful. We otherwise have a happy healthy relationship, maybe after 10 years and 2 kids she needed some excitement?\n\nAnyway my question. Do I risk souring our dynamic by asking her about it? Or do I bury it and continue our normal lives\n\nMy issue with the later is every now and then I get a unfounded paranoia but I'm confident there is nothing going on. Will that feeling go or do I have to ask her? I don't want the guilt to hangover the relationship that one of us broke that trust and will be always living up to that.\n\nTLDR wife of 10 years cheated, ignore it or confront.",

I\u2019m sorry husband, but I had a fling with this guy at work, but no biggie, I went ahead and canceled so now the fling is over.\n\nDude, your wife was fucking someone else behind your back and you\u2019re asking should you let it go or bring it up? Do you honestly not care all that much? Is it that you honestly aren\u2019t that upset, or you still haven\u2019t fully wrapped your head around it? \n\nNobody needs to the fun and excitement of fucking someone else to figure out they should stay with their partner and not do things that are hurtful or risk ending the relationship. That\u2019s not realizing you still love your partner, that\u2019s realizing something isn\u2019t better than you thought it would be and won\u2019t leave your partner for that. It doesn\u2019t take that action to come to that conclusion, for anyone that isn\u2019t a selfish person. \n\nI mean the reason it\u2019s popping into your head is because she lied and hid this from you and continues to do so. So now you don\u2019t know if she would do it again or not. You don\u2019t know if she\u2019s still doing it or not. You are setting yourself up for a lifetime of anxiety and her possibly continuing to cheat and/or eventually leave you if you don\u2019t talk to her and found out why the fuck she cheated in the first place.\n\nGather evidence, talk to her, tell her you need absolute honesty, and then ask her to explain what all happened and listen to what she\u2019s truthful about and what she lies about. Go from there, see if you still want to make things work after. If she\u2019s 100% honest, straightforward, and shows remorse, then that\u2019s up to you man. This is an absolute dealbreaker for me and I recommend it be the same for you if she tries to lie about it, hide things, trickle truth, say it\u2019s not a big deal or it\u2019s over with, not actually working to find the reason that led her to her decisions, etc. because those aren\u2019t signs that she actually feels bad and regrets it when she\u2019s more concerned about how she\u2019s perceived vs being honest.",

That isn't an excuse. You cheated instead of (doing x hobby) **and that was a choice.** Im not a fucking jester. If the relationship was dry, you would have as much responsibility as me to make it fun. You still chose cheating.\"\n\n(You made me mad excuse)\n\"If being annoyed/pissed with me is permission to cheat, then I have a lot of catching up to do and a ton of questions about your past actions.\"\n\n(I enjoyed the attention)\n\"I dont know if you're telling me you're insecure or easy here, but neither of those are good reasons to betray your family. You should have done the work to be better if it was this bad, or at least asked for help.\"\n\nMake a list of demands  I would add a task she doesn't like or that you ususally do to the list until you feel ready to forgive her - like taking out the trash, doing the dishes, something simple you used to do.\n\nYou can take over the task again or share the task when you start to find forgiveness in you. It will be symbolic on top of literal and emotional and will make the forgiveness that much more meaningful if it comes.\n\nOr just leave if you cant deal, shich is normal.",

This doesn't sound like a drunken one night stand, but more of a deliberate straying with someone in her circle. OP needs to get this out in the daylight. He's still in the shock phase.

When you sit her down, lead by letting her know that you love her, you love your marriage, and you want to be clear that you're not going anywhere, but that you think you need to talk about this together because you want to face everything in your marriage together, even this. I think that if it set the tone that way and she doesn't feel threatened or trapped when you say what you know, it will help keep the conversation from going off the rails and help her open up to you instead of getting defensive.

About 70% of us/them, probably would struggle the same way with what REALLY to do. \n\nYou may want to consider watching her and finding out on your own if things are still happening or not. I guess this really all depends on your level of self confidence and what you think you know about what happened. First off your bro is a keeper for telling you. Thank him profusely. Also, ask him if there was more he didn\u2019t tell you. What kind of fling would weigh on my decision. The fact she felt guilty on her own says a lot. But how much you can forgive is only a thing you can define. We all have different levels that we can handle and how well you can let go matters. \n\nThen decide what to do. i might consider looking back to see if there were signs. I might also consider if she\u2019s more into your relationship now, but most importantly what would affect my choices would be if i could live with what i knew. I probably would try to find more dirt.In all honesty id probably look through messages, or my phone bill to find numbers etc, I\u2019d be skeptical and I\u2019d try to find a way to make her confess. If she\u2019s gotten rid of everything without you knowing, good sign it\u2019s over. If she\u2019s more into you, bring it up. Say what gives you? A few months ago you seemed distant, now you\u2019re back. \n\nYou have to be more vigilant and ask what can you do better. This isn\u2019t an excuse for you to step out, but if you find evidence you need to confront. Or she will do something again. If your doing, is tolerable in your head and not a deal breaker, if you don\u2019t confront and you don\u2019t find evidence , then work on building your relationship better, hold her accountable for her part and thank yourself she stupidly did something and course corrected before she went too far.",

You\u2019re clearly not trying to blow up your life, but you\u2019re also not trying to live a lie.\n\nThe fact that you\u2019re still describing your marriage as happy and healthy says a lot. It means there\u2019s love, history, and real connection there. But trust\u2014once it\u2019s cracked, even a little\u2014can infect everything if it\u2019s not dealt with.\n\nYou\u2019re asking the right questions. The paranoia you\u2019re feeling? That\u2019s your mind trying to protect you from future pain. And no, unfortunately, it probably won\u2019t just go away. If you try to bury it, it might pop up in weird places later\u2014resentment, distance, random anger, or just that quiet space between you two that never feels the same.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to go into the conversation looking for punishment. This isn\u2019t about revenge or shame. It\u2019s about reclaiming honesty in your relationship\u2014for your own peace, not just to \u201cget answers.\u201d If she\u2019s truly remorseful and the fling ended as quickly as it started, there might be a path forward. But it has to start with truth. Otherwise, you\u2019re not really healing\u2014just numbing.\n\nAsk yourself: Can you truly live with not knowing more? Can you accept it and move on as things are? Or will this silence eat at you over time?\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d talk to her. Not to accuse, but to open the door for real, raw conversation. If your marriage is strong, it can take that. And maybe come out better for it.\n\nWhatever you do, do it from a place of clarity, not fear. You deserve peace\u2014whether that means rebuilding trust together or reevaluating things with eyes wide open.\n\nYou\u2019re not crazy. You\u2019re just human.",

I\u2019d be prepared to book some couples counseling. Maybe she won\u2019t. Maybe she will just apologize profusely. \n\nBut will an apology be enough for you?

(Oral STI Concerns) Cheating is bad enough but giving zero fucks about your spouse\u2019s health is especially evil. \n\nHow long did it go on? (After the first time with the other guy it is very much no longer \u201ca mistake excuse\u201d) Why did she do it and was it worth blowing up your family for the guy? Why didn\u2019t she confess to you if she felt truly guilty and remorseful?\n\nWhat steps is she willing to take in order to regain your trust and make sure this never happens again?  I\u2019d also strongly recommend both couples and individual counseling to explore why she made that choice and also to help you cope with this terrible situation. \n\nUltimately it\u2019s your marriage and you know it better than strangers on the internet.

Everyone here is telling you to confront her and file for divorce, but none of us really understand your relationship dynamics.\n\nFor example, I have friends who are swingers or are in open relationships. They have established ground rules, and in some cases, that means sleeping with other people. The way that you talk though, it doesn't really sound like this is the case in your relationship.\n\nYou also don't mention what happened. Was it emotional, was it physical, how far did they go, etc.? If you are in a committed monogamous relationship, none of those are acceptable without some serious communication before going there.\n\nUltimately, I would confront her about it, but how you do so will depend on what you want to get from the discussion. Are you wanting to end the relationship due to the betrayal? Are you willing to explore a more open relationship, such as swinging, polyamory, open relationships, etc. to bring in some of the excitement that you think she might be missing? Are you willing to work with a marriage counselor to solve things? I wouldn't want to ignore this personally because I know that it would fester and lead to more problems in the future, and it will come out in weird ways that will strain your relationship. But I would take the time to look into options going forward so that you can discuss options with your wife if you are open to this. You also have kids in this situation, which makes things more complicated, and your future relationship with her is going to affect your kids.\n\nI was once cheated on by a girlfriend when she kissed her ex-boyfriend (she was upfront about something happened and was remorseful, but my mind went through all kinds of scenarios until she was clear about what had happened). I was not happy about it, and it did cause a lot of strain (we were already having problems though). But I reached out to a couple friends to ask questions (both women, one friend was in an open relationship and another was a swinger) to figure out what their approach was and how things worked for them, including their ground rules. I had a list of questions that they answered quite frankly and openly (I had explained what had happened and why I was asking, and asked if they would be open to talking about things). It wasn't really something that appealed to me, but I was curious and willing to give it a try. My girlfriend and I talked about things and I gave her time to think. In the end, it wasn't something that either of us wanted. We also tried relationship counseling, but that wasn't effective either. So in the end, we parted ways but remained friends, and she is a good friend to this day, and I think a part of that is because of how I chose to handle things.",

An emotional affair is likely easier to come back from for many people. Depending on what all entailed during the emotional affair and its length.",

And wondering if pretending everything is fine is the best way to protect what you\u2019ve built. I want to tell you something clearly, with zero judgment: you\u2019re not weak for wanting to preserve your family. And you\u2019re not overreacting for wanting the truth.\n\nBut here\u2019s the deal: if you bury this, it will not disappear. It will root itself in your bones, in your tone of voice, in the way you second-guess her affection or feel the silence between you stretch longer than it used to. You don\u2019t want to become the man who slowly disconnects because he couldn\u2019t bring himself to say the one hard thing. And you don\u2019t want your marriage to become a lie you both perform to protect the image of love, instead of the reality of it.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t have to be a blowup. It doesn\u2019t have to be war. But it does have to be real. Because your nervous system already knows. Your gut already knows. And the question isn\u2019t \u201cshould I confront this?\u201d The question is: what version of me do I become if I don\u2019t?\n\nYou say she felt guilty. That she ended it. That she told someone close. That tells me this wasn\u2019t some cold-blooded betrayal... it was a rupture. And if she\u2019s truly remorseful, there might be space to rebuild something even stronger. But only if the fire is faced. Not hidden. Not denied.\n\nWhen you speak to her, speak from the man you are now, not the hurt husband, not the suspicious detective, but the sovereign man who has nothing to prove and nothing to hide. You can say: \u201cThere\u2019s something I know. I haven\u2019t brought it up until now because I wanted to feel steady when I did. I love you. I respect what we\u2019ve built. But if something broke between us, I need us to face it together, not pretend it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nThat opens the door, not to punish her, but to invite her into truth. And from there, you\u2019ll know if she\u2019s really with you. Not just physically. But emotionally. Spiritually. Intimately. Because here\u2019s what no one tells you: trust isn\u2019t built by being perfect. It\u2019s built by being real. And if you have any shot at making this marriage deeper, not just longer, it starts with the courage to bring this into the light.\n\nWhatever happens next, you walk through it with your head high. Because you didn\u2019t betray her. You didn\u2019t lie. And you didn\u2019t hide. You led. And that\u2019s the kind of man your kids, your future, and even your wife need you to be now.",

Trust is so important. Talk about what happened. Why did they do it - what was the unmet need? How could thry have provided it to themselves or could have asked you to help them meet their need.

I think it all the time on bad days, would my partner still want me if he met me today with my gray hair? It's not a reason to cheat but also people are human and mistakes happen. I dunno man I think if you guys love each other and otherwise have a good relationship with each other, that's not nothing. Part of the trust is being able to talk about mistakes when they happen and move past them together. She's dropped the ball here and knows she fucked up, but is probably staying quiet out of fear of hurting you or wrecking what you have together.

This is probably the best time to approach your wife, because you're able to see ways to work through your feelings and see a life with her after. Most victims of cheating are very emotional and can act irrationally, and you can start this conversation on a very different plane. I'd encourage you to approach her calmly, but let her know that you know and you want to discuss what happened, why it happened, what's missing in your relationship that she was seeking, and how you both can go about addressing that and in the future have discussions about both your feelings so this doesn't happen again on either side. \n\nGood luck to you, and as someone who has successfully navigated infidelity I wish you the best!",

It is ALL her choices. You do not have to tell her who told you period. \n\nConfront her hard. Tell her you was told, but refuse to say who. Demand answers. If you need to, demand her devices and socials be opened to allow you to look. And if she choose to share this information with her friend where you found out you can then speak on it without fear of exposing the other husband. If she did it once, and got away with it, the risk is to repeat. The main reasons someone changes in never cheats again is if they are caught and forced to actual be held accountable to their partner. Right now, she did it without you knowing in her mind. Even if she has guilt, she knows she got away with what she did in her mind. If she has to face you knowing, being hurt; that adds to the power of will for those who change and never cross those lines again knowing what the pains actually did to the partner they cheated on.",

Im so sorry yoir going through this, and i can't imagine what it is doing to you emotionally, physically, or mentally. My advice to you is, is this something you can and will forgive if she doesn't bring it to the forefront? Or will you not trust her anymore? If it continues to eat at you, then confront her, but not before you tell her best friend that you know. This may be the push your wife needs to be upfront about it. It's not over, and with some therapy, if you feel you need it, it will still work out.",

        "text": "I have been with my husband for four years, three weeks ago while we were looking at houses I brought up my cold feet towards having kids. I was met with silence and he left the room. This continued for a few days, he\u2019d shut down anything I said about it. \n\nThen I was hit with all of it: I didn\u2019t respect him, I\u2019d be an amazing mother, im the problem with society, I\u2019m the love of his life and I\u2019m robbing the future because im coddled too much, I manipulated him by picking baby names. It was a lot and I didn\u2019t know how to respond. So I just said that I\u2019d think about it. Nothing more was said, this was three weeks ago but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s relevant\n\nYesterday we went to his friend\u2019s house party. I remember having a fair bit to drink and falling asleep on the couch. He carried me to bed, I remember him telling me he loves me, and I remember sleeping with him. Prior to this night we\u2019ve always used condoms, but it was very apparent that he hadn\u2019t used one when I woke up in the morning. \n\nHim and his friend were in the lounge room, my phone was flat, I wandered around for a while and then I started crying. \n\nI really can\u2019t describe the atmosphere but it was like reality was bent. My husband was yelling at his friend to order me food while trying to comfort me, and somehow I was letting myself be comforted while I broke down in front of his friend while the Big Bang theory was playing on the TV. Then when the food came that I didn\u2019t want or ask for he was frantically trying to shove chips in my mouth that I wasn\u2019t eating and I just had a bunch of potato sitting in my mouth while I cried. Like all that was needed in this situation was a rapid chip force feeding. It was insanity. \n\nAt no point did EITHER of them ask what was wrong. They both defaulted to telling me that nothing was wrong. Then somehow I started to believe it. We didn\u2019t leave until that afternoon, I didn\u2019t get the morning after pill until today and I was told it was an accident.\n\nI fear I may be completely overreacting but it felt so easy to believe in the moment that he\u2019d done something terrible especially with that conversation so fresh.

                                "body": "If you were not incapacitated, were aware of your surroundings, and were able to consent, you were not sexually assaulted, full stop. Lots of comments confidently asserting that you were - these people don't know what they're talking about. There are limited jurisdictions where it's considered sexual assault to intentionally remove a condom or lie about putting one on when you've specifically consented to sex with a condom, but without a more express discussion about it here I doubt it would meet the elements of that offense anywhere. There is this public (mis)conception that you can't legally consent to sex when you're drunk, but legally the threshold is *much* higher than that for incapacitation. So I would not recommend you either thinking of it in those terms (for your own mental health) or confronting him with that terminology (because it isn't accurate).\n\nThat doesn't mean he didn't take advantage of you or the situation, in a moral sense. That's something you'll have to discuss and think over for yourself. I think there's some indicators here that he did so, and frankly because none of us were there, none of us are going to have as good of a read of the situation as you will. We also don't have access to your husband and can't talk to him, gauge his reactions, etc.\n\nI will point out a couple things I did notice, just to offer a counterpoint to your initial impressions: \n1. You describe his reaction and his friend's demeanor as seeming guilty. The actions you described - seeming overly concerned, ordering food, etc. - also sound like they could be a reaction to seeing you be very visibly upset and freaked out. Not being there, I can't say one way or the other. You *were* there, so you can think about all this and assess for yourself. \n2. I saw some comments saying his reaction to your telling him you don't want kids was proof he's manipulative. I get the sense you recognize that telling him this - after discussing it previously, prior to marriage, and saying you wanted kids, even discussing baby names - must have been extremely emotionally devastating to him. Honestly, this would truly be world shattering for a lot of men (and women!). That absolutely would not excuse him purposefully trying to get you pregnant without discussing it after that, but in terms of evaluating his emotional state when he spoke to you, that evening in general, etc., I think your recognition of that being particularly impactful on him is accurate and relevant. \n3. I think that as an absolute minimum, you two need therapy. That's the best case scenario. There is clearly a lot of damaged trust here and this marriage, if you decide you want to stay in it, will not long survive if you don't repair that trust and get on the same page. \n\nI wish you, sincerely, the best luck in all this.",

He also doesn\u2019t verbally abuse you for potentially changing your mind on something important like kids. He doesn\u2019t punish and stonewall you until, presumably, he hopes you\u2019ll give in to what he wants.\n\nA normal partner, a reasonable partner, respects that people\u2019s wants and goals change. He discusses future plans like an adult, instead of browbeating and ignoring you, and then trying to baby trap you. I hope you know that\u2019s all insane. And incredibly unhealthy. \n\nYour relationship is not safe. He is not safe. I\u2019d suggest taking some time away to think \u2014 really think \u2014 about whether or not you want to stay with someone like this. You can\u2019t trust him not to do this again.

But we trust each other and I\u2019m not a creep so\u2026they are just therapeutic procedures as far as I\u2019m concerned.",

After the initial \"yup, that's a penis\" moment you really don't care, you're just focused on the fact that you suck at visually estimating proportions and ended up making the dude's torso look absurdly long.  And massage therapists aren't even seeing or touching intimate body parts, they're covered with a towel.\n\nI got a couple massages in Thailand and they were even more stringent - customers were given loose cotton clothes (kind of like scrubs) to change into before the massage therapist came in.  You're completely covered except for your arms, feet, and head.  Professional massages aren't sexual at all, it's more like getting a relaxing treatment at a spa like a facial or deep hair conditioning.",

When I get a Brazilian wax, the most commentary I got was \"sorry I had to do repeats in a couple spots, you have really thick hair roots.\"  They're not making comments about the aesthetics of my lady parts or talking in detail about sexual shit.  Same with massages.  They  might ask if there are any areas you would prefer they focus on, or any areas you're uncomfortable about them touching.  But it's like \"I have upper back pain, can you spend a little more time working on that region?\" or \"I just pulled a muscle there, can you use less pressure?\" It's all very professional and detached.

        "post-author": "SongbirdSpectrum",
        "text": "I'm struggling with figuring out how to start this, so I guess I'll just start with context. Obligatory apology for mobile and long post, I'll try to keep it semi brief but there's a lot. I, F28, have been friends with \"Blake\" 28M for about 10 years now. We met when I was traveling for a new job out of state, and I kid you not immediately became best friends in the week that I was there. Same interests, great energy and conversation, we just clicked. \n\nWe were friends for nearly 2 years before trying the dating thing. It lasted *3 months* (important), during which Blake did not treat me well due to unresolved issues from prior relationships. Before I could end it, he decided to end it himself as he had feelings for someone else. Fine with me, we were *clearly* better as friends. I took some space because he hadn't been treating me well, he got into therapy and apologized for being sh*tty, and was willing to put in the work to regain my trust for our friendship. Which he did, consistently, over the 8 years since.\n\nFast forward to now -- I'm now happily married to my wonderful husband Kam (28M, together for 6 years, married for ~2 years). Blake and I are still best friends; he and his ex after our brief dating stint broke up, and he is now with a wonderful woman \"Kaylie\" (21F) for almost 2 years now (started dating a few months before my wedding, this is important). Kaylie and I are also good friends, she's the sweetest person. Blake also lives in the same city as me now after his mother passed, having moved down here for a better support network; his girlfriend moved in about 9 months ago.\n\nIn the past 6 months or so, things have been strained with Blake. My husband is very introverted, and Blake started voicing frustration about his inability to be closer friends with Kam and feeling like he bothers Kam. He and I also started having weird tiffs (kind of subtle negs/belittling comments/etc). Then my husband and I came over to a game night for Blake's birthday 3 months ago, during which Blake picked fights with me about very weird things (for example my career path and how I'm going about it wrong, making comments like \"I guess if you want to stunt yourself in life, you can do it that way,\" etc). Both my Kam and I were caught very off guard, and after several attempts to shut it down, made excuses and headed home. \n\nLater, Blake proceeded to send me a text asking if I was okay bc the vibes felt off. To which I was like \"uh no kidding\", and explained my issue. He decided to reply with...an email (who uses email anymore???). 8 long paragraphs about how he felt he and his experience/knowledge was dismissed in our discussion, how he felt ganged up on when Kam would defend my side, and how he felt like he can't be himself around me and Kam anymore. He also made comments voicing that he didn't feel like he could trust me bc I tell Kam everything (not true, I always ask before sharing unless it's a danger or moral issue) and that he thinks I'm unhealthily codependent on Kam because whenever Blake and I hang out 1x1 I'm always calling to let Kam know how late I'll be out or check if I'm cool to pick up takeout (we're married with joint finances, sue me?).\n\nI replied trying to clarify my end as well as understand where the everloving hell this all was coming from, but no matter how many times I tried, we kept going in circles. The emailing back and forth, during which he demanded we not meet up till this was resolved, lasted till about 2 weeks ago, when I said I needed time to think about how to reply next. About a month ago I got into therapy bc it was seriously messing with my head and making me feel like I was a problem and like I couldn't talk to anyone about this bc we share much of our support system.\n\nI finally broke down to my sister when she came over to see why I hadn't been answering her (or really anyone, yay anxiety) lately. She is also friends with Blake through me. I let her read the emails, and she got pretty ticked on my behalf, and then proceeded to drop a helluva bombshell on me and Kam: *Blake is APPARENTLY \"still in love with me\" and hates Kam's guts.*\n\nApparently, when she drove to pick up Blake out of state for our wedding (he was a groomsman) he \"confided\" in her and her husband that he didn't agree with the wedding and wished I would break up with Kam and give him another chance. That we're soulmates and Kam isn't the one for me. Blake has heard me talk since day one about how happy Kam makes me and how safe and loved I feel with him. My sister shut it down, but, EVEN BETTER, Blake proceeded to do the same thing when she drove him *back home* after our wedding! He ended off saying he just needed some time, so my sister kept her mouth shut bc she knew that he's my best friend and hoped she could trust him to resolve it over time since he lived far away. \n\nBlake then moved near me about a year ago, and Kaylie moved in the August after. My husband's and my wedding anniversary is in October, and apparently Blake *called my sister's husband* to, AGAIN, confide that he's still in love with me and wishes I would divorce Kam bc he would be a better husband to me. While LIVING with Kaylie, who he's told me is his soulmate. This was about when all the stress started, so she never found a good moment to bring it up.\n\nAs if to ice the cake, Kaylie and I have been keeping up via text thru all this (again, we're friends). During the past few weeks, I learned some odd things:\n\n- Kaylie got new piercings, reportedly encouraged by Blake to do so bc \"she'd look so cute\": a double nose piercing and septum, which *possibly coincidentally* Blake took me to get as a post-wedding gift 2 years ago. \n\n- Blake apparently \"has beef with\" the month of August and so has decided their anniversary will be in *October*. The reason he gave was because \"it's spooky month\", but Kam and I started dating AND got married that month. I also, at my sister's prompt, went back and checked when Blake and I broke up -- August 2017. Again, *possibly coincidental*, but feels very odd as I don't know why else he would have an issue with that month.\n\nIt's also worth noting Blake had another relationship fall apart because the girl was outright convinced Blake was cheating on her with me to the point of blasting me for weeks as some homewrecker. Kam and I always chalked it up to her insecurity, but now I'm wondering if she was just watching Blake carry on some weird, one-sided emotional affair. I love my husband more than words can say, and he makes me happier than anyone I've ever met -- he's my ultimate best friend. Learning all this has made me feel so gross and like a horrible wife, though Kam has been wonderfully supportive and doesn't blame me at all.\n\nAll this to say, I'm ending our friendship, but have no clue how. I feel like I have to tell Kaylie as this has all happened during their relationship and living together and the woman deserves the world, but also recognize I have no real proof beyond spoken accounts besides the weird emails -- it sounds like some wild conspiracy theory or soap opera. My therapist is on vacation so I'm on my own after learning all this. I'm also realizing just how manipulative Blake has been for YEARS given this context, and already feel shaky about confronting him given my serious confrontation anxiety, which he knows about and could easily try to exploit. I'm realizing more and more that he has massive control issues that I dismissed as anxiety for years. The fact that he lives so close now fills me with dread rather than joy.\n\nI want to come out of this with no regrets, knowing I stood up for myself, and that I put a decisive end to this. I want Blake to know his actions and creepy ulterior motives are the reason our decade long friendship is dead. I've never ended a friendship myself (also a bit of an introvert), and this is basically friend-breakup on steroids. How do I break this lunacy to Kaylie in a way that sounds remotely believeable given the front Blake has built? I also would love some advice on how to go about telling Blake I know everything and we're absolutely done.",

He could attack you with your secrets, he could show up at your job, he could lie to your friend group about you.\n\n\nYour friend group will ask why you're avoiding him because he's going to inquire. Same answer, you're busy. After some time then you can tell them.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you don't have a doorbell camera I think you should get one.\u00a0",

Tell her that through this arguing and emails you've realized the friendship with him isn't healthy for you anymore. That he has unfair and one sided expectatio and has begun taking it out on Kam and you. Tell her that she deserves better than him, you would like to remain friends with only her if she would like, and that you think his feelings for you are inappropriate. Let her question him in details or work out what she finds is believable.\n\nAnd it's going to be sticky and uncomfortable. Friend break ups are HARD. Especially when they're so long. But defending your happy and supportive marriage is the right thing. Cutting off a rude and mean friend is necessary. \n\nYou aren't responsible for her feelings or his. Protect your peace.",

I also do not agree that you shouldn\u2019t be honest with your mutuals about Blake\u2019s abusive behavior. \n\nIf you want to stand up for yourself (I would want to, too) then I would draft him a text telling him that his feelings for you, emotional immaturity, and manipulation has made you realize that you are no longer willing or wanting to be friends with him. Friends don\u2019t treat other friends this way. Someone who is in love with someone  doesn\u2019t show \u201clove\u201d like this, because it\u2019s not love. It\u2019s just his own jealousy and control. Then I would tell him not to speak to you ever again, and if he tries to contact you, you will be enforcing strict consequences. Then block him immediately after sending. \n\nI would immediately tell Kaylie the reason you\u2019re ending your friendship with Blake (either right before or right after you tell him). Tell her she deserves better, but you will support her decision. Tell her you will no longer be spending any time with him at all, but also let her know that you will be taking a break from your friendship with her bc of how messy this all is. Be supportive, but enforce a strict boundary around hearing/talking/being around Blake. \n\nWhen other mutual friends ask you about Blake, TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED calmly and succinctly. We as a society need to stop protecting abusers, their behavior, and dignity. Actions have consequences! Why are they the only group of people this rule doesn\u2019t apply to? Blake will not protect you, in fact he will lie about what happened to all of your mutuals. If your friends don\u2019t believe you, that\u2019s on them, and will show you who they are. You have plenty of proof with those emails (so save them). \n\nBest of luck OP. Do what is best for you!",

Forever.\n\nIf you do wind up having to discuss why you've dropped him as a friend, I wouldn't make it about his unrequited feelings for you. Don't even mention that. Instead, frame it as his behavior about Kam.\n\nWhen people ask, say \"I found out he's been saying shit to people about Kam since we first got together\". You won't need to provide any proof because I guarantee you that if he's been bold enough to say all that to your own sister, he's complained about Kam to everyone else in your group, too, at some point or another. And either they don't agree with him and will understand why your loyalty is to your husband and you're cutting Blake off, or they do agree with Blake about Kam and you have a larger problem.\n\nYou're going to lose Kaylie as a friend in this, but that's just how it goes sometimes. You can't ice out one part of a couple and expect to stay friends with the other. If she asks why you haven't been in touch, say the same thing to her - \"I found out he's been saying awful things about Kam and our relationship as long as we've been together\". She'll understand because he has 100% bitched about Kam to her, too. You can tell her that you miss her as a friend and wish you could still be close, but you don't want her to have to pick sides.

He may tell you it's ok in order to not overlay you with guilt, but inwardly.......there's no way he was cool with you hanging out with blake. There's a 0.00% chance you would have been cool if he had a female best friend that he hung out with that he also had a sexual history with.\n\nDo better.....MUCH BETTER.\n\n  \n....this was a very frustrating post to read.",

                        "body": "So, I'm working right now and not replying to other comments till later due to time constraints, but thought some clarifications could do well given this comment. \n\n1) There is no sexual past. Blake and I did not sleep together, again this was only a 3 month relationship. Not everyone \"hooks up\", the most we ever did was kiss a few times upon visiting due to long distance, and again, this was 8 years ago.\n\n2) This isn't the only friend I've briefly dated that I'm still in touch with. Hell, Kam actually DOES have close friend that he also dated back when he was in college for about 6 months as well; she and I are reslly close as well, and Kam and I are godparents to her child. Genuinely, both of us are very secure in our relationship and don't take issue with it. We're also both into all genders, so opposite sex doesn't really mean much to us for friendships. It's all just people.\n\n3) My sister and I are in talks over this, I didn't feel it relevant to include in post but will here. I let her know how upset I was over her keeping this from me, and she broke down apologizing for it and recognizes she messed up. She also has severe anxiety, and, while it doesn't excuse it, thought it had resolved until the second time Blake reached out to her husband, during which time she was going through a lot herself personally, including the aftermath of a miscarriage. She was intending to tell me next we spoke around the time I fell off communicating from the stress of it all. We're working thru this separately.\n\nAs for your summary, having gotten a restraining order on a different ex, its not very easy to get one. I will definitely if I have to, but jumping straight to that doesn't seem feasible. The cop scare tactic is definitely not a bad idea to keep in my pocket though, thank you. \n\nAs for your frankly polarizing view on myself and my marriage, I didn't come here to ask for advice or opinions on my marriage. My husband has been amazing and very adamant that I know he is mad at Blake for being a creepy lying jerk and not me. He knows full well that I have eyes only for him and never once doubted that before nor after all this. You can think whatever you want of me or my marriage, but I did want to throw that out there. The feeling like a terrible wife I mentioned is because I feel like I've been blind this whole time, especially as I fully acknowledge how cliche this all sounds. Whether that's true or not, I know my marriage is solid and secure, and I in no way \"spat\" in anyone's face.",

And no, it's not \"different\".\n\nIn your heart of hearts you know you wouldn't feel good about that. Yet, every day you kept that best friend around you did that, that is  to say that you figuratively spit in your husband's face.\n\nYou didn't ask about it, but I call things out for wrong regardless if it's what you want or not. You're 28 years old and you've NEVER heard or had the thought to cross your mind that being friends with your prior bang buddy, essentially, might put you in a bad spot or caused your husband negative feelings? No way. That's not even close to a realistic situation.\n\nYou know you're wrong. You don't have to admit it to me, but one day you I hope you start taking accountability and not lean so much in a victim mentality of you being \"blind\". You had a role in this situation and it started because you didn't value your husband's feelings as strongly as you would want him to show you if the roles were reversed.\n\nYou might have been blind about blake's feelings, but you weren't blind about how it could have made your husband feel if you put yourself in his shoes.............and if you want to claim that you were blind by that too then that shows an alarming lack of care towards your husband's mental well-being.\n\nThat's the last I'm going to say about it.",

And there's two ways you're wrong.\n\nIn my younger and naive days, I thought like you and most people...that the only way it could be disrespectful is if it crossed romantic or lustful situations.\n\nI was engaged to a woman and had a female best friend. I thought it was fine like that. One day, my bf wanted to hang out solo with my fiancee. I dropped my fiancee off and didn't expect to get a call until several hours later to pick her up. Instead, I got a call about 30 minutes later to pick her up. I found out that they got into an argument with my best friend literally screaming in my fiancee's face \"You stole my best friend\".  The best friend never denied it.\n\nThere was absolutely no romantic feelings between us. I know that for certainty.\n\nWhat I learned is that a landmine is often \"priority\" in one's life. I've seen that happen MANY times. Shoot, even last night I heard from a guy of it happening to him as well. Even in this story there is the aspect that Blake had feelings for OP, BUT..........guess what? It includes him being jealous that Kam had a higher priority then him to OP.\n\nThe SECOND reason what it's wrong is that whenever you have a fight with your partner it's common to talk to friends, even your closest friend. You're at a vulnerable time and sharing vulnerable feelings. WHO are you going to resort to? Your best friend. In Op's case a best friend that not only do they have a sexual past BUT has been desiring an opportunity. Whether something happens in intimacy or not, it's still disrespectful to be vulnerable to your ex in that way.",

I think there\u2019s validity to that, especially in a situation like OP\u2019s where an ex is clearly wanting another shot, regardless of OP\u2019s status and feelings. \n\nWhat I\u2019m hearing is a difference in approach to relationships and their priority between you and I. My close relationships are all the same level. My partner is my important person, but they know and respect that I have other close relationships that are as deep and as vital to me as mine with them. And they have their own relationships like that too! And I think it\u2019s healthy and good, and it works for us.\n\nRelationships are ultimately damaged by what\u2019s not dealt with. If that\u2019s someone else\u2019s feelings, feelings for someone else, incompatibility with affection/standards/intimacy/sexual intimacy/etc. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to paint with such a broad brush, AND I see the validity in not airing private matters to an ex.",

She knew I was looking for a relationship with somebody....and the best friend was VERY, VERY bold....perhaps the most bold person I've ever known in my life, male or female. She didn't \"hmm and haaa\" about what she wanted. If she wanted a relationship or even to hook up you couldn't stop her from making an attempt.\n\nBUT....when somebody else took time away from what I was giving her....then it's a new ball game.\n\nFor you, I doubt those \"other close relationships\" have crossed a sexual line, otherwise I see no reason why you would omit saying it. A close friendship and a close \"friendship\" that you had sex with is as different as night is from the day. There's something there and it makes the \"vulnerable times\" more risky. Even if nothing happened, by human nature it's going to cause your partner to not brush it off.\n\nI would respect my partner to not even give her a second to think on it. It's not about her controlling me or her being insecure. Its respect to her and the relationship. \n\nNo matter how much I might be interested in how good the bbq wings are at a strip club, so I hear, I won't go in respect of my relationship........even if I refused to look at the strippers.",

        "text": "Together 8 years, married 7 years\n\nSo, I guess I just want to know if I'm crazy, how other men might plan their wife's birthday celebration given the conversation and if you'd be surprised at my reaction. \n\nAbout a month ago my husband (36M) asks me (32F) what I want to do for my birthday. I say I'd like to take a trip for the weekend. He specifically asks if I want a bunch of people involved or if I want it to be just the two of us. I tell him, just the two of us. My birthday though, almost always falls on Mother's Day weekend and for the past couple of years we've gone out of town and missed the holiday for my mom. So I say, maybe we can go to celebrate my birthday either the weekend before or after so we can spend Mother's Day with mom. \n\nCool, no problem. I text my mom a couple days later who says she has to work and can't do anything anyways. So I let him know the weekend is free for whatever he wants to plan. \n\nSo today, he asks if I'd like to know where we're going for my bday. The conversation goes:\n\nHusband: Do you want to know where we're going for your birthday?\n\nMe: Yes, I can start planning my outfits\n\nHusband: We're going to Alabama!\n\nMe: Really? Alabama? What's in Alabama?\n\nHusband: It's right on the border of GA/TN near Chattanooga \n\n(My aunt and uncle live near Chattanooga)\n\nMe: We're not going to visit aunt and uncle are we? \n\nHusband: No\n\nMe: Did you tell them we're coming? \n\nHim: Yea\n\nMe: Awww man I just wanted it to be the two of us\n\nHim: Well then you're really not going to like what I'm about to say. Your mom, little sister, older sister and nephew are also coming. \n\nMe: (A little speechless because I think he must be kidding but disappointment growing in my voice) But I thought we were going away, just the two of us. \n\nThis then becomes an exchange of him telling me I'm ungrateful, how hard he worked to plan all this and that he thought I'd want to spend mothers day and my birthday all together as a family and me trying to explain my reaction based on prior conversations, my expectations being based on what we talked about previously  and truly being impressed that he could get my family together for this. \n\nWe hung up suddenly because he had to go. I felt bad, I could hear the hurt in his voice because he thought he was giving me what I wanted, but I just don't understand how when I thought I made it pretty clear. \n\nSo back to the questions up top. Would you be surprised at my reaction given the conversations prior? Am I ungrateful? Am I justified in being disappointed? How would you all have gone about plans with the conversations that were had? ",

In healthy functional relationship you are able to tell your spouse you are disappointed in what they did. You do not have to lie and treat him like a fucking toddler because his *wittle baby ego got an owie.* **HE** needs to suck it the fuck and fix it, not her. \n\nPlease leave all of humanity alone and stop giving relationship advice to literally anyone. Just because you\u2019re happy to take care of a 40 year old man baby doesn\u2019t mean the rest of the world should. It\u2019s not wrong to expect your husband to act like an adult.",

                                "body": "If you\u2019re already blue in the face from trying to address this then I think you know what the next steps are, it\u2019s just hard to admit and even harder to do. I get it tho. If you\u2019ve explained and begged and cried and tried then you know he\u2019s not going to change because he doesn\u2019t want to change, he doesn\u2019t see an issue with what he\u2019s doing or you\u2019re not worth the effort as far as he\u2019s concerned. Am I correct in assuming any display of disappointment ((like this OP))  is met with how ungrateful you are for not appreciating his half assed \u201cefforts\u201d, probably because far too many people in his life have allowed him to act this way and praised him for \u201ctrying\u201d like he\u2019s a toddler. So\u2026..\n\nStep 1 \u2014 STOP doing more for him than he does for you. No more parties. No more gifts. No more surprises. No more nothing. Whatever he got you for your last gift event that\u2019s what he gets for the next gift event. It\u2019s beyond time to match his energy. \n\nStep 2 \u2014 decide if this is how you want to live the rest of your life. I wouldn\u2019t personally but I also understanding ending relationships isn\u2019t easy and sometimes it\u2019s not worth ending it over, that is everyone\u2019s very personal decision. I cannot possibly decide for *you* what your line in the sand is nor can I tell you that it\u2019s wrong \u2014except for blatant physical/emotional/psychological/verbal abuse. So you need to be real honest with what you can **HAPPILY** live with and without. **Happily** being the key word here. If it breeds resentment and makes you into a miserable, sad, angry person, that is definitely not a thing you can live with. For example, my husband is the absolute WORST at cleaning his shit up. I cannot tolerate it for many reasons. But it\u2019s not a deal breaker. I ***can*** live with his clothes on the floor on *his* side of the bed, I *can* live with having to tell him to clean this shit up. It\u2019s not making me angry or miserable and I am capable of ignoring it. Whereas my ex-husband was the absolute fucking worst with money that I\u2019ve ever dealt with. I\u2019m sure many could deal with putting their husband on a cash allowance, managing all the finances and taking away credit and debit cards. It\u2019s even ideal for some people. I am not one of those people.  I tried, it worked as long as I was willing to pay the bills, to make the budget, give him the money and we weren\u2019t bankrupt but holy hell, the resentment it built in me to not be able to rely on that fucking man to just drop off the goddamn rent check. There were obviously more issues but that was one of the more benign ones that not everyone would have a problem with, but it really killed my soul and made me hate him. I was pissed because I should be able to send my husband to the store for 1 thing we absolutely could afford and not be scared he put the account into the negative, it really was that bad. That was a basic foundational respect and trust thing that he could not fucking manage and I could not be happy in a relationship like that. \n\nNow, If you\u2019re not ready to end the relationship or not able to live with this issue and you want to keep trying to understand you still have to do step one. You have to match his effort. I know it feels petty, like you\u2019re punishing him, he might even say that you are, but that\u2019s not true. It\u2019s not punishment to treat someone in the *exact* manner they are treating you, it\u2019s a last ditch effort demonstration. You\u2019ve always tried talking to him about it now it\u2019s time to show him what this feels like. Ideally he understands what he\u2019s been doing, how shitty it feels and adjusts himself, why some grown ass adults need to be taught like children I will never understand. You can tell them all day long \u201c\u201dthat hurts me, please stop\u201d\u201d and they just don\u2019t gaf or they argue on how your feelings are actually wrong in some way, you\u2019re \u201coverreacting\u201d or \u201cbeing sensitive\u201d but then you do it to them and they get hurt or mad about it, obviously, and they learn or, they don\u2019t. When they don\u2019t is when you have a serious problem. His reaction to realizing that you are now treating him exactly as ***he*** treats *you* will tell you a whole hell of a lot and you need to pay attention to that more than anything else. Someone who is willing to treat you in a manner they will not tolerate being treated as, is not a good or safe person. That is a person who thinks you are less than they are, that you are deserving of lesser treatment they would **never** subject themselves to, that is not a **safe** relationship. \n\nThat\u2019s the broad strokes. Obviously every situation is different so if you\u2019ve got a specific scenario or situation or question I would be happy to try and be more specific in my advice for you.",

When you do something wrong and are rightly confronted about it is your response \u201c\u201dyou do it too!!\u201d\u201d What about when *you* are the one done wrong, and let\u2019s say it\u2019s a recurring thing they have subjected you to, do you enjoy when that person chooses that moment to let you know that one time two years ago you did that to them?? Or does it maybe feel invalidating and like they\u2019re trying to justify the clearly wrong behavior you didn\u2019t appreciate that hurt you?? How about the any number of posts talking about women as a monolith? How horrible, shallow and mean women are. Do you pop up on those posts and let them know \u201c\u201dhey men do this too. Actually men are probably worse about this than women are\u201d\u201d. Or is it only when **common behavior** amongst men is being mentioned that you just can\u2019t help but say \u2018women do it too!\u201d\u201d  ***That is why you\u2019re being downvoted.***\n\nEverything can literally apply to any person of any demographic, a child knows that. There are still very much different expectations and tolerance of men and women in society. There are absolutely things that men do more than women and expectations of women that do not exist for men. So to actually assert that ***this*** particular issue is not a problem far more prevalent in men\u2019s behavior is ridiculous and problematic and shows are shocking lack of awareness. This overwhelming need of men to \u201c\u201dbut women also!!!\u201d\u201d Or \u201cNot all men\u201d\u201d completely ignores and invalidates the actual issues, which of course is the goal of deflection. When you can\u2019t even admit that a problem exists, you damn sure can\u2019t be part of the solution. \n\nMen are not held to the same standard for planning and gift giving as women are and that\u2019s not even remotely debatable. The men, particularly married men, who take on the bulk of event planning and gift giving for their immediate and extended families is an absolute minority and I don\u2019t know how anyone could say otherwise. The gifts and parties men *receive* in comparison to the gifts and parties men *plan and give* is **staggering**. It\u2019s not a minor difference, or something so common it\u2019s not even worth mentioning. There is an absolute chasm between what is expected and tolerated of men and women in this department. Not knowing this fact of reality is either willful ignorance, not paying attention or a desire to maintain the status quo. \n\nReddit is filled with hundreds, maybe even thousands, of examples of ***this. exact. problem.*** for every 1 example of a woman acting like this there\u2019s 20 examples of men. I don\u2019t know why it is such a problem for men to admit that there are problematic behaviors within the male community, particularly since those same men are the very first and loudest to condemn all women any chance they get, over boogeyman issues that don\u2019t actually exist en masse no less. \n\n**That is why you are being downvoted.**",

Just think of it in sequence. He asks for suggestions and OP says a getaway, just the two of us. Then OP says \"oh but I don't want to miss Mother's Day so maybe any other weekend but that.\" So now he has two things living side-by-side in his head. Wife wants a trip. Wife doesn't want to shun her mom on Mother's Day. Cool.\n\nThen OP comes back and says oh mom has to work on the Mother's Day weekend anyway. So I guess any weekend is free including my actual birthday weekend. Op's husband now thinks dang, OP really wanted to do something for mom, maybe I can make this all work together. And then his brain just ran away with it.\n\nI'm not excusing him. I think it's nebulous enough that he should've asked even if he thought he was coming up with a great idea. He could've easily said hey now that we know that mom doesn't get a Mother's Day celebration this year, should we do something for the whole family that will let her feel celebrated? So he's not off the hook  But I do recognize the runaway train thought pattern and can say unequivocally that it isn't always bad intent, or even thoughtlessness. Not even man-brain (I'm a woman).\n\nIt still does need to be reeled in though! If I'm anywhere near on the Mark, I think OP and her husband should talk, discuss this calmly, and pick another birthday celebration\u2026 For two!",

So like, sure maybe he didn\u2019t maliciously get the family together to ruin OPs bday, but he also did not do good on birthday points.

I know it's not what you wanted, but I think he thought it was going to be a great idea for you. As an outsider I really see a guy with the best of intentions here, especially given all of the planning and coordinating with your family members that went into this. I don't see some lackadaisical guy who is not paying attention to his partner's wants and needs, someone who just threw something together without giving any thought to who you are and what you are like. We don't always get it right in relationships, but we are so lucky when we have partners who try this hard. It was a swing and a miss, that's all.",

She is looking forward to seeing her family on Mother's Day, etc. However she does feel that he missed the part where she wanted to spend her birthday just the 2 of them, and that is because she loves him and wants some time to disconnect from work and spend quality time together. Maybe there is an option for some private time together during this getaway, or for another trip alone, whatever.\n\nMy point is that we are not perfect. We try, and sometimes we fuck up. For a relationship to work we need to give our partner the benefit of the doubt. It was not his intention to disregard her wishes and book whatever the fuck he wanted, just to be selfish or lazy. He thought he was doing what she would like. He fucked up. Her feelings were hurt. She needs to realize that he didn't mean to hurt her feelings. When she reacted to the trip, his feelings were hurt. She didn't mean to hurt his feelings either. They both just need to give each other the benefit of the doubt.",

It felt like your comments were to point out he didn't mess up that bad and she shouldn't be upset, or if she is upset she should express her disappointment in away that he doesn't know she's upset.

By doing this, your partner created expectations for birthday plans. You have every right to be upset when your wishes were completely disregarded. \n\nSure your partner can be upset you\u2019re not happy or excited for what they plan. However, they should be willing to do some reflection on how they could have been a better partner or listened. They should take some accountability of disregarding your wants. Two things can be true at the same time aka your partner upset and take accountability for not listening. \n\nFor my 30th, I communicated that all I wanted was apple picking with my family and a specific cake. My birthday is in the fall and my family consists of 8 ppl including myself. At the time I was really struggling with my mental health, which my family knew. They decided to throw a surprise party (I HATE surprises) with 50+ ppl. I spent the party in a panic attack then broke down crying for 3 hours afterwards from the trauma of it all. But I was labeled ungrateful. Fuck that",

When he asked me what I wanted for my 40th, I told him I wanted a big party as well, but a surprise as his was originally intended. He offered to plan it entirely. As the months passed, I gave him some ideas on what I would like and offered to send a guest list. He said he'd pull it from FB, and he had it. As we got closer to my birthday, I realized nothing was happening. I didn't say anything because he said he had it, and maybe he was sneaky enough to hide it from me. The weekends before, during, and after my birthday I kept waiting for a surprise. I finally accepted that no big party was happening. \n\nA few weeks later, we had a big family get-together, and he pulled me aside at one point. My best friend had come to visit and that was my big birthday surprise. He was over the moon about it because we hadn't seen each other in a while, and he accomplished our get-together. \n\nI didn't say anything at the time. I was absolutely devastated. It was a few years later before we discussed it again, and I let him know how hurt I was. He thought he had done a great thing, and he did, but it wasn't what I wanted. We talked it all out and I decided my 50th would be the big party I wanted, but I'd be doing the planning. \ud83e\udd23 It was a minor disappointment in an otherwise happy marriage.

You aren't. There are only 2 ways he could've genuinely thought he was giving you what you wanted, and neither are flattering.\n\nEither (1) he didn't bother to pay attention to anything you said, or (2) he heard you clearly say what you wanted but decided you were too silly to make the right choice and his choice/preference was obviously superior.\n\nSo either he hears static when you speak to him or he expects his feelings to always be right/best compared to yours. Both bad. Neither your fault. If how you recounted events here is true, then you couldn't have been more clear. He either didn't pay attention or actively chose to disregard your wants. Either way, quite frankly he has NO right to be hurt. You do though. He better be cancelling those plans and making new ones immediately. Pay attention to the fact that his immediate response was to blame you for his mistake. Not to apologise. Not to jump straight into \"how can I fix it\" mode. To make you feel guilty enough that he wouldn't have to make any effort to fix it. Is that a pattern?",

No wonder you're hurt. \n\nI'm not sure that a weekend away together in addition to this will work, as your husband still doesn't seem to grasp that he messed up by springing this unwanted trip on you. When you didn't react as he expected, with cartwheels and joy, he got angry at you. This may not be about the Iranian yogurt. Please talk it over with him when you can do it in person, calmly, and ask why he thought this was a good idea. Based on past birthdays, it sounds like he can hear you, so what's different about this situation? Why did he ignore that you said, do the opposite, then get frustrated and call you ungrateful?",

So I think he only half heard what you said and jumbled up your comments about birthday and Mother\u2019s Day because he was not paying attention. Enjoy the Mother\u2019s Day weekend but let him know you still want to celebrate your birthday with just the two of you. If he says no, you have bigger problems.",

        "text": "Thanks for the check of reality from the last post, I feel like such a bad husband while writing this because, like everyone noticed except me my wife wanted to take her life, I feel like I failed her on so many levels.\n\nLike everyone said I asked upfront, in I woke up early and made her favorite breakfast to have the conversation, in the middle of the breakfast I asked her and she just broke up crying and whining, she just screamed about her not wanting to pass for grieving someone again and losing all that she loved, that all the women she knew in her gardening stuff have loss so many persons, their partners, their parents, their friends, and she couldn't see herself passing from all that over and over for the rest of her life, that she didn't like our apartment anymore, that even the cats reminded her of our baby boy, that she couldn't do it.\n\nI felt so pathetic after that, cuz I thought that after a year those thoughts would go away, or at least didn't affect her so much, but it does, after that, I held her for a while and I cried with her, she even told me that when she looks at the cats she just can remember how they used to take naps with our baby and that break me so many levels.\n\nOn Sundays, my in-laws have a family lunch so I talk to them, so we have a kind of intervention with my wife, I would accept the fact that if she wants to get a divorce I will give her some space, but it would be progressive I will spend time with her if she wants and like when we just los out baby boy she would be sleeping on her parent's house so she wouldn't be around all that reminds her of our baby.\n\nToday in the early morning I took all my days off so I will be off for this week, she went for an emergency therapy session, and the therapist recommended leaving my wife in a 24-hour guard but my wife started to have a horrible breakdown so my mother-in-law, the therapists and me decided that my wife would have to stay with intense therapy and under strict vigilance until she agrees to internalize or get better.\n\nAnd in the afternoon when she was more calm asked me to buy her a bunch of chocolate eggs, bags, and things to decorate, so she started to make a bunch of bags with easter eggs with beautiful decorations, she said that her plan gave them, so now I'm contacting all her friends that work with the public so she can be allowed to give those eggs to someone, just two of her friends have answered so she already would give those to children and older people, I hope she would have a good time.\n\nI just came from leaving her in her parent's house and I never feel so broke since we lost our baby boy, and her cats have been missing her too because they never liked me that much but they have been scratching their heads against my legs since I come back, I guess that this would be our new normality.\n\nTomorrow after or before the eggs I will go and find someone that the therapists recommended that could be with her for the day to keep an eye on her while my mother-in-law or I do housework or have to sleep and be able to manage her if she has another breakdown \n\nThanks again everyone for the wake-up call, I cannot even put into words how grateful I am for making me give my wife the help she needed.",

But kept me busy. Then the depression hit. For a long time. Then one day it hit me. My daughter wouldn\u2019t want me doing this to myself. I wanted to make her proud.

It sounds like you're going to be there often this week, and that is good. Make sure to always talk about what you're going to bring her or tell her about on your next visit (like \"I'll bring you some coffee from x\", or something small like \"I saw a flower on the way here, I'll take a photo to show you tomorrow\",) so it is in her head that you will be coming back and expecting to see her.\n\nI wish you very best of luck.",

I think anyone in your situation could have missed this. \n\nSecond, you were still ultimately the person who took action to get this diagnosed, which is the first step to making it better. You realized *something* was wrong and were humble enough to ask other people for advice. It was your action to realize this didn\u2019t make sense and ask for help that got the ball rolling on fixing this. \n\nThird, a good exercise is to say \u201cwould I blame a friend\u201d for doing what you\u2019ve done in this situation.  We can be our own worst critics, and think about what you\u2019d say to a friend going through what you\u2019ve been through. I think you would analyze them as a good husband doing their best, albeit without all the answers. And you\u2019re clearly doing that. \n\nMy heart goes out to you and your wife.

But I was determined to be open-minded since it's only been two dates and maybe he could really be a great guy underneath all the blandness. Plus, I have found plenty of people more physically attractive once I get emotionally attracted to them. \n\nToday he kept bragging about how he could land plenty of younger girls if he tried and how I wasn't pretty or young (he is six years my senior), but have a good personality compared to \"them flirty girls\". Also he kept criticizing my job for not being \"stable\". He's a public servant while I work corporate, and have a comfortable and promising position. \n\nI don't like being talked to like this. But my friends were saying that maybe he was too nervous and was trying to establish his worth by putting me down. Do you think it's worth my time to excuse this behavior and agree for a third date?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the advice. I did ditch him. \nThe reason why I was even dating the guy is that I am from a very conservative culture and this guy was thrown my way by my family who is nagging me a lot about my single status.

So let\u2019s just go with the \u2018innocent until proven guilty\u2019 theory and for arguments sake say that your bf is NOT cheating but maybe this co-worker is coming on to him, and this can be explained away and with proof.  If you walk away without giving your bf an opportunity to explain the situation he might resent that fact.  And ultimately resent you for the snooping (phone) and breakdown of trust and communication. \n\nHave you two ever faced this sort of challenge before?  Has there been infidelity in your relationship?  Do you know this co-worker?   I ask these questions because I too am a firm believer in \u2018go with your gut\u2019 and your gut told you to check his phone.  And although what you found on his phone was indeed nauseating, it isn\u2019t exactly concrete evidence of cheating.  Gross misconduct, absolutely, but not full blown cheating (imo).  And if you make a serious accusation and decide for the both of you that the relationship is over then you just need to be prepared that if you are wrong that there maybe be no turning back.  That\u2019s my only word of caution.  However, you may not be able to stomach what he has to say if you confront him\u2026. that\u2019s a real consideration.  \n\nNgl, the messages between your bf and the co-worker don\u2019t sound great.  And my mind would go where yours, and everyone else\u2019s, did.  But sometimes things aren\u2019t what they appear to be.  And because of fear, vulnerability, humiliation and a while bunch of other stuff, we sometimes make decisions that might not best serve us.

There could possibly be an innocent explanation for the message exchange.

It\u2019s a cautionary warning.\n\nOf course the flip side of that is, and to your point, that if anyone finds themselves in a position such as this, they need to make decisions that best suit them.  If they deduce that their partners actions are unforgivable and are confident in a decision to leave a relationship, then have at it; leave without regrets or regard for resentment.  You\u2019re right\u2026not her problem anymore!",

I think not.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe way he responded gives him plausible deniability. He could argue that the way he worded his response was meant to portray shock and disillusionment and that the archiving of the chat was to disengage from it while preserving it in case. This would make sense if the woman was intimidating him via his job, physically, socially, etc - that does happen. It's statistically unlikely for that to be the case, though. More likely if he is subordinate to her at work or if she is well-connected/powerful locally: both of those scenarios would make it more likely that he's scared to reject her outright.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nI would be conflicted on how to approach this because I can be persuaded to give chances where I shouldn't.

I'd most likely still leave. I don't think it's fair to bring those kinds of issues into a relationship and then expect one's partner to stand by as the cheater rehabilitates themselves. If a relationship is really good and truly meant to be I feel like it will come back around once the cheater has done the personal work they need to do.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAll in all.... to ME, very much seems like you're being cheated on. The messages are very forward and the reaction he provided is kinda sickly. You gotta live your life in a way that's good for you so do whatever you need to do in order to honour yourself.\u00a0",

        "post-author": "Significant-Time-533",
        "text": "Hey everyone , I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost a year now, and although a lot of things are great between us, there are also some stuff that really bother me and are starting to feel like red flags. I\u2019m unsure if I should proceed with the relationship under the \u201crules\u201d he\u2019s been enforcing or if i can keep tolerating his weird opinions.\n\nOne of the biggest issues is that he asked me to cut off my boy best friend of over four years. (The only reason he asked me to do that though is because he found an album on my phone where I had saved a bunch of photos, videos, and messages from our chats, nothing inappropriate, just A LOT of memories, he got the wrong idea and felt uncomfortable, so he told me I had to at least stop talking to him.)\n\nAnother thing that really gets to me is that he doesn\u2019t let me wear short skirts anymore, even if I wear safety shorts underneath. He said he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want me to look like a whore.\u201d We also had a big argument over what swimsuit I should wear this summer. He\u2019s obviouslu against bikinis, and even some swimdresses if they show cleavage or are too short. According to him, it\u2019s not safe for me to get too much male attention, especially if I\u2019m out alone. That idea has only come up more recently,I was \u201callowed\u201d to wear skirts for the first nine months of our relationship, but then he changed his mind after I broke his trust on multiple occasions, and if I hadn\u2019t, then he wouldn\u2019t have had to take that back or make such strict rules.\n\nHe also demands that I\u2019m home before 8:30 p.m.\n I live in a city and have a one-hour ride home (using public transport). Most of the time i come back from a day with my friends sooner than he tells me to , and he said he felt disrespected that i always do the same mistake and that it was way too risky for me to travel that late by myself (we both have a bad experience with \"weird\" people in my city)\n\nHe checks my phone sometimes. he doesn\u2019t read anything, but he did once ask me to show him the TikToks my friend was sending, because I sent him a video about some gym guy humbling another. It was a harmless (?) meme, but he still felt uncomfortable that she sent me a video of a shirtless guy and thought that maybe she sends me stuff like that often.\n\nHe also told me I can\u2019t have any group of friends if there are males involved, and that I shouldn\u2019t have any close friendly communication with guys at all.\n\nOn top of that, he regularly calls women \u201cwhores\u201d online for posting gym pictures and even leaves comments under their videos. He has some really misogynistic opinions, and while he\u2019s always ready with arguments to support them, its still not something im comfortable with.\n\nI want to also however mention the good side as well, he has told me that once we move in together, he\u2019ll take care of everything \u2014 all expenses, supporting me through school, helping me, and making sure I have everything I need. And right now, he is very supportive in many ways. Our communication is usually really good, and I do enjoy being with him. But these rules and the controlling behavior are really putting me off, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something I can accept for the rest of my life.\n\nSShould i break up with him?",

You'll wake up and you'll be 40 years old and stuck, desperate and hopeless. You can prevent that by simply changing the course of things *today*. Red flags are almost always visible and often ignored. Don't do that. You've got the information already - at just 21 years old, he's already showing major controlling tendencies.

A good boundary would be setting consequences for certain behaviour \"if you flirt with someone else, I am going to break up with you.\" No guilt trip, no shaming, just a clear calm consequence.\n\n A bad boundary is an ultimatum or demand. Take your pick of the plethora of bad boundaries in the OP. An ultimatum tries to force a behavior change through fear, whereas a good boundary respects that the other person still has a choice. \n\nThe key difference here is that good boundaries come from self-respect. Basically, not letting the other person disrespect you through bad behaviour.\n\n Bad boundaries stem from insecurity or a desire for control.",

Let's say with clothing, it is not your choice what someone else wears. However, if your partner is practically naked at a party, some may find that disrespectful. Would you say this is more likely an insecurity because your partner isn't interacting inappropriately with someone else whereas in the flirting example, there is an actual exchange that your partner is participating in?",

A lot of \"your behavior\" is inexperience.\n \nLet me tell you that a dude just like him almost starved me and choked me to death. I was close to your age. I was 19.\n\n It didn't start like a horror show. It started with him being a very charming gentleman. Then, my story sounded similar to yours. In fact, I don't think he was as bad as yours before moving in. Then it got worse and worse. Next thing you know, I'm sick with pneumonia and not allowed to go to the doctor even though I had free insurance. He refused to keep food in the house. He refused to let me drive anywhere. He watched who I talked to and what I said. He wasn't physical. Just a verbally abusive asshole. Next thing you know, he's SAing me, and once when he slung a drawer over our infant daughters head and I got brave enough to get in his face and tell him to calm down, he choked me out.\n\n I had to flee in the middle of the night with my kid while he was asleep. I'm lucky I'm not dead. I've heard dozens of stories from other women, and the stories are all so similar. \n\nYou have an entire life ahead of you. Don't let already sinking a year into a dickwad end up being an excuse to stay and you end up with a life of ptsd. You can never fix them. It never gets better. Go be young and single. Have some fun.

What you\u2019re describing is not a healthy relationship with \u201crules\u201d\u2014it\u2019s a dynamic built on control, fear, and manipulation, not love or safety.\n\nAs a certified narcissistic abuse relationship recovery coach, I see stories like yours every day. Patterns like:\n\t\u2022\tBeing isolated from friends (especially male friends)\n\t\u2022\tClothing being policed under the guise of \u201cprotecting\u201d you\n\t\u2022\tBeing \u201callowed\u201d to do certain things until his mind changes\n\t\u2022\tAccusations and guilt-tripping about harmless memories or videos\n\t\u2022\tExtreme jealousy disguised as care\n\t\u2022\tName-calling and misogynistic language\n\nThese are red flags of emotional and psychological abuse. The fact that he follows up this control with promises to \u201ctake care of you\u201d is another layer of manipulation\u2014designed to keep you dependent on him and confused about whether you\u2019re the problem (you\u2019re not).\n\nYou\u2019re asking if you should break up with him, but it sounds like you already know deep down that this doesn\u2019t feel right. You\u2019re not crazy for questioning it. And you don\u2019t need to wait until it escalates to something worse to justify leaving.\n\nYou deserve freedom, peace, and love without control.\n\nIf you want guidance, support, or just someone who gets it\u2014I\u2019m here.\nYou can find free resources and connect with me at www.howtoloveabatteredwoman.com.",

You know you would never betray his trust. But that won\u2019t matter to him because he will continue to pressure you, making every public outing feel like a minefield. You\u2019ll find yourself silenced, exhausted, and isolated, simply trying to avoid conflict.\n\nPlease, believe me when I say: you deserve better. You deserve to breathe, to live freely, to make your own choices without fear of constant surveillance and control. I cannot emphasize this enough: Leave this relationship!!

I have a 20 year old daughter and would give her the same advice. Your partner should never set rules for you, especially who you are friends with, a curfew, what you should wear, etc. He is controlling you, and it will get worse. Please save yourself and break up with him before he totally isolates you. AND don't have unprotected sex, condoms aren't enough.

Please read that book before you date again. \n\nYou\u2019re a smart girl and you deserve to be respected by your partner. I wish you the very best and hope what I\u2019ve said resonates with you.",

Without financial independence you're beholden to him, and it's something he can use to guilt you (\"How dare you wear clothes I don't like - I pay all the bills!\")\n\nYou basically wrote a whole essay on How This Guy is the Worst but the financial aspect jumped out at me.",

There's nothing wrong with not having experiences to learn from. That comes with age. Take this as a lesson. \n\nIf you're uncomfortable with what he's doing now, it's only going to get worse when he runs your life. \n\nLet's say you allow this to continue and stay with him. Moving in together will push you off a cliff. He'll pay for everything and \"support you,\" is a false sense of security. He's going to dangle that in your face your whole relationship. His \"rules\" are going to get worse. You'll be isolated from anyone and everyone. Most likely beaten and sexually assaulted with the obvious trauma that's going to come with that. \n\nWe're not saying these things to be rude internet strangers.

                "body": "the title told me enough to know you should dump him but every line of the post only made my terror and heartbreak for you worse. you are in an abusive relationship with a genuine predator. you say you've been together a year? a 20yo has no business with a 17yo. at 20, i couldn't have even imagined dating an 18yo high school senior. an almost-19yo college freshman would have been pushing my limits. by 21, even 19 would have felt wrong. you get so much adult experience and maturity in those first years out of high school, and while even a 21yo is still far from being as mature as, say, a 30yo, they're in a drastically different life stage. at 21, i couldn't even have real friendships with 18yos because they just felt like kids to me. dating one would have been unthinkable.\n\neven what you talk about as the \"good parts\" contains what is, in combination with everything else in this post, a huge red flag - his desire to make you a \"kept woman,\" so to speak. there's a huge difference between a man who is willing to do whatever he can to take care of you in an equal relationship, knowing you would do the same for him if it came to it, and a man whose goal is to make you financially dependent on him.\n\nnotice the ways his \"rules\" for you (which is already a problem - he's your boyfriend, not your father. and i promise he'd react poorly if you tried to put in place similarly restrictive \"rules\" for him) have already slowly gotten stricter with time in not even a year together. you already (understandably!!!) find your current situation suffocating and overly restrictive? that cage he's constructed around you will only continue to shrink for the rest of your life if you stay with him. it's likely someday he'll become violent and spiteful whenever you upset him in order to keep you in control. today it's only male friends you \"aren't allowed\" to have - slowly it will become the female ones who decides are threatening, one by one, until you have only him. someday it will become your family too. \n\nhe doesnt want an equal partner to love and spend his life with. he wants a subservient wife to control, to bend to his will, to own. those misogynistic beliefs illustrate that. and there's a reason he chose a 17yo girl instead of a 20yo woman - women his age have the benefit of a little more life and relationship experience, and to be blunt - they know better. they know to steer clear of men like him. because to some degree, they've been where you are now with another guy, their own age or otherwise, and they know the signs. if they haven't, they've loved someone who has.\n\nplease please please, run far away from this man. block him everywhere and never look back. there is a wide world out there of real, healthy, respectful love for you to find. never give any man this kind of control over you, because the men worthy of your love and loyalty would never want it. i would never want to control my girlfriend like this, nor has she ever tried to control me like this in 11 years together. this isn't love. im so sorry this awful man has convinced you otherwise and treated you this way. you deserve real, healthy love.",

You stated he plans to 'take care of you' by covering college, rent, etc. He's doing this to make you dependent on him so it's harder to leave. In the future, he's going to hold this stuff over your head to show all the things he's done for you to inspire guilt in you. He's telling you his plans to take complete control over your life.\n\nI know all of this because I've lived it.

Told me he didn't like me going to FEMALE friends parties without him there because other men may be there who would try to take advantage of me. \n\nAt the time, I felt special and loved and \"protected\". I thought he wanted to keep me all to himself because I was so precious to him. I thought he was \"possessive\" and sexy like you read about those alpha males with their females.\n\nIt got tiring for me though, all the constraints. When I began to question them - he got angry. Tried to argue with him. It began to feel like he just didn't trust me and I hadn't done anything to warrant this distrust. Even though he claimed he trusted me, just not other men. \n\nEventually I realised it was all bullshit and just his deep insecurity that meant he tried to control my every move. I argued him with him about attending my best friends girls get away - all girls for 5 nights away just spending wholesome time on a road trip. We were not even going to go clubbing or hit up beaches..it was a totally wholesome trip with just girls. He didn't want to let me go. Because I said I was going regardless, he attacked me. His true colours showed then.\n\nJust like my ex - your boyfriend is an abusive controller. The only reasons his true nature hasn't come to the surface- is because you have been obedient and compliant. The moment you demonstrate any independent thought to what he allows, he will hurt you. \n\nThink - do you want to live like this for the rest of your life? Do you want to be forever with someone who exerts this much control of your fashion choices and way you live your life? If the answer is no - break up! Don't waste anymore time with this insecure controlling loser!",

He wants to own you and treat you like property. He doesn\u2019t respect you or see you as an equal partner. He doesn\u2019t want you to succeed and will do anything to stop your success. \n\nMy advice: end your relationship and don\u2019t explain why. He will try to love bomb you and try to talk you out of it. You are not safe with him, trust me. Just tell him it\u2019s over and gray rock if he tries to engage. Do not engage with him. Tell your friend and family not to engage with him either in case he starts stalking you. Your safety is paramount. \n\nGood luck OP! \n\nAnd let us know how it went. We are all rooting for you!!!!

It\u2019s your choice, they need to choose to love you or leave you over it.

Eventually I couldn\u2019t go to work or school with out being accused of cheating.. or the store.. then I wasn\u2019t allowed to wear make up, and was afraid when my mom would text me or make a game sound because \u201cwho the fk is THAT? Your BOYFRIEND??\u201d Like shut up.. it\u2019s my mom\u2026 \n\nThen I was forced into horrible things that I didn\u2019t want to do because he made me feel ugly and worthless and I couldn\u2019t be myself, ever. He talked shit about women, but would cheat on me. He controlled what I wore, where I went, who I talk to, he controlled the finances and my car. I had lost everything. \nThen he took credit cards out in my name, on top of the ones I had and couldn\u2019t pay- in secret just to be able to buy shampoo, and other necessities. Couldn\u2019t ever buy new underwear because WHOS THAT FOR\n\ndid I mention that he further trapped me by getting me pregnant? Oh yeah, that too. I raised that baby and carried a household by myself with zero funds, zero friends, and zero family to support me while he went to the bar and only came home when he couldn\u2019t find any \ud83d\udc31there. \n\nHe ruined my credit and all sense of worth. It has been four years since I left for the final time, but I spent way too much time thinking that if I just complied, he would be better. \n\nIt\u2019s not loyalty, or love, sweetie. It\u2019s fucking insanity and I wish I had so many people to tell me to run as fast as I could away from someone like this. This IS NOT love.

This book opened my eyes to how messed up the relationship I was in was and how much mistreatment I wasn\u2019t recognizing bc I was slowly conditioned into it. There is a free version of this book online if you Google it. This guy is *not* okay. \n\nYour boyfriend is controlling. He views you as his property, not as your own person. \n\nA partner does not have a right to:\n\n1. Control what you wear \n\n2. Dictate who you can and can\u2019t be friends with \n\n3.

I have several male friends that I\u2019ve made, my best friend being over a decade long friendship. My husband is secure enough to know that I love him, not the friend I had a shot with for 10+ years but never pursued, because we are just that, friends. Please leave, you\u2019re young, so many better and positive relationships are in your future. This guy needs to work on himself before he considers another relationship.\nAlso if I ever caught my husband commenting nasty things to women wearing what they want, I honestly think that\u2019d be a deal breaker. It shows how he really feels about our gender.",

After all, I would imagine that you have worn short skirts many times in the past and nothing bad has happened to you. Am I right? This rule is utter nonsense and only made due to his insecurities. He doesn't want you to attract the attention of any other men because he perceives it as a threat to him due to insecurity. Wouldn't you rather have a boyfriend who is happy to have all eyes on you when you enter the room because he feels proud that you choose to be with him? I know that I would. Instead, your boyfriend is so insecure that he wants you to feel shame and believe that you are, somehow betraying him by the manner in which you decide to dress yourself. \n\nI understand that you are very young, and this may be your first serious relationship, but true love doesn't include ridiculous expectations like what you describe. You deserve so much more, and no matter how hard you try to prove to him that you love only him, he will continue to gradually tighten the line you must tow in order to keep him happy. Eventually, it will become suffocating and impossible and will cause you to build resentment. You are just beginning to get a taste of what lies ahead of you if you continue in this relationship. \n\nThese arbitrary, double standard rules are absolutely a huge red flag.

Our communication is usually really good, and I do enjoy being with him. \n\nPretend your relationship is a sandwich. It\u2019s a really good sandwich made with high end ingredients- freshly baked bread, gourmet deli meats, succulent cheese, crunchy lettuce, and your favorite sauce. Just thinking about this sandwich gets your tummy grumbling it\u2019s so good. \n\nOne problem with the sandwich though: tucked delicately between two slices of deli meat is a small cat poop. *It doesn\u2019t matter how good the rest of the sandwich is*, the presence of *any* amount of poop turns the entire thing into a shit sandwich. Would you want to try your luck with a shit sandwich by blindly attempting to nibble around the poop, hoping you don\u2019t get a mouthful? No, of course not! You throw the entire thing out and find a new sandwich that has no poop in it. \n\nYour relationship is abusive. Your partner is a controlling abuser. **The good parts don\u2019t negate the abuse**. In an abusive relationship *the good parts are actually a part of the abuse*, they are an *intentional manipulation* on his part. The good times happen to give you hope during the bad times, they happen so you won\u2019t leave him. Please check out the healthy relationship quiz at [Love Is Respect](https://www.loveisrespect.org/quiz/is-your-relationship-healthy/), as well as the books [Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men](https://ia902200.us.archive.org/19/items/why-does-he-do-that-inside-the-minds-of-bancroft-lundy/Why%20Does%20He%20Do%20That__%20Inside%20the%20Minds%20of%20-%20Bancroft%2C%20Lundy.pdf) and [Should I Stay or Should I Go?](https://archive.org/details/LundyShouldIStayOrShouldIGo) (links are to free PDFs of the books).

As a bonus, you'll dress like he wants, eat what he wants you to eat, speak when he permits you to do so, and you'll care for him better than your mother cared for you. \n\nDo you need to be taken care of?

I was told what I could and could not wear.\n\n When I was pregnant with our second child I was not allowed to wear warm clothes because he didn't want to spend the money on maternity clothes that I might get too fat for. I was not allowed to wear a jacket. I was five months pregnant and only allowed to wear shorts, t-shirt and flip flops in winter in the snow! \n\nI ended up in the emergency room with pneumonia and because I was so sick, the baby got sick and died. \n\nYou might think he would never do that. Anyone who knows my ex, doesn't think so either. But the truth is, it happened. That wasn't even the only bad thing that happened but it is where controlling what you wear can lead. Leaving wasn't even an option for me. I had moved out of state for his job ( Army), didn't know anyone, wasn't allowed to leave the apartment, so I had no job and no money and no transportation. \n\nYou think it won't happen, but it starts like how you are experiencing it now.\n\nRUN!!",

I think you already know the answer to this, but girl, RUN for the hills. \n\nHe's trying to isolate and control you, and offering to pay for everything is a CLASSIC move for an abuser like this. It's not for selfless reasons. It's a way to gain ultimate control over you and have you completely dependent on him. If he has his way, he will by then have you so brainwashed, insecure, and manipulated into thinking you need him and can't do it without him. \n\nThe red flags are right there flashing in your face hun, don't question or excuse them! This man sounds dangerous, and I would be finding a safe way to cut all ties with him. Men like this don't get better. It WILL get worse. They also don't like losing control and can be most dangerous when someone tries to leave them. You know him best (what he's shown you, that is). Be honest with yourself and if there is any part of you that thinks he could become violent, then stay with a friend or family member if you have to, until you're confident he understands and respects that it's over and won't be showing up on your doorstep. \n\nDon't let the \"good side\" fool you. The majority of abusers have a charming and charismatic mask. That's how they get you where they want you. It takes time to work into someones psyche, so they'd never be able to keep someone around long enough to fall under their spell, if they showed you who they really were up front! \n\nWishing you all the best.

You are not his god damn property...unless you let yourself be. Here is an interesting thought exercise to ponder... Write a list of rules, restrictions, conditions, standards, whatever you want to call them, but in this case, make them about him. Now ask yourself, would he think this is fair now that the shoe is on the other foot? You are 18 and it's 2025. You have the choice not to put up with this garbage.

Him wanting to 'take care of everything' is a classic abuse tactic. Very easy to be the one in control when you make all the money and your girlfriend stays at home most of the time. Less coworkers=less people to tell you that you're being abused and taken advantage of. He will also push away your female friends (she's not good for you, I heard her talk behind your back, etc).\n\nHe will only become more controlling. He's already told you that he will, and he framed it as good news... he'll take care of anything, you just have to follow his rules. Will you be happy spending the rest of your life with a partner who doesn't see you as an equal and instead sees you as property that he owns? The sooner you get out, the easier it will be.

It's important to learn that the masses are often wrong, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. All these people know about him are the negatives you've listed here, and the brief bone you threw him at the end.\n\nI want to give my perspective as another guy who wants something in the vein of what your boyfriend does. I have no doubt that the rules he's placing on you stem from a good place, and were probably what he was exposed to growing up. He's older than you, sure, but he's still very young and likely hasn't had any time to assess whether the standards he was raised by are what he wants to strictly follow in a relationship. \n\nI'm giving him some slack because I have to follow up by saying that I think some of his boundaries are too much. Being home by 8:30, not participating in friend groups where men exist, and being unable to wear bikinis are things that you can't reasonably expect of a girl unless she wholeheartedly agrees with them already. That being said, I think there's room for discussion here if you're right that he's a good communicator. Unlike most of the other people here, I think this guy does genuinely care for you and will be receptive to your discomfort if you make him keenly aware of it. \n\nIf what you've said in the comments is true--that you share many other values that are important to you--then it's worth talking this out. If the only source of conflict in the relationship is his traditionalism, then it'd be silly to leave him without making an attempt to compromise. Stress the importance of this, though; you're willing to break up over it, so tell him that. If he still won't budge, then you've done your due diligence and can leave knowing that. \n\nEither way, best of luck to both of you.",

When I go out alone, he tells me to take care and not to go somewhere dangerous, and when we're together, I can simply ignore men who look at me and he'll take care of it. I won't stop being me for a relationship, I can tune down some of the things that are more outrageous out of respect but not to the point of censorship.\n\n He goes out sometimes and tells me he's going home late, and so do I. We both trust each other enough to know we can have spontaneous fun without having to automatically cheat or be promiscuous. Drinking, going out and having fun with your friends don't make you cheat, wanting to cheat makes you cheat. We don't go to the same places as we did out of respect, such as places known for being just for hookups (obviously), and we DO have boundaries over where we can go and what we can do, as any relationship should have, but it's not a \"go all out or stay home\" situation and it should never be. \n\n We have full access of each other's phones, but we don't mandate it and it came naturally out of trust. We both have nothing to hide and we both respect our privacy to know our limits. There's things that should be secret even for your partners, such as your best friend telling something personal such as trauma or lady problems. We don't go searching for signs and when we need to discuss personal issues with our friends we simply say that. \n\n I think most importantly, I've never had to run to his qualities to excuse his flaws. We're both flawed like any other person, and it never felt like we had to outweigh the issues or debate it. \n\n I'm not saying my relationship is the healthiest and the totem every other should follow, healthy relationships can look many different ways, and what works for us might not work for other couples, but the main thing is respect. We respect each other and respect our boundaries. We don't mandate things because we're both adults and equal. We don't have power over each other, we think alike and resolve our issues with dialogue and compromise. \n\n You're young, and there's no reason for you to settle for a manipulative person like him. It may sound cool to be the one who stays at home and doesn't have to work, who gets taken care of and is provided, but the truth is that it's not like that. When you take someone's financial autonomy like that, you take their ability to get away, to make decisions, to take care of themselves, to secure themselves and to make a plan. He's already showing you enormous bright signs of who he really is, and it'll just get worse, you don't need to sit and watch it happen. There's always someone else who's willing to work it out and be the person you need, and this guy is not it.",

Being bisexual does NOT keep you from having friends when you are in a relationship with someone. It just means you can't have close friends that are also sexually oriented in a way that you could date them. If I was gay, and I had a boyfriend, I wouldn't want my partner being super close to some other gay guy. It's just human nature. Sadly, our society is homophobic and so gay people tend to stick together and spend time together which I can imagine makes it so that cheating is probably super common in the gay community because of this.
