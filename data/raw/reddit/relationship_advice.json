        "text": "Tl; dr My brother berated my wedding choices, complained for months of how we do our wedding, insulted me and canceled last minute, did not even send me a Congrats message. Parents are hosting him for lunch. How do I navigate my relationship with my parents taking his side when I am so angry over this?\n\nEDIT TO ADD: You may wonder why I am choosing to cut contact with my brother over this and the truth is it\u2019s not just this. The last 5+ years he has been an emotionally abusive person who always picks fights and finds something to be unhappy about and critisize you. Every time we get together he shouts at my mother - if she hasn\u2019t cooked what he wanted (he never says in advance what he wants but it\u2019s never what\u2019s available), if she speaks too loundly, if she breathes wrong etc. He shouts at my father too. He\u2019s tried to be a bit more mild with me because I do not tolerate shouting. He gets into fights witb everyone over small things. He\u2019s told me he screams at his wife. He belittles our parents and they still tolerate him. I\u2019m very angry over this and really can\u2019t comprehend why he is being so horrible and they still adore him and defend him when he is being an ass with me too.\n\nEnd of edit\n\nI have another post in my profile which explains in detail what my brother did around my wedding and how he decided not to come. I will try the shorter version here.\n\nI got married last week to husband (38M). My brother has been difficult from the start. Ever since I told him about the upcoming wedding he has been critisizing me and berating our choices of venue, entertainment, people invited, location of the wedding and anything and everything. He even got so far as to question my clothing choice for the wedding day and my own choice of transportation for just myself and husband! \n\nHe tried to give me \u201cadvice\u201d (really, just critiques) of whom to invite and not to invite, berated me for inviting certain family members (that he is on good terms with), argued with me that my choice of wedding (cocktail reception after courthouse) is offensive (???!!) and so on. \n\nFour or five days before the wedding day he picked a fight with me about parking arrangements and asked how I was planning to solve this issue for the guests. I told him no one else even asked about parking and no one else has an issue for me to solve but him. Even people arriving from abroad didn\u2019t ask a single question - they just figured it out. So he got mad and canceled last minute. He really did not come. \n\nHe also tried to gaslight my mother that she cannot possibly find parking there (difficult but untrue, we all found free street parking) and that if she uses public transportation, she will be forced to walk 1 hr to the courthouse (untrue, it\u2019s a 10 to 15 min walk). \n\nShe also picked a fight with me the day before the wedding as to why I was making her walk 1 hr - to which I was incredibly surprised as I live in this city for the last 16 years and my brother doesn\u2019t live here and she still takes his word for it than mine. Obviously on the day of she realized I was right but never apologized.\n\nI\u2019ve been told that this weekend they are having my brother and his wife (26F) for lunch. They behave like nothing has happenned and my mother told me that she also sees \u201chis point of view\u201d. \n\nTo be honest I am not mad he choose not to come. I am mad that he berated me, questioned me, insulted our choices as a couple, complained for months, made the wedding about him and his comfort and parents see it as \u201chis point of view\u201d. Not a single word from both of my parents that my brother behaved badly. And now they are having him over for lunch, one week after my wedding. He never even wrote me a message to congratulate me on the occasion. \n\nI\u2019ve decided to cut contact with him as much as possible, but I am angry at my parents and I don\u2019t know how to navigate my relationship with them and if I cut them out too or not.",

From my earliest childhood memories, to well into my 40s.\n\nEleven years ago I cut off my entire family due to my brother's actions. I was already scarce for family events. But one situation was the tipping point. So, i cut everyone off.\n\nI didn't want to make my parents choose when making plans for holidays or dinners. So, I made the choice for them. I didn't see or talk to them for years. My daughter, who was in middle school at the time, would still see them. That was my only interaction. Picking her up. \n\nAbout 5 years ago I started to slowly speak with my parents more. My relationship will never be the same. They are not the type to talk about what happened. And since I have always been independent, they probably just chalked it up to that. We have a more surface level relationship. And honestly, that is fine with me.\n\nMy brother wasn't the \"golden child\" where he could do no wrong in their eyes. He was the problem child. And I was the well behaved older sibling that had to suck it up. And to be honest, we are very similar. And one time I even tried to have a heart to heart with him years prior telling him I understand him and I want to help him. We just handled our lives, choices, and everything differently.",

Attendance was about showing them that I value them, love them, and want to celebrate their relationship. There is no secondary point of view. Your mother has lost her mind if she thinks that there are two sides to this coin. \n\nIt sounds like this is just the latest installment of your brother behaving like a spoilt, entitled, self absorbed, brat of a human being. The wonderful thing about being an adult is that you can chose your relationships and set your boundaries. \"No I won't be belittled, criticised, screamed at, denegrated, argued with\" is a perfectly reasonable statement. Curring him off is a completely valid decision. You tell your parents that and tell them to respect that boundary.

        "post author": "Distinct-Way-4837",
        "text": "My little brother is about to leave for the army, and this was going to be the last birthday we spend with him for a long time. My partner and I had planned to take him to the beach (about 3 hours away), and we were both looking forward to it. But the day before, he changed his mind and said he\u2019d rather spend the day at the outlets since the weather wasn\u2019t beach-friendly. The outlets are in the same city, so we\u2019d still be going to the same area.\nI was thrown off by the change but understood it\u2014it\u2019s his birthday, and this could be the last time we\u2019re all together for years. The change of plans meant we\u2019d have to figure out what to do with my partner\u2019s dog. Usually, we take her to her mom\u2019s, which is over an hour away. I offered to leave work early and take the dog myself, just to take the pressure off her. She said it was too much to think about and told me to wait.\nLater, I brought it up again and said I could handle the dog, but instead of accepting that, she said she just wasn\u2019t going to come anymore. I didn\u2019t want her to miss it, so I told my family we\u2019d just bring the dog along\u2014she\u2019s small, and the city is full of dog-friendly places. I also told my brother that the last-minute change threw me, but that it was his birthday and I wanted to make the most of it.\nMy partner was really upset that I didn\u2019t push back harder or say more to him. She said I was a people-pleaser, an ass kisser, and even said I was afraid of my brother. It really hurt. I didn\u2019t want to fight with my brother over his birthday, especially when I already expressed my feelings once. I just didn\u2019t think that was the time to make it a bigger issue.\nShe ended up not coming. That was her decision, and I respected it, but before I left and right when I got home, she was extremely cold and hurtful toward me. When I tried to talk to her calmly about it later, she got aggressive\u2014clapping her hands at me, yelling, and I felt so overwhelmed that I had to go sit in my car just to calm down.\nThe whole day was already emotional for me because my brother is leaving. I felt like I did my best to balance everything, and instead of support, I got blamed and insulted. I\u2019ve been sitting with it since, wondering if I did something wrong, but deep down I don\u2019t feel like I did.\nWould really appreciate some outside perspective on this. What do you think?",

It's common courtesy to defer to the birthday person's wishes as to how they want to celebrate. Unless they are asking for something entirely unreasonable like a lavish weekend trip to Vegas or whatever, you do what they want to do. Your partner sounds entirely unreasonable. I imagine that you didn't even fully enjoy the birthday outing with your brother because the entire time you were probably thinking about the fact that your partner bailed on the birthday celebration and said horrible things to you. She sounds inflexible and downright mean. I'd be re-thinking this relationship. Did she even offer a reason as to why you taking the dog to her mom's was somehow unacceptable?

She will make it about her no matter what. Huge flashing neon sign, so you can ignore it and it gets worse, or do something about it. \n\nBecause what\u2019s the logic here? \u201cYou should have pushed back\u201d\u2026Hey sorry brother WE already decided what YOU will be doing on YOUR birthday, so that\u2019s that! Is that seriously her expectation? If so, I\u2019m guessing she doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends. You know how healthy balanced people react? \u201cOh, okay! Sounds good. What should we do with the dog?\u201d And go from there, because it\u2019s simply not that big of a deal. \n\nThe more subtle sign you\u2019re in a controlling relationship\u2026look at how you immediately in your head went to all these things you have to do to try to appease her and prevent her from getting angry. My guess is you often find your self anxiously rushing around on your own to prevent her backlash. It\u2019s not healthy. You shouldn\u2019t be afraid of your partner. \n\nThis is how she treats you and now this is how she treats your family. Her not being there when she had planned to be now put an elephant in the room for all during what should have been a fun day to celebrate. Sometimes we can ignore when people treat us like shit and excuse it, but are you now willing to ignore her treating your family like shit as well? \n\nTime to make some moves.",

Frankly, I'm embarrassed at the ways I acted, but I didn't know that wasn't *normal*. Wild mood fluctuations and emotional outbursts were the norm in my family dynamics; yelling, screaming, throwing things. All I ever knew was volitility. Taking into account that a lot of mental health disorders and personality disorders are passed genetically, I can go back through my family lineage and see just how dysfunctional both sides of my family are. Then I got medicated for bipolar. It had a *profound* impact on my ability to navigate changes and unpredictability. I got diagnosed late in life (41) and I sometimes wonder at how wildly different my life would be had I gotten on medication much earlier in life.\n\nIf you want to stay with this person and build a life with them, I'd make a mental health screening, counseling, and subsequent treatment a requirement to move forward.",

        "text": "Is my M30 wife F30 having an emotional affair?\n\nMe and my wife have been married for 1 year and together for 8. Her work likes to throw parties for the holidays at a managers house. I've never had issues with her going to these because she always let's me know where and when it's at, and asks me if it's okay. These parties weren't an issue until one night she told me that she took a guy from work to the party and I told her I wasn't comfortable with men being in her car. She said she understood and that was that. \n\nHowever, I made the mistake of snooping through her phone one night after one of these work parties and found out that she has been texting this guy (we'll call him james) and deleting their texts. What I found wasn't necessarily intimate, but they were playful. She was waiting on him to get there so they could go in together, she had bought him a pack of beer for the party. And he had responded with heart eyes. \n\nDo you guys see this as an emotional affair? The once or twice I've mentioned that I'm uncomfortable with her going out she's just said that he isn't like that and it makes me feel bad to doubt her. I've never met him so I can't read him myself. \n\nWhat can I do to make talking about this with her easier? Thanks in advance. \n\nEdit: I don't go to these parties because I don't like people lol. It's not fair to her not to go because I don't like to socialize. ",

Maybe she deletes texts because she feels like you'd be weird about it if you saw them. I mean, she bought a friend some beer for a party you won't go to and he texted her heart eyes. Honestly, that part doesn't mean shit. He was happy she brought him beers. All this is not to say deleted texts isn't suspicious at all, but maybe she doesn't trust that you'd understand their friendship. Who knows? One thing I would say though, if you start really distrusting her and its driving you crazy, you should probably just leave that marriage. Distrust can facilitate a cheating situation too. You'll drive her straight into the consoling arms of that person.",

I\u2019m in sales and very much segmented into a male dominated industry. This requires lots of socializing, networking and entertaining. I have a very outgoing personality and a great sense of humor. At this point in my life, I recognize that people flock to this, both men and women. My 2nd and current husband looks like a GQ model, but has a good deal of social anxiety unless he has been drinking. He also was an avid cheater on his first wife of twelve years. It\u2019s why they split ultimately. My first husband cheated on me regularly from the moment we had our daughter. That being said, I have lots of male acquaintances, some are associates through associations and boards, others are golf buddies from various tournaments, and some are prospects or clients. I\u2019m very friendly in messages and all of these folks know about my family as do I learn about theirs. The \u201cGQ\u201d husband is extremely insecure and I believe he thinks that I am always cheating on him, even though there has no indication of this and we are together way too much! For the most part, I delete nothing. But every so often, I have because I am aware that he will grab my phone from time to time and look at it in this insecurity. I am not going to do the work he needs to do on himself, he needs to do that and he isn\u2019t willing. We have discussed. I am as loyal as the day as long. We made a pact in the beginning that if we didn\u2019t want to be together, we would tell one another. I have a wonderful family and home life. By no means perfect, but nothing I am looking to screw up. \n\nIs it possible that your situation is more like mine?  Just saying\u2026",

        "post author": "ThrowRA-asdg",
        "text": "Lately, my (26F) husband has been getting on my nerves. Like really pissing me off.\n\nI am a seamstress who works from home and stays with our 3 year old daughter while he works at an office. For Easter, his family is staying at our place and so I've been stressing about getting the house ready to host for 3 additional people and also spring/Easter is my busiest time for sewing so I've been practically working 70+ hour weeks. Last week I had to stay up until 4am twice just to wake up by 830am with my daughter. \n\nMy husband has been not as supportive as I'd like him to be but I've been too stressed and overworked to even think about it and just tell him what I need him to do and that's that. For example, he comes home and if he's not doing anything I'll tell him to wash dishes or something. \n\nNow, this is the problem. That I have to *tell* him to do it. If I ask, there's a 50% chance he won't do it. If I don't say anything... 99% chance he won't do it. It feels like he's a child and it irritates me to no end.\n\nAnother problem is that he whines. A lot. Like a child. Complaining, venting... I understand (and encourage!) but no, he whines. That he's alwasy tired, alwasy hungry. Whines that I don't treat him like a man (mind you, he literally whines while he says this) and that he can't step up because I'm not letting him.\n\nWe've had talk after talk about this specific topic of me not treating him like a man enough and I alwasy tell him the same thing. That I'd love to hand over responsibility and be free of stress, please take it off my shoulders because I'm working from home, while being main parent, while also managing the household, while also managing our bills, while also cooking all the meals, and more.\n\nHe never does take anything off my shoulders.\n\nNow, today I finally finished my last dress at noon and began to do spring cleaning and managed to do a third of the house by the time husband came home. I had already made dinner so we quickly ate and we did as much yard work as we could without bringing out the loud tools since it was already almost 7pm. Got half of that done and came inside and it was like my husband clocked out for the day even though we had so much left to do.\n\nI was furiously spring cleaning as much as I could while my husband followed me with his hands in his pockets and talking. I kept reiterating that his family is coming tomorrow at noon and we need to get the house ready because they are staying for 2 weeks. He continued following me around until I outright told him to go start cleaning something.\n\nHe grumbled but started washing the dishes. Once he was done, he was back to sitting around and talking while I was still cleaning without a break. By now it was already 9pm so I snapped at him to stop talking and go do something. He threw his hands up and snapped back, \"What do you want me to do?\" And I'm not sure why but that phrase just boiled my blood.\n\nSo I was already upset with him when 20 minutes later, he starts whining that he's super tired. So I practically yelled at him to suck it up and act like a man. His parents are coming over tomorrow and he needs to do his part in prepping for them. \n\nMy husband called me a B word and layed down in the room and started watching *anime*. \n\nWe still have to wash and vacuum the floors, clean the bathrooms, meal prep for the guests  2 hours worth of yard work outside, all of us need to shower, and I feel like I'm going crazy because there's so much to do before noon tomorrow!!\n\nI also was planning on waxing because he wants me to but now, I'm not going to because I literally do NOT have the time for it so too bad for him. Lol this is such a tmi thing but i think it's funny.\n\nNow, it's 1am and he's passed out and I can't sleep because I'm so stressed. I'm starting to cool down a bit, and I'm wondering if what I said was harsh? Can I get some advice on what to do? Do I apologize?",

My mom would want everything to be perfect and my dad would think his family was coming over to hang out so no need to stress. Neither one is in the wrong, but hurt was still being had.\n\nSo the therapist told my parents that they needed to sit down and officially meet with each other at least two weeks before each party to express their needs. During these meetings, they would come up with a list of everything that needed to be done and then schedule and assign tasks. They got a notebook specifically meant for the meeting.\u00a0\n\nThen they would post the task list and schedule to the fridge. When we got older, my brother and I were included on the meeting and the task list.\n\nIt took a couple years to figure it out, but by the time I was in high school, we were amazing at it. I now do this with my husband and we our meetings board meetings.\n\nI know you should not have to tell your husband what to do, but in this situation, you need to clearly communicate your expectations.\nI also find the task list just helps my anxiety as well.\n\nNow, it does seem like you might have a bigger issue on your hand with the whining and imbalance of your workloads, and your husband might not stick to the task list, but if that is the case, you have a bigger issue that might need couples counseling or therapy.",

I get wanting your house & yard to look perfect but sometimes that\u2019s just not possible given the time you have. I think it\u2019s very unreasonable to say your husband \u201cchecked out for the day\u201d at 7pm. That\u2019s called night time and it\u2019s reasonable to check out at that time! I also think you were rude/unnecessarily gendered to tell him he\u2019s not a man or being manly because he was complaining about being tired.\u00a0\n\nI can\u2019t speak to the whining or other annoying behaviors because all I see is one person who is being unreasonable and that makes me doubt the other things you said about him without more information.\n\nWhile I do think you should apologize, that apology should come with some introspection and some hard work to change your behavior in the future.\n\n\u00a0I also think if you\u2019re going to be too busy to host you should not offer to host and be mindful of your stress levels and overall capacity so you don\u2019t overbook yourself. If your husband wants to host he can do so but then you should let go of your house and hosting standards since if he is hosting he may have a standard that is lower than yours and you should accept that.\u00a0",

        "post author": "violetree_xo",
        "text": "I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for nearly a year and while we were in bed last night he was scrolling through instagram and saw that a girl he used to do scouts with 9 years ago had messaged. She said she\u2019s coming back to town for the weekend and asked to meet up. I have bpd and i was really nervous but he assured me by saying she\u2019s unattractive and that they did kiss once 9 years ago but that was her kissing him and nothing ever progressed. This has now made me anxious. I\u2019m working today until 9:30pm and there are fireworks on local to us that we can\u2019t go to. He said their plans are getting dinner then watching the fire works.\n\nIt sounds a lot like a date to me and he\u2019s been really open about it but when you catch up work friends aren\u2019t you supposed to just get a coffee? Especially if you\u2019re in a relationship. \n\nMy friends are saying it sounds really bad and i\u2019m extremely anxious about it. I just don\u2019t think he should be doing that. Going to the fireworks with another girl cause i can\u2019t go\u2026?\n\nAny advice would be great, going to stay at a friends house tonight as I feel pretty upset and uncomfortable with him at the moment.\n\nEdit: He has an ex with the same name as her, he\u2019s never mentioned anyone else with this name which is also why I am anxious. He said it isn\u2019t her but the named rings a bell sorta thing. \n\nAlso to add, me and him rarely goes on dates because he\u2019s saving money and constantly working at his brothers flat helping decorating things but he has time to do this?\n\nHe is also not picking me up from work like he would usually because he\u2019s out with her (another thing to add)\n\n\nUpdate: I told him I wasn\u2019t comfortable. He said it was too late and they were about to meet up. He said I should\u2019ve told him sooner that I was uncomfortable and that nothing was gonna happen. Said I should\u2019ve suggested different places to go. Surely he should\u2019ve realised how dinner and fireworks sounds like a date. Spoke to a coworker and she said that that\u2019s what her and her husband did on their first date\u2026  They also haven\u2019t spoken in 9 years no means of contact whatsoever before this. Panicking bad now.",

You work during that time, so he could just go and you'd be none the wiser. He told you and was honest, because he has nothing to hide. To add, it's been 9 years. If something were to develop from their friendship, it already would have by now. I can tell you this though.

        "text": "Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 5 months and we\u2019ve had little ups and downs but one thing that really bothers me is that he isn\u2019t driven. He had some chronic pain when he started college at 18 and had to drop out, but since it has gotten better and he doesn\u2019t deal with it much anymore.\n\n\nThe problem is, he hasn\u2019t put any effort into bettering his life. He parents pay for everything (not just basic necessities, he goes out to eat multiple times a day, goes on trips, basically just gets anything he wants) he just started taking one online college course, he lives in a house with 5 other roommates who are clean, doesn\u2019t have a license/car and he hasn\u2019t looked for a job since he dropped out of college. But personality wise he is very sweet, emotionally intelligent, and overall a great guy.\n\n\nI\u2019m quite the opposite. I have had a job since 15, and currently work 50 hours trying to save money while being in online college full time as well.\n\nNow with having some background information, here\u2019s my situation. I\u2019m planning on quitting my job and doing some solo backpacking for a couple of months and really have to save all the money that I can. My boyfriend says he understands, but whenever we hang out, he always wants to go out to eat, and when I say that I don\u2019t want to , he makes passive aggressive and rude comments about it. Since he doesn\u2019t have a car I usually pick him up, but it\u2019s getting expensive picking and dropping him off every day, so I\u2019ve been suggesting we meet places separately, and he says that it\u2019s too expensive and I should just pick him up (even though he hasn\u2019t once offered me gas money) \n\nAm I being too rigid and stingy? I\u2019m also wondering if we are just not compatible as people, and maybe this relationship won\u2019t work because our drives are different?",

But he is a full-fledged adult by every measure, and not only does he have no ambition at all, he's selfish and a user . . . and with his own parents, no less, which is horrible.

I dont feel that it is too fast or anything, but sometimes we have talked about having sex, I am a virgin and she is too, but I have a constant fear that after we have had sex for the first time then how it would affect our relationship, like will it increase our love or will we only talk about it and nothing else and start to lose each other. I am an overthinker and these questions bother me a lot, like what will happen after doing it? Will we start to not love each other like this or will the love grow after that?. I havent been romantically close to any person in my whole life but I feel this is faster than normal, not like from a subjective perspective but from an objective view, I dont feel wrong about it, I love her and she loves me. But I just cant get over it sometimes thinking that I might lose her and that escalates the fear more, that what if it is everything that we talk about afterwards? This is a stupid que I guess, but please help me guys.",

It\u2019s actually really good to learn how to please her before having intercourse because very few women climax from PIV. Really good. For men, climax is easy especially with PIV and it\u2019s just not that way for women. Look at it this way, holding off will also make you a better lover. So. Trust your gut.",

I don't think most relationships built mainly on sex are likely to last, so I think it's good that you're thinking about this.\n\nI think that if you've been seeing each other pretty frequently and communicating a lot, it's possible to build enough of an emotional connection within a month or two, so you might be at or near that point already. The key factor I think is that you want to be together because you enjoy being together (doing things that aren't sexual) and if for some reason one of you doesn't want sex on a certain day, you'd still be wanting to be together.",

Is there something here I could\u2019ve done differently or better? I don\u2019t understand how this has backfired onto me. \n\nSo tonight me and my boyfriend are meant to be going out with a group of his old school friends. I\u2019ve met them all before, they\u2019re all nice people and fun to hang around with. There is one girl however\u2026 for the purpose of this post I\u2019ll call her Dee (24 F), I don\u2019t dislike her, I\u2019ve just always been uncertain around her, maybe due to her really flirtatious and reckless nature and the fact that she doesn\u2019t mind seeing other men despite having a bf too. But other than that, she\u2019s always been nice to me. \n\nThis morning in bed me and my bf were looking over some old photos from before I met him. School/college photos. Amongst them all there were selfies of just himself and Dee. I jokingly said \u201coh there\u2019s that one, did you have the hots for her? You\u2019ve got so many pictures with her?\u201d. I know I technically set myself up here I just wasn\u2019t expecting him to actually say yes, in a way? \nHe laughed and said \u201cyeah I would\u2019ve dated her if she\u2019d given me the chance\u201d. He must\u2019ve quickly recognised the sad look on my face and immediately tried to make up for it by saying \u201cBut I would\u2019ve dated anyone back then\u201d.\n\nWe didn\u2019t argue, I didn\u2019t make a scene, I just rolled over in bed and he did the same. After about 10 mins of laying in silence I got up and went downstairs to start my day, made a coffee and sat in my usual spot in the kitchen. \n\nAfter 30 mins, he came down. Really mad. Questioning me. Accusing me of taking his \u201cpast out on him\u201d, kept telling me how lonely his childhood was and that now he can\u2019t tell me anything because I\u2019ve made him feel guilty for it. I tried to deescalate things, tried to get him to sit down, he wanted me to apologise but was just getting angrier that I wasn\u2019t and started swearing. Eventually I apologised but told him that he was invalidating my feelings too. He refused to apologise to me, said that my feelings weren\u2019t valid because \u201cof course I love you\u201d.\n\nKinda just sat here now. Questioning what to do, he\u2019s asked me to leave. I just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m really the bad person here. \n",

Educate on emotional manipulation tactics like guilt trip, victim playing, blame shift. So it\u2019s either that, or this was a certain trigger of a generally healthy partner, then I would dig into why this particular topic had such an intense reaction. \n\nBoth options are not great, but through the last one, you can work through easier.

There is obviously no reason to be sad that your SO fancied someone in the past. And while this girl is flirtatious, he is in a relationship with you. So you need to be honest to yourself first, and to reciprocate the honesty he showed to you: why did his answer hurt your feelings?

This is potentially one that got away and it now raises the question, what if she prepositions him *now?* How will he react?\n\nPeople will attack you for not trusting him, but his reaction is that of an untrustworthy person. He swore at you. He yelled at you. He made you apologize to him and you did in hopes to deescalate. But it didn't work, did it? And what exactly was your crime again? Having the wind knocked out of you for a moment?\n\nThat is all bad behavior on his part, and I'm sorry, but it is a much bigger concern than Flirty McGee.\n\nHonestly, IME, trust is a momentum that must be maintained. It is not inertia. It is OK to question blindly trusting someone when they hurt us. His reaction was not a safe one, and blaming his childhood was rich. What if you have childhood trauma? Will he excuse himself while further invalidating you? Will he continue to threaten to not share things with you because you dare to feel some type a way and try to process those feelings?\n\nI'm going to tell you right now that the last one is most worrying to me. My husband uses that excuse to hide things from me and lie to me. He won't accept that when he first betrayed me with lies was the reason why I have trouble trusting him. Instead, he rather blame me for his lying. It's a mindfuck and I hate my life. Don't accept this treatment for fear of being marked as jealous or being shamed for not blindly trusting someone after they've hurt you.\n\nAnyway, it's ok to question. That doesn't make you a jealous person. It's perfectly reasonable to do when new information is obtained. What makes a person jealous comes from how they handle trusting/not trusting someone.",

It\u2019s a very unhealthy way to manage disagreements in a relationship and I\u2019d honestly rethink being in a relationship with him. \n\nYou will have many disagreements if you stay together long term. If this is how he manages confrontation it will mean you do not work out problems, but that he will throw your upset at you, try to make you feel guilty and then want you to admit you were wrong for disagreeing or having an emotion he is unsettled by. \n\nIs he the type of person who is willing to learn and develop his relationship skills? I think learning how to manage conflict in relationships and at work should be taught in schools. We are so affected by what we witnessed our parents doing in their relationship that it is common to have poor conflict skills.  I do my best to avoid any conflict and then feel resentful and let things build up.  I have tried to learn how to manage it better and to try to be braver about facing it, but I do think it has affected me negatively throughout my life. \n\nWith regard to the subject of your post, it was a very silly think to say, are you telling me he would not have been upset if you had said you had wanted to date one of your male friends?  Some things are best left in the past and not brought up.  Yes you asked, but if he had said I would have dated anyone it would have been less hurtful. Knowing he had a thing for her and has all these photos would have irked many people I think. That said, try not to ask questions that are inflammatory that are not relevant, unless you really need to know the answer.\n\nHe clearly has poor communication skills so it is not a surprise he was clumsy with his answer. His conflict skills are toxic - have a think about how you want to manage this moving forward.",

I never had any problems with the other two girls he was close with. Just the one and I had good reason.\n\nDifference in my situation and yours was that I never asked. He confessed and wondered why I then had certain boundaries that I expected to be in place with that particular friend.\n\nYour BFs response afterward was uncalled for. He knew he fucked up and instead of owning up to it, he punished you for having a calm, measured response. That was disrespectful on his part.\n\nI should've dumped my husband 17+ years ago for how he treated me in the aftermath. The girl is no longer in our circles but I will always feel like second choice because he treated me as such for so long.\n\nDon't bother to talk to him about the subject until he has calmed down. In fact, take space away from him. It's not siLEnT tREaTmeNT because you will communicate that how he attacked you for being mature enough to take a moment to process what you just learned has made you feel unsure about being around him in the meanwhile should he come at you again.\n\nThen, process how you feel and what you would like to see or do moving forward.\n\nConsider: Does he still moon over her? Let her be all flirtatious with him because that's just how she is? Does he have boundaries with her that suggest a closeness that is greater than he has with other friends? Does he disrespect you/your relationship when he's around her? Does he favor her above other friends and/or you? Does he hide their communications?\n\nMine did all of the above, and yet I was the AH. Today, I'm done being blamed for everything he does wrong, so I'm soon to be out the door for good. Don't be me and ignore red flags by accepting his disrespect and empty words. How he acted over her might indicate how he will act whenever you have a disagreement or hurt feel8ngs \n\nIf he doesn't do these things or he doesn't balk at avoiding these things/has or will put up/respect platonic boundaries with this could-have-been/only-if friend, then you may have only a bump in the road here that is more about how to speak to/treat one another during a conflict.\n\nIf he balks and accuses you of awful things, like being jealous or an AH, etc., take it from me: walk away. Because, ultimately, the issue isn't her... it's how he treats you and whether or not it's safe to talk to him about heavy stuff. If your partner cannot handle issues as an ally, then don't be surprised when they treat you like the dragon, especially when they're avoiding accountability.\n\nGood luck, OP.",

He made YOU apologize for HIM hurting your feelings, and it makes me sad that he put that on you.\n\nYou showed emotional maturity by going silent and processing, you didn't start a fight immediately. And even afterward, you STILL didn't cause a fight. \nHe did because he couldn't own up to the fact that he said something upsetting, and maybe that he has questionable motives under the surface by keeping this female friend around.\n\nAlso a red flag for a guy to have a female friend in his circle, that he would've dated. Always a red flag when a guy keeps female friend around (especially if she's attractive, and she must be if he was once willing to date her) cause it's usually as a back up plan-- maybe that's not the case here, but I've never, ever, seen it not be the case. \n\nSo many red flags from this guy imo.",

It\u2019s normal to be a little jealous and hurt. Talking about it and sort of\u2026. integrating reality into your brain is what makes relationships deeper.\n\nWe aren\u2019t supposed to be happy all the time. Everyone can be a fair weather boyfriend or girlfriend.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t think you should be mad at hime at all. But a little hurt- I think if you didn\u2019t have feelings for him, it wouldn\u2019t bother you. But he should not get mad either. It\u2019s understandable to need a minute.\n\nI would definitely not care as much about the old crush as I would his being angry.\u00a0\n\nYou would have to be very confident (rare, everyone accuses every other person of being insecure when almost everyone is to a degree) or not have feelings for him to not care about this. But logically you shouldn\u2019t take it to heart. The reassurance and calmness in these situations build faith and trust in another person.\n\nI wish he would have operated with that knowledge. He could have really made a deeper connection with you here. Instead, he broke trust and safety. I get why you asked. And with these questions you get to know people better, and they know you better . Being happy about it isn\u2019t the point.\u00a0\n\nIf you yelled at him for it or something, I would feel differently. But just being a little taken aback by deeper, more intense feelings about it than expected is just part of being human.\u00a0\n\nHe really could have made this moment be a true show of compassion. Maybe even he would see that he means a lot to you and that\u2019s why you hurt.\n\nHis response did show you things about him, though. Things you need to heed.",

The only thing on your side is feeling unsure about them two but it\u2019s your right to feel sound if they were just normal friends you wouldn\u2019t act in so, so it\u2019s their wrong for giving you this uncomfortable feeling. You\u2019re still in the right! He also couldn\u2019t control the situation or his emotions and went down the route of swearing which might be scary for you.

You got the honest response (unless you are the type who likes to ask stupid questions, be lied to in response, and think that proves someone loves you). You then went into moody brat mode and gave him the silent treatment, being all passive aggressive (I find it hilarious how people always leave this part out in the 'they got angry out of nowhere' narrative). Grow up and use your words. Stop acting like the puppy that got kicked. You set him up for failure and then refused to apologise and now you play the victim\n\n\nI repeat. You are too immature and insecure to be in a relationship.",

Again...she said nothing about thinking he's still 'hung up' on his friend. She said the friend is always nice to her. Neither of them have done anything to make her think otherwise. But she got insecure over some school friend selfies from years ago. Then she went quiet and said nothing else after he said he would've dated her or anyone else at that time (due to a bunch of context she's left out)\u00a0 - I don't really care about peoples responses here - for me immature women behave quite similarly to each other. Silence is their tactic. The silent tantrum. Making their partner feel bad for an insecurity born in their own mind - how coild it have been avoided? Well...Bf should've anticipated OP coming into his life years before the fact and never had any crushes or female friends to spare her feelings OFCOURSE!\u00a0\n\n\nIf anyone should have been reassuring anyone it should have been OP assuring her bf she wasn't accusing him of anything. But she didn't. She let it hang in the air then left him in the bed.\u00a0\n\n\nNow she's playing the victim and all the other insecure girlies who also suffer from retroactive jealousy are jumping to her defence.\u00a0",
