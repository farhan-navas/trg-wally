        "text": "My husband (38m) and I (33f) have been married a little over a year now. I have 2 kids from prior relationships and we have been talking about having a child together, but I don't feel right now we should because we have a lot to work on in our marriage. I his mind the baby will save everything. Been there, done that... It doesn't....\n\n\n\nA little backstory: we moved during my birthday month (January) and with that move we said we were going to postpone Christmas and celebrate it in February. So I didn't get anything for Christmas (I still got him something) or my birthday. February comes around and we didn't celebrate Christmas and I didn't get anything for Valentine's day, but I got him something. Our anniversary was in March and I went all out because it was our first and he didn't get me anything. His excuse was \"I didn't have any money\"! Mind you, he is the bread winner. I handle the finances, but if he says I need money I give it to him. \n\n\n\nNow fast forward to mother's day... I've been telling him how much it bothers me that especially for our anniversary he didn't get me anything and I went all out for him! I felt unloved, unwanted, and underappreciated (especially after finding other women in his phone not once but twice and have been working on forgiving him). He said nothing. Hasn't apologized or acknowledged my feelings.\n\n\n\nMy family invited us out to eat for mother's day, but he didn't want to go. Just wanted to stay in the house, as usual, and be on his phone and watch TV! I decide to go! Had a great time with my family, but also was down because he wasn't there. We didn't talk or text the entire day!!! Finally text me saying he needs gas for work..... Get home and still no words between us. I'm guessing he thought I was going to bring him something home to eat, but I told him we were going to a buffet! As he gets ready for work, he's slamming doors, throwing stuff, and cursing. Then left the house without his ring on! I know I'm not in the wrong and I'm not going to tell myself or let myself feel like I'm in the wrong, but wanted validation from others! Sorry for the long post! Just really needed to vent!\n\n\ntl;dr: My husband didn't get me anything for mother's day and he's upset! ",

Just going to be blunt here - you\u2019re in the process of forgiving him for, I\u2019m guessing talking to other women? And he makes no effort for you? Please stand up for yourself. \n\nHappy Mother\u2019s Day! Please choose happiness.",

At the beginning of our marriage he encouraged me to gain some weight because he likes \"thicker\" women. He cooked constantly and my weight began to increase but then the intimacy slowed down. That's when I found the plethora of women in his phone while I was feeling low. Decided to start working out and get back into shape and rebuild my self esteem/ confidence and he doesn't like it because now I want to go out more like we use to. \n\n\nThank you!!! Happiness all the way!",

He\u2019s not going to suddenly realize how much he loves gift giving and be amazing.  He wanted you.  He got you.  He\u2019s done trying.",

I have to give time to see the changes take place to be fair. If we were just dating yea sure, you gotta go, but we are married.... I can't just give up as easily because I said I do.

What he really needs is to learn how to talk about and share his feelings.  He needs to learn to give love, affirmations, be unselfish.

He asks you for money? Come on. A confident man wouldn't be comfortable in that position, he'd make sure he had his own funds available at all times. And the funniest part is he talks to other women!

        "text": "So let me start off by saying that  I have my wife blocked on here temporarily in order to avoid any confrontation in a negative way while seeking advice\n\nI (33 m) no longer find my wife (30 f) physically attractive. She has really let herself in the past year and a half and completely stopped caring. She says she doesnt see why it matters. The most physical activity she has done in this time period is every day she walks around 2000-3000 steps from the parking lot at work to and from her car. She then will counter this with a half a sleeve to a sleeve of Oreos or something similar portion size as a \"reward\". I have a job that requires me to stay fairly phycally active, as well as hobbies that require the same.\n\nWhen she attempts to make progress in the right direction and she will do it one time. When she can't do a single part of it, she is done. She attempted yoga. When she couldn't do one of the poses, she went into full on mental breakdown and never touches it again. I've offered to quit going to.the free gym at work and start going to Planet Fitness with her. She says it's \"Out of the budget\"  We make six figures as a household. If PF is out of business, we need to reevaluate out here.\n\nThe point where I got tired and frustrated was this past week going to see Metallica in concert. It was in a small city where there is no adequate parking at the actual venue. We had to park in a garage about 3/4 of a mile away. I was walking at a fairly normal pace. I had to stop every 2-3 minutes because, according to her, I was \"running\". Walking back after, me and my dad were both intoxicated and it only got worse to the point where I was having to stop about twice as often as I did on the way to the concert, in addition to the traffic leaving.\n\nI'm at the point where I have no idea what I need to do here. Every time I mention a solution to her, she has a excuse. She SAYS she wants to be more physically active and get back in shape... But her actual physical actions say the opposite. I can only do so much to help her\n\nTl;dr: I am not sure what to do in this situation. I am starting to think I'm not attracted to my wife's laziness when it comes to her physical health.",

I attempt to take over cooking but she will eat 2-3 times the size of a portion and she won't eat vegetables. She won't stick to the healthy snacks. She will just go to the store and buy the unhealthy snacks. Meal prepping had helped for a short period.. But if she has to eat the same thing more than maybe 2 days in a row, she will go behind my back and eat out without telling me. We work opposite shifts... So when I leave for work, she is leaving the office. When I get home, shes in bed sleeping. When she gets up.for work, im sleeping. We have attempted to.do hikes and such.

It\u2019s pretty clear her endurance is low currently so maybe a low impact activity like swimming? How far were your walks? I\u2019m guessing they may have been a little far for her and she got tired and gave up, so maybe try talking to her and gauging when she starts to get tired?

Im not currently, but in the past, I was extremely depressed. I sat inside and played video games alot. Now that I have outdoor activities I enjoy doing, ive developed the mentality for myself that I don't want to be a fat piece of shit and make it a habit to do things outside instead.\n\nI believe she is dropping because when things get hard, thats what she does.

I asked my husband if she hurt herself while playing earlier with him and he said no and called her over and made her stand on two legs on the ground and two on his lap to cuddle. All I said was it\u2019s not time to snuggle and that I wanted to see if she was still limping. But we had plans to watch a movie after and now he won\u2019t sit in the same room as me. When I went to the bedroom to lay next to him, he left to the living room and told me to go do my own thing which I\u2019m doing now since I\u2019m not going to force him to sit in the same room as me. But I did ask what was wrong and he said that I was trying to make him be the bad guy earlier and was accusing him of hurting our dog. I wasn\u2019t though and know he would never hurt her.\n\nAll I wanted to do was make sure our dog was okay and I didn\u2019t say it meanly when I said what I said.

I say this as someone with a therapeutic lens and with deep compassion for what you\u2019re experiencing.\n\nIn both situations, you're expressing very reasonable concerns \u2014 clarifying rental policies, checking on your dog\u2019s limp \u2014 and your husband\u2019s responses have involved emotional withdrawal, defensiveness, and blame-shifting. What\u2019s particularly important is that when you try to express how his behavior affects you, you're met not with understanding, but with comments like \u201cyou\u2019re too sensitive\u201d or being told to \u201ccontrol your emotions.\u201d This is a form of emotional invalidation, and over time, it can leave a person feeling unsafe, unseen, and unsure of themselves.\n\nThere are also some markers in your posts that may suggest narcissistic traits in your husband\u2019s behavior:\n\nA tendency to externalize blame and avoid responsibility\n\nReacting with coldness or silent treatment rather than communication\n\nDismissing or minimizing your feelings\n\nBecoming angry or rejecting when gently confronted (as in your couples therapy experience)\n\nAnd consistently needing to be \u201cright,\u201d even at the expense of emotional connection\n\nIt\u2019s also quite concerning that you\u2019ve begun to internalize this dynamic, saying things like \u201cI always say the wrong thing.\u201d That kind of self-doubt is often a result of being in a relationship where your emotional needs are regularly invalidated.\n\nIt\u2019s clear you\u2019re trying very hard to communicate respectfully, to de-escalate, and to care for your relationship. But emotional safety has to be mutual - and right now, it sounds like you\u2019re carrying the emotional weight alone.\n\nIf it\u2019s accessible to you, I\u2019d strongly encourage individual therapy - not because you are the problem but because you deserve support, clarity, and a space that\u2019s just for you. You\u2019re not overreacting, and your feelings make sense in the context you\u2019ve described.\n\nYou deserve to feel heard, respected, and emotionally safe - consistently.",

He's getting tired of it. And this situation right now might not seem like a big deal, having to tell your partner the same thing over and over again is draining and ends up in resentment.

        "text": "I\u2019m 25F and I\u2019ve been engaged to my 25M fianc\u00e9 for the past 6 months. We were in a relationship in our early 20s, broke up, and then got reconnected through our families a few years later. We decided to give it another chance and eventually got engaged. While there\u2019s been an emotional connection, there\u2019s also been a recurring imbalance in how we show up for each other.\n\nOver the past year, I\u2019ve been managing fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, and recently got diagnosed with depression. Despite my health, I\u2019ve continued working full time and have done well in my career. He has been struggling after losing his job a few months ago. That said, the emotional distance and avoidance were present even before his job loss.\n\nThroughout our relationship, I\u2019ve made multiple efforts\u2014clearly expressing my needs, asking for couple therapy, and even traveling to see him despite serious health issues. He hasn\u2019t once visited me in the last 6 months.\n\nWhen I shared my depression diagnosis and said I\u2019d appreciate him checking in around my doctor appointments, he said I was \u201cacting like a kid.\u201d I stepped back briefly to process things, and in that time, his parents called me to say they wanted to end the engagement. He didn\u2019t contact me directly\u2014not even to check on my health.\n\nWhen I later called him out on how emotionally unavailable he\u2019d been, he lashed out, called me \u201cstupid,\u201d said I made everything about myself, and that I was emotionally too much. He also said he wanted a \u201csoft and peaceful\u201d partner and that I made him feel unsettled.\n\nI\u2019m not perfect\u2014I\u2019m emotional and I express what I feel. But I\u2019ve tried hard to make this relationship work. I know he\u2019s going through a hard time, and I don\u2019t want to disregard that. Still, the way he\u2019s handled my vulnerability and health challenges has left me wondering whether I feel emotionally safe in this relationship at all.\n\nI still care about him deeply. I wanted a life with him. But now I\u2019m stuck wondering:\n\t\u2022\tAm I being unreasonable in what I asked for?\n\t\u2022\tShould I wait and see if he comes back with genuine willingness to work on this?\n\t\u2022\tOr is this emotional pattern unlikely to ever change, no matter what I do?\n\nWould really appreciate any honest, kind, or even tough-love advice\u2014especially if you\u2019ve been through something like this.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nTL;DR:\n25F engaged for 6 months to 25M. Struggling with health and emotional needs while he\u2019s been distant and dismissive\u2014this has been a pattern even before he lost his job. After I shared my depression diagnosis, they want to break off the engagement, not him. He later lashed out, saying I\u2019m \u201ctoo emotional\u201d and not peaceful enough. I\u2019m starting to feel emotionally unsafe and unsure if this will ever work.",

I have had issues with my wife for the past 1 1/2 about sex, consideration for our 2 year old son, how she treats herself, how she treats me, and her lack of motivation to take steps in the right direction. She has past ptsd that she refuses to address with her therapists, doesn't ever want to be vulnerable with me, and when I try and give her more resources to support her, she claims she is too \"prideful\" to accept it or never uses it at all. Our sex life took a hit after my son was born but I was understanding because of what pregnancy does to the body, etc. She was supposed to see a pelvic doctor and obgyn's but always missed appointments and sometimes never followed up. I suggested different alternatives in the bed but was meant with a firm no. I later found out besides bodily pains post pregnancy it included prior self body positivity issues, yet I was still being met with insults like \"I'm too vanilla\", didn\u2019t want me to flirt with her (even though when I stopped she would ask what's wrong?), made fun of my features / hair loss, and didn\u2019t want to physically be around me. \n\nMoving on, there are times when I need her to help me get our son's edicational paperwork filled out, or turned in, or just contact our's son pediatrician for documents. She procrastinates then I either have to pick up the slack, we argue, or she asks me to do it. I'm an army captain and work in areas that keep me from having my cell phone (office phone has no caller id or missed call function), plus I have meetings on top of a bunch of other things that could cost me if I don't perform great. I get no slack or understanding ever from her because she didn't get it prioir to her medical retirement from the military, which isn't right both ways. \n\nI usually end up doing all the adulting, get yelled at if I neglected a chore which is fair but she doesn't alway hold herself to the same standard or when I make note of it she gives me the cold shoulder. She takes online classes and our son is in daycare usually from 0700 to 1800. To top it all off she puts all of her friends above me when it comes to spending time or planning events (I'm not invited to anything even then mixed gendered stuff, yes I asked).\n\nI have enrolled and payed for us to go through marriage counseling twice (currently enrolled now) I think its kind of helping but I have also made it all known to her and reached my wits end. Back in February and told her if nothing changed I would start the divorce process after we PCS because I can do better being alone and raising our son instead this uphill battle and with always more effort on my part.\n\ntl;dr wife not being considerate enough thinking of divorce",

She had no issues doing everything needed until you got married and it wasn't as easy to walk away. I don't say this lightly. I was SA repeatedly as a child. My hubby was my first. We dealt with issues early on, and again when the trial happened. It's not like I went years and then it was an issue. At that point it's an excuse.\n\nMaking fun of you, your hair loss, body etc is ridiculous to me and just plain mean. Fyi there are a whole lot of women into bald men. My hubby was losing his hair at 19. He shaves and is absolutely sexy as hell, and that's after 31yrs together. I still love it.\n\nYou are with the wrong person. I rarely suggest divorce because I feel like most people don't even try now days but the exception is abuse. It's not just you she is neglecting, abusing and hurting. It's your kid.\nGood luck",

Is that what she wants?\nWas she desperate to keep you?\n\nRemember that if you want your marriage to work, it has to be the two of you against the problem, not against each other.\n\nRelationships are frustrating, because you can't make someone do something they don't want to do, even if you know it would be a great outcome for all parties.\n\nWhen you've been tolerating things like this for a while, you can end up enabling bad behaviour by walking on eggshells, and tolerating their crap. You can also want to pick a battle from every problem.\n\nWith the phone calls for your kid, I suggest you take it on yourself for now. Find a way. Email. Respond out of hours. When you need to pick an appointment time, give them 5 options to choose from. Sure it will be longer and more painful, but it takes one stress or away from your marriage. \n\nWhy exaclty is your wife medically retired? Is she still physically hurting from the incident? Mentally hurting? \n\nI get the impression she's kind fo given up on life and is completely overwhelmed at the mountain of challenges she sees ahead of her to get her life back together. \n\nEvery time you want sex, give her a non sexual hug for 30 sec. and then don't make any moves. And accept no sex. Keep doing this a million times. Eventually she will initiate sex again on her own terms, once she feels unobliged. \n\nInvite her on a date where you both get dressed up. \n\nTake care of business. Women don't want to have sex with a man baby. If she's had to clean up after you, she feels like your mom. Make sure you've given her no reason to feel like your mother. \n\nStop worrying about what is your fair share and do extra for a while. See what happens. \n\nDon't chuck away your marriage. You'll have to see each other constantly to coparent your child for a very long time.\n\nIf she won't go to therapy, go alone. They will teach you skills for things you can do without her participation.\n\nYou think walking away will be an escape from all your problems. But you may find it's just a whole new set of problems.",

She expressed she was sorry I felt that way but nothing else was done afterwards.\n\nShe was forced out of the military due to a combination of physical and mental problems. But you are right in that she has made it very clear of not want to be here (like exist) anymore but not to the point where she has a plan or is committed to anything. She's just majorly depressed and even our therapist has recommended she seriously consult with her doctors about her medicine not being as effective anymore but I have no faith she will follow through and have it checked.\n\nI want to initiate more dates but it always feels I'm the one putting the time into plan everything meanwhile she is always is searching for the next concert or trip to see her friends. I am the one planning the family vacations, she may suggests ideas but if I don't put the follow thru it won't happen no exaggeration. \n\nI'm not delusional to think relationships will always be 50/50. But when I'm doing an overwhelming portion of everything in the relationship it gets tiring not knowing when the scale will tip in the other direction so I can get some support. I have tried putting extra work in around the house while maintaining at work a few months ago for a month, couldn't sustain that before reaching the verge of a mental breakdown. Didn't see a change which led to me telling her of my thoughts of divorce.\n\nI am working on myself through therapy because I'm not perfect but her lack of change is the unsettling part and she currently has anxiety we will be moving close to her mother who can be critical but also gets on her for not taking care of business to support.",

She doesn't need couples therapy, she just needs therapy. Unfortunately she might be so depressed that therapy sounds pointless to her.\n\nI have definitely been depressed, and have come back from it. I like to feel that I'm protected from it happening again, as it was triggered by multiple depressing things. And when some of them resolved, and I learnt some skills, I'm now resilient and able to avoid the risk again. Unless a lot of terrible things happened!\n\nMy sister and her husband divorced after 30 years. His mother died at the 15 year mark. And he stopped working. Then he claimed he couldn't work because he was depressed. He was also emotionally abusive to her and the kids. She had been out the door for 2 weeks and magically he was back working again. I know him fairly well, and I honestly believe he did feel too depressed to work, and I think the fear of needing to be able to get a mortgage to buy out his half of the house was enough to \"snap him out of\" at least enough of his funk to magically go to job interviews after 15 years of barely working.\n\nYours isn't a clear cut case. It seems like lots of your wife's stuff is about her being depressed. And then trying to address any issue just makes her feel more hopeless.\n\nIt's really hard, because you're trying, and she's fighting you. So you just want to give up! Just be aware that this isn't rare. I assume its instinctual in some circumstances.\n\nYou may well come out the other side of this happier and stronger than before. But probably not before it gets worse. You've got to ask yourself how much energy you have for that. And how good it really ever was. If she really was once an awesome person who you could see yourself growing old with, I'd encourage you to keep going. \n\nBut don't use your current approaches. Change it up entirely. Anything you'd normally complain about, don't. Anything you normally don't bring up, bring up.\n\nI also wanted to comment on the shut down thing. I have to admit, I do that. I do it when I don't feel safe, when I think I won't be heard compassionately, when I think my partner is listening just to argue the opposite. Basically if I know I'm going to lose the fight, I'll disengage. If I feel confident that the conversation will only have negative outcomes, I won't participate. I now have a better partner who can tell when I'm doing this, and seems to know how to get me to talk. But I am still resistant at first from so many bad experiences, starting with my dad, or just wanting to be contrarian, rather than resolve the issue.\n\nHave you tried a book or audio book that goes into lots of depth on turning your relationship around? One from someone who has been doing this a long time, like Dr Phil or Tony Robbins or the men are from Mars guy. I feel like that tradional Dr Phil one really switched something I my mind. That you can only change yourself. And inspire the other perosn to change. You can't convince them to change.",
