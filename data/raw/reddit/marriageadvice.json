        "text": "Me(28 M) and my wife(26 F) has been married for about 3 years. We used to both work but in mid 2024 she got laid off, so i have been the sole income earner since. I make just enough for us to live on but that means we don't have any surplus to be able to save. Now, she is not doing nothing, she keeps the home clean and cooks everyday which is a lot of work as well, so i don't want to insinuate that she isn't contributing. She is. But I am having a lot economic anxiety about living paycheck to paycheck. It is still comfortable, but i could lose my job someday and all of a sudden we'd have no income. I have brought this up to her and she does say she will find something, but she isn't really looking. I just don't make enough to be able to afford a stay at home wife. We do have about $150k in savings though so maybe that is what gives her a bit more confidence to keep this going. I don't want to sound like a broken clock about this with her but i don't think she shares the same sense of urgency as i am. \n\ntl;dr: Can't afford a stay at home wife, not sure how to tell her to get a job.",

Maybe have a sit down with her about budgeting, or meet together with a financial advisor. Put some goals down on paper, discuss how much will be needed for retirement, kids (if you plan to have any), vacations, home costs, etc. It does help (in my experience) to see financial planning and budgeting broken down, what\u2019s needed for month to month living, and how it will affect the future.",

That\u2019s very different but just to be an adult at home\u2026..? \nMaybe she could find remote work and work from home. I think it\u2019s pretty well understood that in a marriage with no kids, both adults would work outside the home and contribute. That said, once she starts working, the house stuff should be 50/50. So, if you like not having to cook or clean, keep her at home. If you are willing to take on those responsibilities as well, she could contribute financially too. Even part time would be better than nothing. \nYou want to be able to keep saving money for retirement and that would be easier with both contributing.",

If it\u2019s the first, then tell your wife what is going on in your job market and how you fear being laid off could happen sooner than later. If your concern is more about a recession, then you could work with her to give her some time to find something she finds suitable/enjoyable. Supposedly a recession isn\u2019t suppose to happen until the end of the year (last I read) so maybe discuss the possibility of her having a job by the fall or picking up something part time until then to contribute to the savings.

        "text": "My husband is almost always in a bad mood. I recently learned about the \u201cmiserable husband syndrome\u201d phenomenon and feel that he fits the description to a T. I\u2019d love some advice from anyone who has made it through this and gotten to a better place. \n\nThere are two main things that my husband often mentions as sources of his unhappiness. 1. His job and 2. Our sex life. He does work a very stressful job and I don\u2019t want to downplay this at all though. He is such a hard worker and is amazing at what he does. I do my best to make sure the home is clean, full of food, and peaceful when he gets home. We do have a 1 year old, but he is always very cheerful with her, so even though she does cause some chaos, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s making him unhappy. He is a great dad.\n\nAs far as the sex goes, he has complained a lot about the lack of frequency of our intimate encounters. It is difficult with a baby, but I have been doing my best to initiate sex and offer him oral more often. This has been met with a secondary complaint, which is that the sexual experiences are not satisfying enough because he doesn\u2019t think I seem \u201cinto it\u201d enough. I am trying my best but I will admit that the pressure does get to my head and so I probably do need to improve the quality of sexual experiences I\u2019m giving him. I will continue to work on this, but I will admit, my confidence has taken a hit. It\u2019s also hard at times to get my libido going when my husband is being so negative and moping almost all the time.\n\nHe will often mention that he is just deeply unhappy with life and feels completely miserable and depressed, but when I ask him to talk about it with me, he refuses to elaborate and will often snap at me if I continue to pry. I have finally gotten him to seek some help for what I think could be depression but so far, the medication hasn\u2019t seemed to help either. I love him and want to make this better, but I feel like his heaviness is starting to pull me down too, and I don\u2019t know how to make things better.\n\ntl;dr My husband is almost always miserable and I don\u2019t know how to make it better.",

Did he not know that the sex life changes after babies and the first three years?  It goes back but takes effort from both sides, including him. What is he doing  to make you less overwhelmed, touched out, to think sexy? Is he giving you time away from baby and house stuff?? \n\nDoes he realize his complaint about \"not being into it enough\" is why women fake it? Or start thinking sex is a chore?

We have a 6 year old and 20 month old and im the main caregiver, i would say i do 90% of the work with the boys and he works full time and has several side gigs. I\u2019m a full time yoga and pilates instructor but i control my schedule so at the moment its part time. He provides money so he expects sex almost every day, we have sex between 2-3 times a week and he complains all the time. I would have sex more often but his attitude towards it makes me feel so anxious about it. He wants me to initiate even though he knows I\u2019m so bad at that due to past traumas, i just sometimes feel like im too touched out or i just want to crawl out of my own skin cause im full of anxiety, despite all this he still doesn\u2019t understand and makes me feel bad. We\u2019ve been together for 10 years but this started after having kids. I\u2019ve been dealing with it by having sex every time he asks or just forcing myself to initiate every few days. Sometimes i feel like maybe im the problem and men/society expects you to just have sex all the time to justify your existence or worth. Sorry for the rant but your post made me get emotional knowing its not only me living like this.",

                "body": "I\u2019m a 48 year old mom of four. I just want to say there will be many ups and downs in a typical marriage relationship. In my opinion, weathering the child-bearing years is the most challenging part. We have seen many people not make it through that time and I always want to tell them just to hang in there a little bit longer because it does get better and it does get easier! It\u2019s busy, you are both exhausted and the libido suffers because of it, especially for the woman. There are SO many hormonal fluctuations for us. From a biological perspective, our libido does drop after we have children. We made the baby, now it\u2019s time to take care of it\u2026.no more sexy time:) Men, well their body says keep spreading that seed\u2026..\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab It\u2019s important for every man to understand the biology of his wife\u2019s body and to be empathetic to her post baby changes. Having said that it\u2019s only fair that we recognize they also have needs, but how about he jerks off and takes care of his own needs if it so pressing?\n\nAs a woman who had had to \u201cput out\u201d for the last 33 years, it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s exhausting to always be sexy, sexual, and horny, and performative, FFS. \ud83d\ude14 you get to a point where you just don\u2019t want to be harassed constantly for sex. \n\nYou know what makes a mom that is in the throws of raising children horny? Well, not a man complaining about her performance and level of enthusiasm. In my opinion, during these years, the husband better take what he gets and not complain about it. There were many nights that I was like \u201cget what you need and leave me alone.\u201d And my husband never once complained. If he is getting head he should be ecstatic. Does he have a realistic vision of what married sex life is? Anyway, he needs to be kind, helpful, respectful and get his business in order in terms of his depression if he wants you to be excited for sex! When my husband would get sullen and cranky, I would tell him straight up, your behavior is not helping me to desire you. Help me, help you. \n\nAs the kids get older it does get better. It is true that men do get their sense of connection from sexual intimacy. With than in mind, I try to make sure we have sex once a week. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve got and I think that\u2019s reasonable given I\u2019ve been having sex with the same guy for 16 years. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f And sometimes you do have to pretend to be into it. Just make sure he is pleasing you\u2026.if he isn\u2019t that\u2019s a big concern. Of course you aren\u2019t going to want to have sex if you aren\u2019t  getting pleasure from it. If he\u2019s not making that his priority every time then\u2026.just NO! I truly hope he is pleasing you orally as well, or more often for that matter as most women do not climax from intercourse alone. \n\nI also just want to say, I think many many men(and likely women) do not have any idea what level of intestinal fortitude it takes to have a partner, children, home and show up every day in this world for their family, especially after their life this far has been fun and carefree. It can be tough work and it can be a lot on a person shoulders. He may not know how to deal with all the responsibility he has and because of that he is depressed.  When you choose to partner up and take care of children, well let\u2019s just says it\u2019s not for the faint of heart and that\u2019s why many people are unhappy and end up divorcing when the kids are young and it\u2019s not all sunshine and roses. \n\nMy husband and I made it thought that time. I jacked him up every time he got all sullen and salty. It\u2019s like, \u201chey, we CHOSE this. Sorry if it\u2019s harder than you thought it would be but now we have to suck it up, pull ourselves  up by the boot straps and carry on! I can say that my husband NEVER once complained about my lack of \u201centhusiasm\u201d for sex. There were many times when for me it was really about let me meet his needs so that he can feel good and then when there was more time, and I felt better it was about making sure that both of our needs were met. Every day is different. Some are amazing and some you just have to put your head down and get through. I think a lot of it is about being realistic about what REAL life looks like. Then you come together and figure out how to make life good and fun and every day a day to be grateful for. It\u2019s kinda like he will benefit from therapy and doing some inner work. Look up dark night of the soul. Sounds like he could be going through this. Sadly, men\u2019s emotions are often stuffed down because they had to do this to survive.",

Most of the time its a money thing without money you cant buy your wife good clothes so she looks fine AF, take her on trips, bottom story a man does not want to just feel like a bill payer it is already hard enough for a man to go out there make money come back and deal with more stuff make him your peace you got this we all go through this sometimes man needs you so be there for him but also work on yourself",

        "text": "My wife (36F) and I (42M) have been married 15 years.  For pretty much the entirety of our marriage I have felt like she is overly critical and negative. It feels like almost everything I say and do is met with some unkind comment and somedays it seems I can't even turn around without hearing about how I'm doing it wrong. In contrast, I get something positive or uplifting from her maybe once every few months.  On my side I am constantly praising her, telling her she's beautiful, that she's doing an amazing job in whatever thing she's working on, etc. I rarely criticize her. I feel like my job as her spouse should be to build her up not tear her down.  \n\nSo, is this normal? I see old married people who seem to fuss at each other nonstop over little things and it feels like that is what she's doing, but we're not old and it started literally the day we got married (she was never like that while we were dating). Besides, I don't want to be one of those people. If I ever bring it up she tells me I'm being too sensitive and I need to not get defensive, and to take her feelings more serious.  But I swear I never thought this would be my marriage, feeling like I have to second guess everything I say and do to make sure it won't upset her. Honestly, its exhausting.  \n\ntl;dr: wife of 15 years is constantly criticizing me and putting me down.  Is this just normal and im being overly sensitive or can I reasonably request she keep the criticisms to herself?",

That is actually one of the primary reasons we pursue relationships and why it is such an issue when a long term relationship loses \"the spark\".\n\nThis means you have been shaped by your wife, but more importantly, in this situation, your wife has been shaped or conditioned by you. I am sure there are many more examples of this but the little information you provided gives some great insight. You don't like that she criticizes you all the time, but in return for all of that criticism she is getting a cheerleader or hypeman. So you aren't just conditioning her to feel like her behavior is appropriate, you also provide positive reinforcement which is extremely powerful. \n\nUnderstanding you have a significant amount of responsibility here allows you to create change.\n\nYou also have to understand actions speak louder than words, and your actions encourage her behavior despite whatever you say\n\nAnother comment recommended the book No More Mr. Nice Guy and that would be a great place to start",

She asked if he spends his breaks there often and said that she said she could use a change of scenery. Upon reviewing messages they have shared through work chat and his phone, which he had deleted and never told me about, they message each other most days about what they are getting for lunch, favorite food places, favorite movies/shows, things they are currently watching, pictures of her Easter decorations, gossip about coworkers, she will text him if he calls out sick and ask if his family is okay. A message that especially bothered me was him asking her if she preferred the beach or the mountains. She replied \u201cThe mountains because the beach has sharks, to which he replied \u201cBut the mountains have the abominable snowman.\u201d \n\nI have told him for over a year that he needs to keep conversations with her work related as she crosses lines continually asking him to go places the two of them. I tell him that if he had made it clear she would not still be asking a year later, texting his personal phone, etc. She is the only person he talks to on chat at work this frequently, and the majority of the chat is not work related. He says he is acting perfectly, done nothing wrong, and that I am insecure, paranoid and jealous. That I am just picking a random person to feel this way about. Am I wrong to think he needs to stop worrying about offending her by no longer engaging in these conversations and keeping his conversations with her short and on topic with work? I feel he is valuing hurting her feelings over my feelings. I am not asking him to be rude, but there is no reason to not keep things on a professional basis. We are in our 40\u2019s, have been married 20 years, and he has had issues with female coworkers becoming too friendly in the past. that he confessed to me during a breakdown he had.\n\nTL;DR \nHusband\u2019s behavior with female coworker bothers me.

Because of my mental differences from most people I never felt like anyone cared to take the time to understand me when I expressed myself and she did until shortly after we married ( my assumption is that regret set in). She had told me that she would have still been a virgin if she hadn\u2019t been raped early in our relationship and then later revealed a couple months into marriage that the occurrence wasn\u2019t rape or her first sexual encounter. Around the same time she told me that after she realized she was going to be with me for long haul she went back to her ex for sex 3 times because she wanted to experience him again which she blamed on me because I hadn\u2019t fully told my ex to kick rocks (fair enough but it hurt). Every time I tried to express pain she wouldn\u2019t let me talk and yelled at me. I started yelling back. Eventually just to be petty after a yelling match I said that the Deftones were named that because they are tone deaf. She very much a fan and probably looking for a reason after all the yelling hit me in the face which opened a door. After the third occasion when she hit me in an argument I hit her back which opened another door. Sometime around that point I spit on her face intentionally while she was screaming at me very close. I excused it with her spit hitting my face while she was screaming and her not listening to me say that I can\u2019t take her spit continuously spraying me but I could have not done it. \nFast forward a few years and when are with our second kid on the way and still in an unhealthy marriage. At this point I am intentionally distant both as a weapon and a self preservation method. I would regularly see her checking guys out and be yelled at when I finally said something ( typing this out now I am wondering if this is when I got into calling her disrespectful terms). She has our second child intentionally at home with a midwife and it was honestly probably the best moment of our marriage. Then it all went back to hell. Regular arguments where she was hitting me while one of us was holding the baby. I occasionally hit her back. \nI eventually ended up with a job that I could work any and all the time and started just staying gone. Being away from her was freeing but also made me depressed which I brilliantly solved with a meth addiction. Several months, two affairs and one lost home later we are in a two bedroom condemnable house that I partially grew up in. It was the only place I felt safe growing up and I hadn\u2019t ever taken the time to grieve my Granny whose house it had been, so I was more unstable than usual. The usual arguments where I just wanted to be able to complete a sentence were in full force and I no longer hesitated to hit her back. I eventually hit her during an argument when I thought she was going to hit me. I went to jail that day. While on probation for that we decided to walk to the grocery store and I needed to grab something from inside. She hit me with the baby stroller and kicked me and yelling ensued. A lady across the street called the police who asked my wife what happened and didn\u2019t take her to jail for literally the same thing that I went to jail for except she used the stroller which to me is worse because we had a kid in it.\nWe started going to a church where she \u201cconfided\u201d in several people about me. I was starting to make healthy relationships with men who had good impact on me and then people started pulling back and making comments that obviously referenced our marital issues. I was alone again, all my old friends smoked weed and I was staying away from all substances because I was scared of a quick path back to meth. So I worked went home and went to church. I had no meaningful relationship and tried regularly to have one with her. She would regularly start arguments and sign up for trips to go on with her church friends ( not all the time but I wasn\u2019t able to do anything and was still the only one with an income). While in that house we had a third child. I had a couple of relapses and bounced back quickly.  We tried marriage counseling at the church. She let me know how worthless I was a few days before the counseling started so I went downtown to get drunk but cheated on her instead. Counseling was an unlicensed couple that made everything my fault. After she even said that was happening we quit going and faked a decent marriage. We got a Y membership and she started going a lot. I would regularly call her out for staring at other men and she would occasionally admit it. I quit going altogether after an event she was in. Every time I looked at her during the event she was trying to not seem like she was looking at a guy usually one guy in particular. I got punched the night she admitted to that. Around the same time she started helping with the nursery at a recovery meeting I was going to. While she was doing that I had to deal with her flirting with another nursery worker until he moved. She didn\u2019t stay helping long after he left town.\nAfter Covid happened I bought the house we are now in. She started talking about how I don\u2019t \u201clight up\u201d around the time of purchase. I don\u2019t and never have. I\u2019m on the spectrum and grew up with mental, physical and sexual abuse so I just like to be calm. She hid her phone a lot for a few months after we moved here but I didn\u2019t have the desire to ask why. We started hosting all the family gatherings and one of my little brothers got married to another man and started bringing him. You could see the way they looked at each other the second time he came around and it progressed from there. She has now put enough into it mentally that she has been breaking down crying and also lashing out abusively not just at me but also the kids. She told me about her feelings and how he makes her feel a week ago. Since then we have had a lot of open conversation that surprisingly hasn\u2019t gone to far south most of the time. She only gets really mad when I try to tell her things that helped me when I was going through the lust and infidelity. She acknowledges that she can see everything that I have been doing to try to meet her emotional needs and that they are the right things but says that it\u2019s not real because I don\u2019t desire to interact that way. It \u201cfake\u201d for me to do anything she says she wants.\nShe says she isn\u2019t going to leave but I can\u2019t keep doing this. She says she\u2019s going to call him tomorrow and tell him that she\u2019s putting distance between them at gatherings so he doesn\u2019t get taken off guard or get his feelings hurt and I\u2019m jealous of that to because I don\u2019t get the same respect. I\u2019m all ears for ways to help her get over this or ways to help myself be more normal and be able to \u201c light up\u201d.\n\n\nTl;dr My wife wants emotional things I can\u2019t provide and has fallen for my brother in law. Our 15 year marriage has never been good other than a few bright moments.",

        "text": "Ok so not sure where to start.I  (55M) and wife (53)Married 30 yrs. For the most part marriage has been fine have one kid will be 20 this year.\n\nPast 3 years of marriage has been sexless mostly on my side thats a whole nother story tho. This is what I found out this week\n\nFor some reason looking thru wifes email noticed a Target email for credit card with a balance. $7400. Which took me by surprise. Then noticed another card has $23,000. Now I'm in panic mode.\n\nSo after finding these two items I started digging more and long story short is she's ran up around 80,000 in debt without my knowledge.  She took a 18,000 loan last year without my knowledge. Credit cards with around $50,000. We already had some large debt but not unmanageable. But now with that it's a ton.. all planned vacations are now having to be canceled.  Any extra activity's are now done. \n\nSo my question or advice is what do I do. Kid is living with us till August. So now I have a sexless marriage and I've lost everything financially at 55yo. How do I stay in this marriage how do I move forward. \n\nI know I've prob left a ton out im not the greatest at collecting thoughts and writing them out. Plus I'm kinda just out of it. \n\nWe live in Florida so all martial debt is shared. Even if I wanted to divorce at this time couldn't even afford a lawyer. Our kid moves out to college in August at that point I'm thinking sell the house divorce and split what's left and at 55 go back to living with nothing. \n\nIt's been devastating I can't even explain it. \n\nHas anyone been in a situation like this. Your experience and advice would be appreciated. \n\n\nTL;DR spouse has ran up tens of thousands of debt without my knowledge. ",

I didn't find out about the first card until we filed for bankruptcy. We were better with cards after that but still managed to rack up $35k, but I decided enough is enough,we're almost 50, and having $35k in credit card debt was stupid at that age. So I began paying cards off one at a time working 60 hour weeks and in about 2 1/2 years we were out of that hole.\n\n So obviously I blew a gasket when I found out that she had racked up another $6300(but with 30% interest rate it was $10k). I had the money in the bank so I paid it off and told her if it happens again we are done. What also makes me mad is that I buy her almost anything she wants so there was no reason to do this.",

A lot of women end up with shopping addictions and get in so over their heads trying to cope or feel better about some aspect of their life. Then they feel worse,  try to cover it up but, it\u2019s usually so bad they don\u2019t know what to do. They\u2019re overwhelmed and now you\u2019re overwhelmed. \n\nI would ask her to see a therapist if this isn\u2019t something she is known to do on a regular basis. Is it possible she\u2019s depressed or developed a hoarding mentality? Sure, it could just be nothing but, people don\u2019t tend to dig such large holes unless something is going on inside of them. Especially, if they\u2019ve been financially responsible in the past.",

In my humble opinion, she has a long way to go to prove her worth to you. Not on the basis of \"not providing sex\", \"hiding bills\", or any other egocentric perception, but from the point that she checked out from working as a team through things that she feared your reprisal from. Her remarks of if you didn't find it \"she wouldn't have said anything\" denotes a lack of maturity and more so a lack of responsibility. My expectation is she might have more that you might have missed, and given the tone/demeanor suffers from some lack of remorse on the matter. Respectfully, keep your guard up and stand your ground on your expectations moving forward. I suggest the following:\n\n\n\nHave her present all of the hidden financial debts that she has amased (as you are in a split-debt state, its reasonable to request as you are liable and it's respectful to request/provide as your spouse. Hopefully you didn't present all your findings so you can monitor what she presents and see if shes being truthful or still hiding anything, keep this in mind). Next, if you feel like she has made substantial effort, provide the suggestion of either a DMP (debt management plan) or a debt consolidation plan. Both of their pros and cons, one is definitely more advantageous than the other credit history wise, but if the amount is large, the consolidation plan can nuke her credit, yet drop the amount quickly. As the debts are hopefully in her name alone, this will settle/lower the debts in her name. If she stays on track, you might be able to skirt the situation I ran into. \n\n\n\nFeel free to ask any more questions if this is at all beneficial. I'm open to discussing or helping anyone with what I went through, narc abuse, or w.e else. Part of my pay it forward mentality.",

We only see each other a couple hours a day. She had admitted to watching porn when I\u2019m not home, and I told her I\u2019d appreciate less graphic/vulgar material without me. We have good sex life. Every other day for years, and 7-10 times per week since she\u2019s been on trt for her perimenopause. So, we would check each others history on Reddit as foreplay. Something she started and it\u2019s fun. I checked hers the other day and there were only 3 things saved. I\u2019m like- hey, that sucks- your history is deleted. Geeez, you must\u2019ve been really dirty. Half joking. She blew up, and was insulted that I was accusing her of lying. She claims she never deleted. Couple days go by- history is full for both of us. Everything is good. Worked 15 hours today. Flirting with each other on and off all day through texts. She wants dick picks because she doesn\u2019t have enough saved. So, all is well. I grab her phone, and we\u2019re taking our clothes off to shower. Bam- she has 3 things in history. Knowing she told me she was horny browsing. Then I check her hidden, and she has more stuff in there. She claims because I made her feel like a pervert last month and she didn\u2019t want me to see, because it was too \u201cporn like.\u201d I was shook. I said you lied. I hate that. Mind you, we are open with this stuff. I said hiding history is like lying. You don\u2019t have to lie. I want to know about it all. Don\u2019t hide anything from me, I won\u2019t get mad. She jumps to, that\u2019s not lying. I\u2019m starting to get angry. Yes, it is. She goes on justifying and rationalizing. Big argument ensues. \nI NEED TO KNOW IF HISTORY IS AUTO DELETED ON REDDIT. My history saves the last 25 things I\u2019ve been on. She claims, he\u2019s is different. I\u2019m all fukd up about this. I don\u2019t care what she was looking at. I just can\u2019t handle lies. Please help. I\u2019m sitting in my truck for past 4 hours an emotional mess. I told her I can\u2019t handle lies.\n\nTL;DR  Wife\u2019s history on Reddit keeps \u201cauto deleting\u201d I\u2019m crazy. She is adamant that she hasn\u2019t deleted \n",

        "title": "Cheated and Confessed:  Should I (34m) tell my wife (34f)  about these details that I\u2019m struggling with ?",
        "post-author": "MR_M4DM4N",
        "text": "SHE CHEATED:\nMy wife (34F) and I (34M) have been married for almost 10 years. She cheated  on me earlier in our marriage. She was caught sexing an ex. It destroyed me but \nI forgave her and we moved on. I never told a single person about it because I wanted to protect her for feeling judged, humiliated, or criticized by our family and friends all the time, but also because it embarrassed me and would make it harder for us to heal. \n\nIN BETWEEN:\nFast forward to the last couple years: I have been really struggling because our work schedules barely give us any time together, and in that time she rarely wanted to spend it with me. When I saw quality time, I dont just mean sex. I mean just anything from cuddling on the couch, watching our favorite TV show, sex, or other things we used to enjoy doing together. Instead she\u2019d sit on the opposite side of the couch and sit on her phone, or instead of cuddling in the couch and watching tv, she\u2019d say she was tired and just wanted to go to sleep, then when I\u2019d go to bed 1-2 hrs later she\u2019d still be awake and on her phone. And would get mad or defend whenever I complained about it. I understood we were both tired but part of me started fearing that maybe it could be happening to me again. And I have been really struggling with depression and anxiety from it. \n\nI CHEATED:\nA couple months ago, I had to travel away for a training class for work. While there, I ran into an old acquaintance that I reached out to for divorce and child custody advice from when I was debating on divorcing my wife when she cheated. (We never spoke again since that). One night our class went out to dinner and drinks. Afterwards we all went back to our hotel and played card games and had more drinks. Her and I began talking for a while and I was telling her that I decided to stay with my wife and all of the struggles along the way. I knew that I had quite a few drinks, but at no point did I ever feel I was at near my limit or had too much. (I know myself pretty well). Eventually everyone else left and it was just her and I still outside talking. At some point I started getting emotional and broke down while telling her that I\u2019ve been depressed and feeling like she may be cheating again because she never wants to spend time with me, cuddle, or anything, no matter what I did. And I felt like she didn\u2019t love me, want me, etc. \nthat\u2019s the last thing I remember clearly from that night. I have a very faint and cloudy moment where I remember being in the room, and she was on top of me and had no clothes on and she was saying something but idk what it was. \nWhen I woke up I still had my shirt on but nothing else,  I had realized what had happened. I freaked out and went back to my own room and have a full blown meltdown and panic attack. \nI came home and told my wife that I had cheated and that I was drinking and guess had way too much and blacked out. I didn\u2019t remember really any details about out but I knew we did it because of what faintly remember her on top of me and that I had only a shirt on when woke up. I willing told her everything that I remember about it because I love her and I couldn\u2019t live with the fact of knowing I failed her and let it happen. But I reassured her that it was not premeditated, it was not revenge, and at no point that night did I ever find myself wanting to do it. I got drunk, I got emotional for feeling like she didn\u2019t love me, at some point I blacked out and got careless and screwed up. And that none of that was an excuse for what happened, I\u2019m just telling her the truth and I take full responsibility for my mistake. **That is what I told her**\n\nShe broke down and was angry, rightfully so. She said doesn\u2019t know if she wants to be together anymore and thinks she wants a divorce. We agreed to go to marriage counseling but she made it clear that it was to fix ourselves and it didn\u2019t mean it meant she wants to stay. She\u2019s been speaking to her friends and sister about it and they\u2019ve been doing and saying exactly what you\u2019d expect. That I\u2019m this terrible person, pathetic, scum, not worthy, etc., while also hypocritically telling her that what I did was unforgivable but she did was okay because she was struggling, and even thought she was caught, but I openly came to her and confessed on my own, that it was years ago and I should have gotten over it or gotten help. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve still be doing everything I can to show her I love her and still want to be together, even though I\u2019m continuously being called all these terrible things by her sister and friends. \n\nHERE IS THE TRUTH:\nNot only have I been emotional wreck because I absolutely love my wife and hate that I hurt her. But I\u2019ve also been struggling because there is a lot of things about that night that do not make sense to me. I know myself very well. I have always been good about keeping track of how much I\u2019ve had and I\u2019ve always been good about knowing when to stop. Not because I fear I might do something stupid, but because I\u2019ve never liked getting drunk, or sick, or too impaired to make rational decisions. \nBut I do not feel like I had been drinking that much that night to even reach my limit, let alone to the point where I would black out. Also, there was never a single point that night\u2014even when I was emotional venting about things\u2014where cheating, kissing, or even flirting with her was ever crossed my mind. So im also an emotional wreck and messed up wondering if I really did drink too much and did this on my own or if could have been raped. Could I have been drugged? Could her or someone been putting more alcohol or something in my drinks when I wasn\u2019t paying attention or in the bathroom? Did we even have sex at all or was I just assuming that because I faintly remember her naked and on top of me grinding and I woke up with only a shirt on? I\u2019m driving myself insane over this.\n\nSHOULD I TELL HER?:\nWhen I told her that I cheated I left these key pieces of information out for a couple of reasons. 1) I was such an emotional wreck and felt so guilty that I never even really took the time to process everything and think about the details. All I cared about was confessing to the person I love, that drunk and made a mistake. \n\nBut I\u2019m struggling mentally and emotionally because I don\u2019t know if I should tell her all of these other details or not. Because 1)I don\u2019t even know if she would believe them. It may push her even further away and cause more problems and trust issues if she thought I was lying. 2) the thought of her reacting that way would hurt me in return because nothing hurts more than being accused of lying when you\u2019re telling the truth. And 3) with the amount of terrible comments and opinions that her support group is already saying about me, I can\u2019t even imagine much worse it would be if they felt I was lying too. I don\u2019t think I can take that much more pain and suffering than I already have.\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m already suffering and hurting because I have so many question about what really never happened that night. And keeping it all inside it just making it worse. But also, I\u2019m suffering because I don\u2019t know if telling her about all of this stuff will help or just make things worse. \n\nI am asking for advice from anyone who can maybe relate to this or can help me understand what I should do or how to get through this. \n\n\nTL;DR :\nNeed advice. I willingly confessed to my wife that I got blackout drunk and cheated. But I left out many details leading to the incident that have left me scared, confused, and questioning if I was actually drugged, taken advantage of, or even r*ped because I felt like she would assume I was lying and make everything worse than if I just left it at I blacked out and cheated.  \nI don\u2019t know if I should tell her these key details because I\u2019m scared it won\u2019t even make a difference and will just make it worse.

I think you care for your wife but don't love her anymore. \n\nLetting go just takes time. Accepting that your marriage is likely over is ok, it didn't fail it just ran its full course. You'll probably be better off divorced and healing away from each other. \n\nWrite a letter and put everything into it. If you do stay together then read it in therapy, but if you go your separate ways then you can hand it to her after.",

Which was making me feel she could be cheated on again. \n\nBut even feeling that for quite some times, i would never intentionally do anything like that to her. I would be respectful and file for divorce rather than do something unforgivable and disrespectful. \n\nAnd that plus the fact that I have always been a responsible drinker and aware of my limits, I just can\u2019t stop shaking those thoughts that it happened because of something else. Because the I feel the amount I had was still well within my comfort zone and limits. And I\u2019m always continuously keep track of what I drink and how I\u2019m feeling.

We give up our peace in the name of love and call it noble, but we don't owe that to anybody. Then when they don't abandon themselves the way we have for them we feel angry at the lack of reciprocity. The truth is you did the best you could to handle the situation and love her through it back then but she isn't you and it isn't back then. \n\nI do think there is validity in your concerns around your ability to consent. But the fact that your relationship is one where you are certain she won't believe you tells you that this might be a separate issue. I still think you should try to find out what happened. I know when I've been in similar hurt states as you've described I've blacked out quickly and made bad decisions. Taken advantage of or not, I think sometimes our subconscious mind takes advantage of an opportunity to seize something for ourselves.",

                "body": "I'm sorry you had to go through this. Legally, having sex with someone too drunk to consent (like black out drunk) is considered rape. To me, as well as the law, that changes this from you cheating to this other person sexually assaulting you. There's a big difference, morally. If the exact same post with a female had happened no one would be saying you cheated. It's not different, guys. Men can be raped, too.\n\nThat said, you shouldn't have told a person of the opposite sex all your marriage problems. That's often how affairs start. If you need to get all this out, a more productive place to do so would be with a therapist. That way you have a neutral party, privacy, and professional help to deal with any effects and get solutions for improving things. They can also help you develop coping strategies for your anxiety and depression.This way you won't be bringing your family and friends into your marriage issues or making them think badly of either of you. Therapy could also help you heal from trauma caused by the sexual assault. Throwing a mess under a rug does not make that mess go away, it just allows it to fester and become more virulent. You should have someone you can talk to, and you shouldn't have had no outlet to deal with your wife cheating before. That you weren't able to let that out then could be part of why you haven't been able to fully recover from being cheated on. There is absolutely no shame in taking care of your own mental and emotional well being. It takes strength to admit you need help.\n\nThere is a way to tell long afterwards if you've been rape drugged. Your hair. They can take a sample of your hair and see if you had rape drugs in your system in the last 90 days. I suggest you get a hair sample tested immediately. After you get the results, then you can think about whether or not you want to bring this up to your wife. Although regardless of what the results are, taking advantage of someone too drunk to consent is still considered rape. You can talk to a therapist and decide if bringing the sexual assault angle up to your wife would be worthwhile, and how to bring it up in a constructive way that won't further traumatize you. You could even have your therapist referee this discussion and validate that what happened was indeed sexual assault.\n\nYour wife may have an easier time staying in the marriage if she sees you taking concrete action showing you are committed to her. Make an agreement with your wife that you will stop drinking entirely so she sees you are taking steps to stay faithful. That would keep you safer, as well. If you feel awkward not drinking while out, nursing plain water in an alcoholic glass with some lime usually keeps people from commenting. Just never let your drink out of your sight. If you leave for some reason, order a new drink and a new glass. \n\nThat your wife wants to end the marriage now but not when she cheated before may be mostly about the current state of your marriage. You've already grown apart and stopped spending time together. I don't think thoughts your wife is cheating now are paranoid. If she is, she may be more willing to divorce because she already has an established relationship to fall back on and an excuse for friends/family that you cheated first.\n\nFor now, I think you need to focus on taking care of yourself after a traumatic event. Get your hair tested, get set up with a therapist. If your wife is willing to do couples counseling, get that setup as well.\n\nAsk your wife to give you time to get things together, as you gave her grace before. Hopefully if she loves you she'll agree to some time to work on things. Even if she doesn't, many countries have a waiting period before you can divorce. You can use that time to get your hair tested, come up with a plan on how to talk to your wife, heal from your trauma bit, and get your ducks in a row.\n\nPersonally, I would tell your wife that if she continues to allow her friends and family to lash out at you for cheating you'll name names and give context and evidence to her loved ones about her own prior affair. This can be a total bluff and still work. Sometimes pride and people looking down on your actions are better motivational factors than doing something because it's right. If you aren't up to that, block her family and friends from contacting you and don't open the door if they come to the house. The last thing you need after being sexually assaulted is people attacking you.",

The fact you choose to stay quit for her, but yourself was not great but understandable. Now your wife is running to tell people which is why your getting bad mouth. IF no one knows about your wife, then you need to talk up NOW. This is no longer just about your marriage. This is about you and your kids. She can use this to make issues with you later if you stay together or even divorce.\n\nYes, your affair was physical. But many people will say a emotional affair is worse. Due to the connection and bond made between the two people who connect. Think of it falling in love with another person type of issues. But at the end of the day you forgave her. If she refuses to forgive you, that is her choice. But it does show for sure how she thinks of you.\n\nBut maybe the marriage ending is the right thing. Regardless, I feel you should go to her and talk. Even make sure you say it where her sister and such if there hear how you forgave her for her affair with her ex when you found out without her telling you, but the fact you got drunk talking emotionally about his fears on things with her with another person who was drinking lead to your bad actions but told her immediately. You made a mistake, but kept hers secret to protect her while she decided to run and tell everyone who could make your lives harder if you reconcile the marriage. If she chooses to divorce, she has that option and right to pick. But you want to seek marriage counseling and work on fixing the marriage if you can.\n\nIDK if you was given more than you think or even drugged. I think you just over drink for a combination of talking about your relationship and was feeling the situation. Then you ended up where you was. Just because you have a history of how you drink, doesn't mean you can't have a single time on occasion where it goes bad. So you likely did over drink get black out to a point, and ended up having an affair.",

I'd keep that to myself since you don't have any proof and didn't bring it up to your wife initially. She'd just weaponize your experience against you even worse than she is now. Call a rape hotline and talk to someone about what happened to you. \n\nYou should quit struggling with your wife over the state of your marriage for the time being. Get yourself into personal counseling. You have years of pain to unpack. You may find you don't want to be married to someone that cheated on you then neglected you for years. The way your wife has behaved I wouldn't doubt she hasn't cheated, and even if she hasn't your marriage has been toxic for years. Now that you've confessed to cheating (whether that's true or not) she may use that as ammunition to divorce you. While it's unfair to pin all the blame on you, this is where you're at. It's no use fighting her on it by dredging her past up, she'll just lie and deny it. \n\nLet your wife make her decision, it may have already been made but she hadn't yet pulled the trigger on it. You may have just given her the extra ammo she felt she needed. Get counseling for yourself. If your wife wants to save your marriage let her come to you with an offer for marriage counseling. Talk to a divorce attorney, find out what they recommend you do and what divorce would be like for you. DO NOT TELL HER ABOUT THAT YET.  \n\nThere's no rush to divorce. The healing can start now. And it should. You need to learn the tools to deal with all this betrayal, neglect, cheating and unhappiness. You'll be in a better state of mind to be the best father possible to your kids, whether you stay married or divorce. Good luck, I hope you find peace and happiness in your future.",

Then congrats, you\u2019re part of the problem. \n\n1) I didn\u2019t mention the things that I would do to make her happy because those details weren\u2019t important to my already extremely long post.\n\n2) I also didn\u2019t go into details in this because I didn\u2019t feel it was important but since you seem to care about anything except the main points, here it is even though it\u2019s none of you fkn business. I reached out to her years ago because I knew her and her husband were divorced but still managed to settle everything without any violence and continued to co parent and remain friends. So when I was contemplating divorced, I wanted advice from someone with that specific situation because I was hoping to find a way to divorce peacefully without and chaos or hatred so our children could still be raised and have as close to normal lives as possible. That is why I reached out to her. To learn about the process from someone who had experienced and achieved the exact situation I was hoping for myself and my kids. Never spoke again after that. \n\nAnd 3. Maybe you should go back and reread the post because you clearly failed to understand any of it. \nI never once said I went to her room. We all went back to the hotel. And to paint you a picture, you open the door and there is a common area with a full sized kitchen and living room. And there are 4 individual hotel rooms per common area (not like a 4 bedroom suite or something). Basically every 4 hotel rooms share a full kitchen and living room area. We were all playing games in a completely different person\u2019s common area. And very casually we got on the topic and she asked how everything worked out. And I said good. I started with all of the good details and how we worked it out and even had another child. Later on we got back on the topic and i started talking about the negatives and it went from there. Just talked. Not even sitting by each other. But as well kept talking people started heading out. We kept talking about that and other random stuff in between. Not once did I think about flirting, or that i wanted to do anything with her at all. The only thing on my mind that entire night was that I just wanted my marriage to healthy and happy again. Then the last thing I remember was getting emotional about how I felt that it could be cheating again. Still felt fine. Usually when you drink way too much you at least have some sort of memory or gradual build up to where things start to hit that point. I still felt fine. Like I felt fine enough to drive if I had to (not that I would have). There was nothing! I don\u2019t remember how long the conversation went on. I don\u2019t rememeber if we talked about anything else. I don\u2019t even remember getting up to leave were I was. Nothing! Only that very faint memory during it. And then I woke up in her room. No where near the common area where we were at. It was like getting anesthesia for surgery. One second you\u2019re awake and talking, then it\u2019s like you blind and wake up in the recovery room. \n\nSo please, maybe take a second understand how I\u2019m feeling, what I am going through of this, and what I\u2019m asking advice for before you type your obnoxious and toxic bs response about irrelevant questions and your \u201c you did it to yourself\u201d mentality. So have a little respect. That\u2019s rude and disrespectful! Would you tell your best friend the same thing you said to me if she said she was casually talking to a guy and then blacked out and thought she might have been raped? No! You wouldn\u2019t. And it shows that you\u2019re no different from her poc hypocritical friends. \nYes, I could have simply gone to bed earlier. I could have also just went straight to bed after the dinner. But I did because at no point where there any red flags or signs that anything was going to happen or that there was anything wrong with sitting on opposite couches from someone and telling them how something I asked advice for years ago ended up working out.",

However lately he just isn't interested in sex. \n\nHe's very affectionate and loving outside the bedroom. Last year we even had a few months of 'second honeymoon' kind of time where it was like we were horny teens again. However the last few months, he's always tired or feeling bad on the weekends, and even when I go to bed (super early, btw) to be with him I get shot down. For a while I'd offer a BJ because that would surely get him in the mood... But nothing else follows. \n\nI go to bed with him naked, in lingerie, I'm open to absolutely anything he wants. I'm loving and affectionate outside the bedroom. I'm supportive of his career. We are very happy in all aspects, really... But this is really hitting my confidence. \n\nI've also recently lost weight but he's always been happy with my body no matter the size. I'm starting to feel like something has to be wrong?? I send him spicy pics thru the week. I enthusiastically give him head at any opportunity. I try to dress nice and look after myself. I shave regularly. I don't know what else to do. \n\nI'm considering making a log of my attempts (and failures) to try to find a pattern. Is that crazy? Is it age, and I just need to adjust my expectations? I'm open to any suggestions or ideas. I just want my man to want me again. Can anyone suggest things to try or do? \n\nTL;DR - Husband not interested in sex but still loving need ideas ",

        "text": "My husband is smart. He is an accountant and he worked in engineering and finance. He also does taxes on the side. So he is very smart. He is getting his masters. But its so frustrating how he sometimes does things that are things I'd say are stupid? Like its not incompetence or weaponized or anything. its almost like he uses all his brain function at work and by the time he is home with me he can no longer function. Which is so frustrating to me. We cook and clean together and what not and everything's good. But then during random times he does something completely out of character like his brain turned off?\n\nFor example: we went to get a car fixed at Goodyear, i told him to go inside and stand in line while I parked the car and get us checked in right. Well im sitting and waiting in the car for him to come back out or at least call me to tell me its done. But I don't hear from him for 20 minutes. I see other people getting helped and so i go inside and i see that he was just sitting down on the side? So i asked him like whats going on what did they say? And he said he went inside and then he didnt know what to say to the receptionist so he just wrnt and sat down and didnt say anything.... so we were waiting for nothing... this stuff just doesnt make sense to me? and ofc i get frustrated because what??\n\nHe does stuff like this often where im just confused at his actions? I dont know what to do because im really reaching a point where it feels frustrating to have to do everything for him which isn't true because he does do things for me but why does he do randomly stupid things like this? I genuinely cant trust him to do a lot of things on his own without giving him a step by step instruction and even then im worried he will fuck up something.\n\nTl;dr:\nMy husband is really smart but lately he had been doing some really stupid things lately and its been incredibly frustrating to me and I don't know what to do anymore. I love him and we are good but im not sure what's going on with him and I feel like I've been reaching my limit.",

He said that I really do expect to be treated like royalty. I calmly explained that no, this is me asking for the bare minimum.  He said but what do you do for me as a wife?  Keep in mind that I\u2019m his biggest hype man - even though he doesn\u2019t deserve it most of the time. I\u2019m constantly telling him how handsome he is. I cuddle him in bed. I am working so hard to get our house back on track. I was so confused as to what he meant. He said I should have meals cooked for him and that the house looks awful. I told him I just finished a meal plan and he said yeah but when are you actually going to DO it?  He doesn\u2019t help with groceries planning or any elbow grease chores. He goes and tinkers on his boat or something while I\u2019m scrubbing. He does a fair bit of dishes and a use they\u2019re his pet peeves. I also do these things, though. He is great about making sure trash gets rounded up for trash day.  FYI I do work full-time and actually make the highest salary.  Anyhow. He kept being hurtful until I cried and said never mind.  I\u2019ve slept all evening because I a, just so depressed. Not only do I not get any of my emotional or physical needs met but he\u2019s just cruel. He used to be so affectionate and wonderful. I suspect I was being love-bombed. Am I overreacting? He is like this any time I try to bring up anything. I\u2019m worn down. I\u2019m depressed. He won\u2019t go to couples therapy anymore.

I am finally mentally healthy enough to recognize the signs of this unhealthy behavior. \n\nI recently cried when a female coworker told me I was beautiful because it had been so long since someone had said those words to me. I had opened up to her and asked for her lawyers information. Her first marriage was like ours and now she is married to the most amazing guy who sees her worth.",

Maybe he feels inferior or not a real man when you mention this. Maybe how you felt after he denied you love out loud is how you make him feel. Sometimes, we think we're doing the right thing for someone and are completely oblivious to the fact that they need more or something else. Maybe his thoughts about love are different. I'm sure he doesn't complain that you cuddle him. It seems he does complain about dinner. Maybe fixing him dinner is love to him. You can not assume your meaning of something is the same for everyone else, even your husband. Maybe he doesn't know how to ask for what he wants, or he fears you'll get angry, or it's gone on too long without him discussing it, and it's turned to anger. Some men can say exactly what they need with the right words. Some men don't know the words to describe their needs or feel weird discussing their needs. He probably needs to go to a therapist alone. He probably feels ganged up on at couples therapy. His own therapist would help him realize how his actions affect others without making him feel attacked. Also they could guide him to understand how to communicate effectively and learn his needs. I'm sure you expect him to learn and correct his errors. Have you done the same? Have you considered how your actions affect him? I just say this because I feel like everyone always expects men to be tough or hard. Any human can only take so much before they crash. And crashes look different for every man. He needs loved out loud too. I said maybe the whole comment because, idk, maybe he's narcissistic. (I dislike that word.

It\u2019s like he only wants the parts of tradition that benefit him - if that makes sense.\n\nHe grew up fussed over by a mother and a significantly older sister. Like, worshipped. I believe this is part of the root of things.\n\nI am executing on my meal prep and planning today as I was going to before he said all of that. He never says it until I bring up something about him. I am on a GLP-1 for severe insulin resistance (it is helping so much, yay), so it is worth noting I do not eat multiple days per week and looking at food makes me nauseated.  That said, I am putting together meals I can freeze for him so he is taken care of even when I am not hungry or nauseated. It\u2019s just that this is just the latest thing.  Every time I do what he asks, it moves on to something else while nothing changes on his side. I\u2019m still lonely and completely without any physical touch or affection.  We still have yet to ever discuss him because each time I try, he comes up with a new reason that I am failing him and we never talk about what I wanted :( \n\nThe thing is - if his way of feeling loved is for me to work as many hours as him, maintain the house and the lawn (he\u2019s mowing the last few years after me doing it alone for 5+ years and is constantly complaining about it), doing all meal planning and cooking, taking care of our pets, and sitting home alone while he makes plans with his sister and just tells me he\u2019s going - no discussion - just I am going to do this now\u2026.I don\u2019t see how anyone can say okay I will give you all of that and make it to where I literally have no time to be me while you don\u2019t even hug me, hold my hand, kiss me, be intimate with me, tell me I am pretty or that you appreciate me, answer texts\u2026none of it :(",

If you say loved loudly to him, he might yell, \"I love you.\" If you don't get to say your piece to him. Write him. I kinda laugh as I type that, but I'm serious. Just don't write him a dissertation or anything, lol. Tell him you understand not having dinner ready bothers him. Tell him you prepped food for him so that you could prepare it and fulfill that for him. Then tell him a few little things that make you feel loudly loved. Simply say or write something like I feel desired when I'm kissed on the forehead (or however loud love looks to you). Don't overwhelm him, though, and make him feel like he can never accomplish the goal. Don't tell him any complaints. This is a positive chat. Tell him some things you like about him. And ask if he could do the same. If he can't at this moment, don't let your body language or your face show disappointment. Let him know it's fine for him to think about it, but you really want to know. After you and he chat/he reads letter don't say anymore about it. Give him the opportunity to come to you to love you loudly. But it may take a couple of weeks of dinner before he trusts that maybe this is an all-the-time thing now. If he comes to you and awkwardly says some dumb stuff, just hug him and flirtily giggle. Validate him. Ask politely and lovingly, not at that moment, of course (it'll be ruined), if that was love out loud from him. If it was, and you need more or better,  tell him practice make perfect. Also, understand that maybe you aren't ready to hear what makes him feel loved. So if he gets honest with you, don't negatively react. Don't cry or be mad. This will teach him never to discuss anything again. Just be ready for anything. I'd give him a bit to see you putting in work for the sole purpose of him before I determined the situation was doomed. And you have to really do it for him because you want to. If not, it will get old and annoying, and he'll notice. Simply because you said he thinks you think you're royalty.  (You're a woman too. We all are in our own ways \ud83d\ude09) Show him you'll be amongst the peasants for him.  \ud83d\ude0a If after 3 or 4 months there's no changes, I'd start working on my exit for irreconcilable differences.

I have some health issues but have recently lost thirty pounds and counting which has helped tremendously. I am trying hard to improve myself. I get into ruts where I do not cook and groceries I bought will go bad. I made a good meal plan today and plan on getting everything tomorrow. We have actually been doing great on that lately. From my side, my parents cause problems because they try to override my parenting (children from first marriage) when they visit 2x per year (they live out of state).  I think my oldest causes stress on us both. She\u2019s 17 and lazy. She has no rules at father\u2019s house. She needs consistency. She\u2019s in a magnet program that travels internationally, and I know that bothers him. I also have an 11 year old son who is high-functioning autistic.

        "text": "I\u2019ve never posted on reddit before, so be gentle with me. My (28f) husband (30m) and I have been married for seven years. We used to have a very active bedroom life. \n\nThen we had three babies within three years. We love our children and don\u2019t regret them, but the last pregnancy with my son (9m) nearly killed me and our son, and I spent a very long time in the hospital before the birth. I had a great medical team, but even with their help my baby spent time in the NICU because he couldn\u2019t breathe on his own. My husband had to pick up the slack at home with the other kids, which I understand was exhausting for him, particularly because I wasn\u2019t unable to work during that time so he was the only financial provider. The pressure on him was enormous. Obviously he was also terrified for my safety and our son\u2019s life.\n\nAfter I gave birth I fell into a deep depression that killed my bedroom drive stone dead. I know this was really hard on my husband, as we\u2019d always had a very busy bedroom life. We still did the deed, just not as often and I wasn\u2019t as enthusiastic as I used to be. I got therapy, I took the medication, I went and got some exercise and tried to get back to some version of me that I recognised. It\u2019s only in the last two months that I\u2019ve really felt my drive come back. \n\nThing is, he keeps rejecting me. It\u2019s like he\u2019s totally given up on the idea of it. I\u2019ve tried date nights, setting the mood, new outfits, etc. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s just not attracted to me anymore, or if something else is going on. I feel like this is my fault for not pushing harder to be there for him after the birth. He even rejects things like cuddling. It\u2019s been a really difficult few months for both of us, and now I just feel alone. I\u2019ve tried addressing this with him a few times, and he just gives me reasons like \u201cI\u2019m tired\u201d or \u201cbusy.\u201d Please, Reddit, tell me what I can do to get this back on track. Thank you for reading. \n\nTL;DR: husband keeps rejecting my advances after I\u2019ve had three babies and postpartum depression. ",

Get a sitter and put your relationship on a more equal footing as \u2018parents\u2019.  Your love deserves it and having joyous parents would help your kids as well!",

        "text": "I\u2019ve never posted on reddit before, so be gentle with me. My (28f) husband (30m) and I have been married for seven years. We used to have a very active bedroom life. \n\nThen we had three babies within three years. We love our children and don\u2019t regret them, but the last pregnancy with my son (9m) nearly killed me and our son, and I spent a very long time in the hospital before the birth. I had a great medical team, but even with their help my baby spent time in the NICU because he couldn\u2019t breathe on his own. My husband had to pick up the slack at home with the other kids, which I understand was exhausting for him, particularly because I wasn\u2019t unable to work during that time so he was the only financial provider. The pressure on him was enormous. Obviously he was also terrified for my safety and our son\u2019s life.\n\nAfter I gave birth I fell into a deep depression that killed my bedroom drive stone dead. I know this was really hard on my husband, as we\u2019d always had a very busy bedroom life. We still did the deed, just not as often and I wasn\u2019t as enthusiastic as I used to be. I got therapy, I took the medication, I went and got some exercise and tried to get back to some version of me that I recognised. It\u2019s only in the last two months that I\u2019ve really felt my drive come back. \n\nThing is, he keeps rejecting me. It\u2019s like he\u2019s totally given up on the idea of it. I\u2019ve tried date nights, setting the mood, new outfits, etc. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s just not attracted to me anymore, or if something else is going on. I feel like this is my fault for not pushing harder to be there for him after the birth. He even rejects things like cuddling. It\u2019s been a really difficult few months for both of us, and now I just feel alone. I\u2019ve tried addressing this with him a few times, and he just gives me reasons like \u201cI\u2019m tired\u201d or \u201cbusy.\u201d Please, Reddit, tell me what I can do to get this back on track. Thank you for reading. \n\nTL;DR: husband keeps rejecting my advances after I\u2019ve had three babies and postpartum depression. ",

She works, & is primary parent for our 3 kids.  I feel like my needs in our relationship are getting forgotten.\n\nWe have both been busy.  But we tried doing a date night, & long story short I ended up investing about $350 bucks for an evening in a hotel to basically just have a night away from the kids & get told \u201cI am just really tired, can we just go to sleep\u201d\nShe led me on, winding me up all \ud83e\udd86-ing week\u2026 in the end I end up investing a grip of cash for a Night without our kids, & without any physical intimacy.\n\nI questioned if I should even put forth any effort this year. If I should just forget the day as well & move forward with the regular work day.  But in my own heart I know that just don\u2019t sound Right.  It does not feel right.  I enjoy putting in those moments for my relationship with my wife.  It makes me feel like \u201cwe\u201d are real.\nBut after 2 years, & kinda feeling like my wife is more focused on being a parent, or a friend, & not really focused on being a Lover or a Spouse, I\u2019m starting to wonder where I go from here.

Currently, I am a truck driver, regional line hall.  My job affords us the capability to live a little more of a middle class lifestyle. We live in a great neighborhood, my kids can play outside in the backyard or in the front yard. They can ride their scooters down the street\u2026 There\u2019s a baseball field with a community baseball club that plays out of it Within walking distance. There are opportunities where I could get more rest, and make similar money; and not have to deal with a two hour commute daily\u2026 Except right now, I have a window over approximately 45 minutes every day that I get to interact with my family. As I work nights, at 45 minutes is precious to me. Then comes the weekend\u2026 And with kids activities and trying to help maintaining the house with three young children; opportunities for the two of us to have couple time is limited to nill. I\u2019m thinking what I might do is suggest that that we designate one weekend a month had a minimum, with hopes of possibly too; where we designate a day or evening to go out on a date just to enjoy each other, without our kids.  I\u2019m thinking I need to rebalance some of the priorities in our household relationship. And what I mean by that is, I think a lot of the time just due to the overall busyness of life. The two of us could have been way too busy with Ltd opportunity to really try to focus on us as us, versus us as parents and homeowners. Cheap prioritizes so much for the kids\u2026 She\u2019s a great mom; I wanna say she\u2019s not great partner right now as please let our anniversary roll by two straight years without doing anything to show that it\u2019s special to her, or that I\u2019m special to her\u2026 And that hurt kind of just layers over the scar from that failed date night. I try to be a good partner, I try to let her have what she wants if I can provide it; but I think that she may be a little more focused on providing the kids with what they desire, or so been thinking about what I made desire for time the time. It\u2019s understandable, we have three young children; but I mean it\u2019s my it\u2019s our wedding anniversary\u2026 It\u2019s a date night that she teased me up for, for the whole week prior to\u2026 I don\u2019t like the idea of starting the prioritize myself, and taking care of my own needs, as they are not gonna be met otherwise\u2026 I need to communicate this with her, and I know I do if I have any info of things changing for the positive. I\u2019m just kneeling all the advice I can from all of these great posts, so I do so appropriately, and she feels understanding after the conversation",

From his wife's perspective though, she barely had the energy to initiate intimacy after carrying the full mental load of child rearing, essentially organising all familial logistics and having to work as well. They had the added stress of recently having their oldest child develop Type 1 diabetes. He didn't take any steps to learn about th condition nor how to manage it. Instead he just let his wife handle it all and then let the resentment build up against his wife til it boiled over never understanding his role in why she didn't have the capacity for intimacy, but blaming her for everything. He is currently living at home with his parents.",

She wanted the nice room, she probably spoke all week about private time, but I guess accountability for her is out the window. \n\nSo in order for a man to have a good time with his wife. He has to work 80 hours, pay for said accommodations with money he has FROM not working (impossible for most), get the baby sitter, clean said home he pays for, cook for said kids (2 not his and he is financially responsible for) and then maybe, just maybe he gets to have quality time with his wife\u2026 \n\nSo in order for a man, who is the sole provider and has taken on the role of Father for two kids who are not his, he must work 80 hours a week and 50% of the house work, but before weekends out with his wife he must still work 80 hours and do 100% of house work. \n\nYou have got to be kidding me. So MEN NEWSFLASH. If you are the sole provider for your family which comes with an immense amount of pressure. In order to be seen as a \u201cGood Husband and Father/Step Father you must be two places at once. You must go to work because money is vital to the survival of said family, but while you are at work you have to also be at home to help said wife, again this must be at the same time. \n\nIf not expect your wife to sleep in a $350 dollar bed, when the one at home is free.",

Now as far as my job\u2026 I have to work so much specifically because we own a house, I have a Older trappings of a middle class life.

But I am what you would call a bonus Dad by two older children are my wife\u2019s kids from a previous marriage. When we got married , she had a distinct drive that we have at least one more child. One more child that would specifically be my own. She pushed for the emotional choice, while I was kind of pushing Moore a rational choice. In some ways it has worked out; by buying the house when we did, we have Managed to keep our household cost within a safe budget, while many families with adults in our demographic are renting, and having to fight a good fight against ever present rise of rental cost.  A lot of these choices have been driven by her desires\u2026 part of that 80 hour work week is a two hour round trip commute That I have to make to and from work. I wanted to look at homes in multiple areas of where we reside; she wanted specifically to remain in the same area, specifically in the same county due to political leanings; and due to my hours to provide and pay for housing, I kind of got bulldozed.  \nI wish I could take a couple hours back at my job.

My wife and I work for a religious non-profit, essentially taking a single modest 5 figure salary for the two of us, and we have 4 kids.  It's tough and incredibly stressful right now.  But we make do by scaling back on our lifestyle.  We were lucky enough to buy a house big enough for the family just before prices shot through the roof a couple of years ago, but aside from that, we've never had a car payment because we've never owned a car newer than about 10 years old, we rarely go out to restaurants, our vacations are infrequent and often paid for with travel hacking, and we put a limit on what sort of extracurriculars we let the kids participate in.  We're also fortunate enough to live near a large non-profit healthcare system that offers low income assistance plans, which keeps our medical expenses minimal.  And as much as we'd love to, we're not saving for the kids' college.  It's just not feasible.  Neither of our parents paid for our colleges either, so we spent our first decade or so of marriage paying off student loans and we weren't able to build up big savings.\n\n  \nBut it sounds like you need to make a change, because your current lifestyle is not sustainable.  Either you find a job closer to home that pays better, you manage to make big cuts to your spending, or you move.  You need to express to your wife a desire to be with her and the kids more.  I don't have anything against Catholic schooling (one of my kids goes to one for nearly free thanks to my state's school voucher program), but having their dad present and active in their lives and both of their parents in a stable, happy marriage is going to do them far more good than any sort of school ever would.  Frame it that way and hopefully she'll be a little more sympathetic to your plight, and the two of you can find some sort of compromise.",

I've actually joined reddit today and have come to this sub to post my own situation for some advice. \n\nWe've tried several of marriage counselors, including bringing him into my personal sessions. They have both been a bust. In my situation I think we actually need a negotiator to help him understand what he needs to do so that he can move out. I feel personally think I've exhausted all avenues.\n\nIs there something good to be salvaged? And if so, do both of you think that? Does only one of you want out? As long as you both think there is something still left for you two, I'd start trying counselors. Expect to burn through some because it's a mixed bag. If only one of you wants to remain in the relationship, I would seriously consider the logistics of how to split up. You both deserve better than this endless loop of stress.\n\nI love my spouse and have so much compassion for them, but I have so many regrets about allowing myself to be unhappy for so many years for their sake. Generally speaking, I think women are socially conditioned to put other's happiness before our own, and men are socially conditioned to let women do that - and carry all of the emotional baggage.

Since getting married I have spent less time with my friends due to the obvious duties of parenthood, a full-time job, and everything in between. Kids are in sports and other activities. This information is important later. \n\nI have noticed that he expects me to do all the house duties, including cooking AND dishes. Picking up/dropping off the kids. Grocery shopping, etc. Mostly taking care of the dogs (we both walk them). I have been trying to talk to him about my frustrations and I need help with certain things. He does do his part until he tells me things along the lines of \"I maintain the cars, fix broken things around the house, i do help you too with the things you do\" then he'll tell me that he is going to start cooking and go to the store more often. Start taking the kids to school. He does and then it all stops. \n\nGoing back to my main focus of the title: He always has plans, whether he makes them or he gets invited by his friends. On a random day during the week, he will tell me \"Sean just texted me and wants to have a few beers\" or \"this weekend I have plans to go fishing with (regular group of guys)\" he will always go. He will spend more quality time with the guys than with us. I am overwhelmed and tired. I keep reminding him that our kids have practice, a game, or a school event to attend. Whatever it is. He will attend the events and games but will still go out after. I do not have the time to go out with my friends to take a moment for myself. I have spoke to him about this over and over and he replies with \"I'm not stopping you\" it's not stopping me. It's clearly me being too busy for myself to see my friends kid-free like he always does. how do I get it through him that I feel unseen and taken for granted. \n\nHe goes out 2-3 times a week. I haven't been out without the kids in over 3 years. I love my kids and I am always involved with everything they do. The thing that hurts the most is when my kids ask where dad is. Where's dad now? Is dad with his friends again?\n\n- tl;dr : my husband spends more time with his friends than he spends time with our kids and I. I am upset and frustrated because I do most of the parent responsibilities. He goes out 2-3 times a week and I have not been out with my friends without the kids in over 3 years. How do I get through to him about this. I feel taken for granted. \n\nThank you in advance.  \n\n",

        "text": "Howdy folks. I wish that I had friends I trust, or have a strong enough friendship with, to bring this up with but alas I don't. So I turn to yall. Ive seen some behavior changes in my wife and they're coming across as red flags for me - but am I reading too much into this?\n\nBackground: she (45) and I (46) have been married 24 years. Two kids, careers, house, all the traditional things.\n\nThe red flags I'm seeing- \n1- she's started to focus on how her body looks and has dropped about 30lbs. This came out of the blue as she's not been this conscious before. \n\n2- she's opened a new credit card and amassed $20K+ debt on it in about 18months; she's not disclosed this to me and I found out through a credit rating service. I'm not able to tell what the expenditures are though. \n\n3- she's super protective of her phone and tablet; they're basically glued to her. Several occasions I've startled her while she's texting and she quickly hides the phone screen. Phone account is in her name so I can't see details. \n\n4- her sexual interests have changed and the sex she wants now is completely different from as recent as a couple of years ago; much less sensual.\n\nMy mind is screaming that she's cheating. Am I over reading this? \n\ntl;dr I think my wife is cheating and want a second opinion",

Make sure your ducks are in a row in case this all blows up and your marriage falls apart, and then confront her.\n\n\nUnless you have some other idea for how to see her phone, I don't see what other option you have. Cameras and voice-activated recorders around the house and then let her know you're going out for the day?

He\u2019s always had a temper and attitude but lately it\u2019s gotten worse.

He doesn\u2019t see any fault in any of it nor does he see anything wrong with his temper his excuse is well what you said set me off. He\u2019s always tired and irritable takes it out on me and the kids. He works 4 days a week and believes if he\u2019s off he shouldn\u2019t have to do anything if he does he will complain all he does is work and spend time with us. He claims he never gets time to hisself. But should I mention when we all go to bed he will stay up late watching tv. He\u2019s constantly on his phone with coworkers or on social media. It has gotten to the point our kids even complain about his phone use and his temper. Obviously I don\u2019t feel appreciated at all with everything I do. He just assumes what I do is normal for a SAHM to do and that the husband doesn\u2019t share anything. \n\ntl;dr when does it become emotional and verbal abuse. ",

        "text": "Let me preface this by saying it\u2019s about to be a long post, so buckle up.\n\nIve been with my husband for 4 years now (dating for 2, married for 2) and we have a 2 year old. I feel like our relationship has been deteriorating over the past year, and I know he can feel it too. In the past I haven\u2019t been the best partner, but I\u2019ve realized that and have been actively trying to change (esp after I got pregnant). I feel like I\u2019m with a narcissist but maybe I\u2019m just reading into it too much?\n\nPretty much any argument we get into ends up with me feeling like it\u2019s my fault and him not understanding anything I try to tell him. The other day we took our daughter to see a movie and overall had a good day. When he asked what we wanted to do for lunch I said \u201cwell what about panera?\u201d and his response was \u201cwell it\u2019s kind of expensive\u201d so I said \u201cok lets just go home\u201d probably with a little bit of snarkiness. this led to him instigating a fight about \u201cwhy do you have an attitude with me\u201d and him saying I ruined the whole day for no reason. He also kept telling me that he does everything for me and gives me everything I want so he doesn\u2019t understand why I act like \u201cI\u2019m so unhappy\u201d. He also jokes about beating me all the time and has said things a few times in front of our daughter. When I asked him why he jokes about stuff like that he said \u201cwell I would never actually hit you that\u2019s why I can joke about it\u201d. He also convinced me to quit my job about 4 months ago and I feel like everything\u2019s gotten worse since then. I know I\u2019m lacking when it comes to certain household chores, but he acts like I do nothing. Our toddler is very high maintance and requires a lot of my attention. Whenever the weekend rolls around he plays video games most of the time, and when I voice to him that I think he needs spend more time with us I\u2019m \u201cguilt tripping\u201d him but like our daughter is literally begging for him to come play with us. He blames everything on how he works 40 hours and week and work is stressing him out so he deserves his time on the weekends. she\u2019s also said that he deals with so much incompetence at work that he doesn\u2019t want to come home and be nagged at and just wants to relax. The straw that broke the camels back and convinced me to make this post was an argument we had yesterday. I brought up that I wanted to schedule my birthday dinner with my parents  on sunday, and he immediately got an attitude with me (as he usually does when I say I want to do stuff with my parents) and said \u201cI don\u2019t understand why we have to do something with them every weekend\u201d (we don\u2019t, he hasn\u2019t actually spent time with them in months) and he just needs a weekend to do nothing (even though we had plans yesterday and today). It\u2019s so obvious he just doesn\u2019t want to see my parents. In the past he\u2019s been upset bc I made plans with them without asking him first and this time I did bc he\u2019s voiced that in the past. He accused me of \u201cputting words into his mouth\u201d and that I was being ridiculous. He then came into the kitchen where I was feeding our daughter dinner and said \u201cyou didn\u2019t give her any fruit?\u201d with a hateful tone to which I responded \u201cI did she just ate it already\u201d somewhat snarky. He then popped off saying to \u201cdrop the attitude\u201d (his favorite line to say to me) and when I said \u201clisten to how you just spoke to me?\u201d and tried to explain why I was upset he said I was being \u201ctoo sensitive and that\u2019s my problem\u201d which he has said to me multiple times. I\u2019m just so fed up with him never taking accountability for how he treats me and when I try to bring up my feelings he immediately jumps to say \u201cok so everything is my fault? got it\u201d instead of trying to have a conversation and understand why I feel the way I do. He constantly tells me that\u2019s if i\u2019m so unhappy I should just leave him, but if I did I would literally have nothing. I have no job, no money, and nothing to stand on. He refuses to get a joint bank account and constantly tells me we need to save money, but has spent thousands of dollars on magic cards since last summer. I barely ever buy anything for myself and when I asked him if I could get some clothes for the summer he said yes but every time I asked him for the money he would get weird about it. I finally convinced him to send me the money for my birthday. There\u2019s so much more I could get into but this post is already getting too long. \n\nIf you\u2019re still here thanks for listening to me vent. I haven\u2019t been able to talk to anyone in my life about this. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: I feel like my husband is a narcissist and that I\u2019m stuck in my marriage. ",

Especially when you consider the age bracket. I read so many posts that I feel could have been written by myself OR my spouse! Most of us are dealing with lack of sex whether due to menopause or lower libido by the male, porn consumption, lack of communication, unfair splitting of household chores. Etc\u2026. So many of us are in the same boat! We reiterate each other\u2019s posts with our own spin. I don\u2019t know if this makes me feel better or worse lol. One thing I can say\u2026 even in my situation of feeling like I\u2019m not a priority the majority of days.. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just my perception or if it\u2019s reality. I don\u2019t know know I\u2019m still very much in love with my husband and I know he loves me. But we are all different! They say opposites attract. Maybe we need to stop fixating on all the wrongs and start focusing on the rights. \n\nTL;DR: I feel like most of us are dealing with the same issues so maybe we are actually in normal marriages despite our perceptions.

I enjoy solo activities ( reading, sewing, etc), he enjoys planning meetups and his podcast. 2\u20133 nights out of the week he\u2019s either on a planned COD meetup or hanging out with his brother or recording. I\u2019ve had to communicate that I don\u2019t want \u201cmore of the pie but my designated slice.\u201d I used to have the mindset that I wasn\u2019t a priority but i think that was just my perception but a little that he wasn\u2019t speaking my love language although still showing love.

        "text": "Married 18 years, been together 22 (I\u2019m 40F, he\u2019s 42M). We\u2019ve been through some rough patches raising our 14 and 11 year old kids. Covid, fire, job loss, chronic health issues with surgeries - most recent being my open heart surgery in December with a 3 month recovery but can take up to a year to fully recover. \n\nHe and the kids all have ADHD. For years we thought my fatigue issues were depression related and in reality they were related to the need for my surgery. \n\nWe also have a crap-ton of animals. 2 dogs, 2 cats, chickens which are the gateway, a duck, a peacock. \n\nI am the captain of the ship. But it definitely feels like pirates less than sailors. I\u2019d come in the house and a burner would on with a pan smoking, no husband in sight. He disappears into the basement better than any magician. He goes on more side quests than are even available in Zelda. Late for everything. A breaking point for me was a good mutual friend telling me, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it.\u201d Referring to my husband. I cry a lot. \n\nHe was there and supportive during my surgery. (His parents weren\u2019t. Didn\u2019t think it was serious). And his work allowed him to work from home during my recovery. I needed a lot of physical help and frankly still do (vacuuming, carrying laundry, yard work, outside animal work, gardening tasks - heavy lifting I can\u2019t yet do on regular basis) \n\nNow I\u2019ve done a lot but recovery isn\u2019t linear. I took a trip with my mom and then had a power day in the garden after really doing well at rehab but my guys see this and think \u201ccaptain\u2019s back\u201d and don\u2019t need to do anything. \n\nPrior to my surgery, we started marriage counseling and his ADHD was marked as a major issue in our relationship. He has sought treatment and has started medication but think it needs to be tweaked. He tells me last night, \u201cI need more help.\u201d (He\u2019s talking calendar, planning, task management - when I have established tools and group texts, calendars) And I about lost it because I have no more help in me left to give. I am not his mom. I am mom to two more of him I\u2019m trying to steer in the right path and I need him to put in some more work. I\u2019m frankly trying to get me back on track physically and mentally after surgery and still maintain our home somewhat since no one else is while also still working full time. I literally have to give direction to everyone in our household and I am so blankety blank tired of it. \n\nTl;dr Husband\u2019s ADHD is sore spot in marriage and wife is done helping him after recovering from own surgery",

A supportive husband will understand that. If he doesn't or he says \"well you're going out by yourself why do I have to watch the kid...\" Or something like that I would start to question his commitment to you and your feelings.\n\nFor example my sister gets her \"me time\" to go get a manicure or coffee or shopping without her kids in tow and her hubby is a dad and watches them. Conversely,  he likes to play hockey with his buddies (deck hockey in America) and my sister as the mom watches the kids while he's with his buddies.\n\nIt's balance and sharing responsibilities and acknowledging that you both are more than just parents and need to have some adult time too.

He came up to me and continued to scream in my face so I told him that he would have to fix it on his own, that I\u2019d made a mistake but that I couldn\u2019t help him if he screamed at me. I fixed it and went to our bedroom and locked the door. He kept bashing on the door and walking around to our balcony door and screaming at me through that that he didn\u2019t want to be married anymore, and that he was so unhappy in this marriage, and that I forced him to buy our current place (which could not be further from the truth, he pushed it. I didn\u2019t want a mortgage.) This continued and I stayed quiet not answering for 2 hours. He kept saying that he deserved to sleep on the bed that he had paid for (I paid for the bed with money I got when my dad passed.) and then at about 11pm he found a key that opened the door and continued to berate me.\n\nThen said, I don\u2019t know how we can have such a nice day together and then have these arguments\u2026 and then says that he doesn\u2019t manage conflict well\u2026he created the conflict.\n\nThese arguments over nothing happen quite frequently where he will bang on the door, belittle me with nasty words, or call me tens of times after he abuses me, I need a safe space and time to cooldown.\n\nHe never takes responsibility, what happens in his mind is no where near as severe as how he acts to me, and will say sorry but doesn\u2019t grasp what he\u2019s done and how it has ongoing negative effects.\n\nWhen I say I want to leave, he says that he can\u2019t start again and that he won\u2019t allow a separation. Then he threatens to say I\u2019ll get nothing in the divorce.\n\nBoth of my parents died of cancer and I don\u2019t have too many friends I feel I can talk to or get help from. I know in my heart that this isn\u2019t how I deserve to be treated, I know I want children, and I can\u2019t have them around an environment like this. But I\u2019m so scared to leave and don\u2019t know if it\u2019s justified.\n\nLife is so expensive nowadays and I\u2019m really terrified I\u2019ll be alone on my own with zero support.\n\nAny words of wisdom would be greatly helpful. What would you do in this situation? \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\ntl;dr my husband can be verbally abusive and I don\u2019t know what to do. ",

That is way to young to basically be done with sex with your spouse who (I assume) you still love and are attracted to.  What is a spouse who you never have sex with?  Basically just a friend or roommate, with a lot of additional legal complications thrown in.\n\nThe hall pass idea is a complete non-starter.  I suspect she knows you well enough to know that you would likely never use it.  So it is a way for her to make herself feel less guilty for withholding sex, without actually having to do anything.\n\nI think you need couples sex therapy counseling.  This seems to me to be primarily about her not making the time or taking the effort to be mindful of your emotional and physical needs.

If I want support while I deal with my stuff then I also need to support him because I am not the only one suffering. To ask you to turn your sex drive off isn't fair. To ask you to step out of your marriage because she's become comfortable and lazy isn't fair. Marriage takes work and it seems like you're willing to put in the effort more than her. Sex drive is no excuse to let a good man suffer. Using your hand or mouth has nothing to do with my sex drive but it helps him so why not? Its laziness and a lack of understanding how important that is for a man. Hope you get mad enough to explain this to her. Too many men suffer a sexless life because a woman gets comfortable and lazy.

I then get told his job is what paid for our winter vacation, and that we would get by fine without my money and job, basically saying I don\u2019t contribute much. If I upset him in anyway, he basically will go days without speaking to me, won\u2019t accept my help for any of his business stuff and then just blames it on he has a lot on his plate and since I don\u2019t I will never understand. I just recently got to go on a vacation, which he can\u2019t go on a vacation until the winter months when his business isn\u2019t running, he admits he was jealous I got to go. I\u2019m not sure what to do about that. He tells me I\u2019m not grateful I got to go which is not true. \nI\u2019m tired of feeling like my feelings don\u2019t matter, nothing I do is appreciated or worth it. I am always the problem, it\u2019s never him.\nI try to bring this up and he just says he tells me thank you for what I do. \nI don\u2019t understand why his thank yous to me are enough, but mine aren\u2019t good enough for him.\nI\u2019m at a loss and anytime I bring anything up he shuts down, says he has to work on everything and then basically just ignores me. If I text him he says he\u2019s putting his phone on DND. \nI want to have a baby next year and I just don\u2019t see how progressing anything in our marriage is possible when we can\u2019t work through simple conflict. \nJust at a loss.\n\nTL;DR husband working on starting his own business, I feel like he doesn\u2019t appreciate what I do to help. When I bring up any sort of conflict he shuts down for days at a time and ignores me. Not sure how to work through this. \n",

Like an actual example of a behaviour, that he thinks is reasonable, that would make him feel appreciated.\n\nBased on that, you either have something to try, or a conversation to have about a reasonable compromise you'd both be happy with.\n\nThen do the same from your perspective. And again, be specific, use an example.\n\n\"The way you talk to me\" is not specific, it could mean tone, word choice, volume, etc\n\nSame process here as above, lay out what you think would be a reasonable behaviour to replace it with, and go from there in terms of the conversation.\n\nThen, give each other room and permission to fuck up. No one is perfect. And most people aren't able to flick a switch and change their behaviour overnight, so accept there'll be mistakes along the way as you both slip into old habits etc.\n\nAnd, when either of you does the new thing, even if it's not perfect, validate it.\n\nAgain, not when it's perfect. You're validating the attempt and effort.\n\nOvertime, the validation conditions the behaviour, and it becomes the new normal.\n\nMaintain this process, returning to as often as needed, for the rest of your marriage.\n\nSomething else I would add, is communication tends to suffer when it's about the person, not the behaviour, and when you speak in absolutes.\n\nSaying that you never support him etc garners the exact response it got in your post- you argued the facts od the matter, and brought up how that wasn't true. \n\nIt completely changed the topic from how he felt, to what the objective truth is regarding frequency of an action. \n\nAnd that's normal, because he communicated in a way where that's the natural response.\n\nSo instead of\n\n\"You never support me\" switch to \"when you do xyz I don't feel very supported\"\n\nThat's a statement of how he feels. There's nothing to argue with. His feelings are his feelings, and even if you think they're unreasonable, that just allows him to make the same argument back about your feelings at a later date.\n\nSo if that's how he claims to feel, then acknowledge it. Then look for the solution. (Note, again, see above- it's a reasonable solution, you both agree on. This is not giving him free reign to manipulate you into doing anything he wants if he claims it'll make him feel better)",

I'll genuinely choose death. \n\nI don't know him, so I can't be specific about how to make him feel safe enough to talk. But it may be a case of just having to start with him and his stance.\n\nLiterally just start by asking him how he felt, that you want to understand, and then just ask questions to get that specificity out of him, eg, can I have an example of what that would look like? \n\nAssume every word that's ambiguous (fair, more, less, even) will be misunderstood so ask for clarification.\n\nAnd leave it at that.\n\nUse that as the behaviour you're validating to begin with, and condition him that communicating leads to good outcomes.\n\nThen you bring it back to you, your feelings, your needs etc\n\nNow, obviously you don't have to do that. And it's definitely you putting yourself out for him, and it's totally one-sided to begin with. \n\nBut you can only control your own behaviour, so if you just wait for him to change then you'll probably be waiting for a while",

Like say your wife is leaving you and you have strong feelings for the woman, but yet you all still have sex and when you do have sex, immediately afterwards she showers and leaves (as in just sex only). No cuddling no pillow talk nothing. Just a cold goodbye. you wouldn\u2019t be affected by that whatsoever ? Especially if you want her back? \n\nCompartmentalization in this context would mean you wouldn\u2019t really care all that much despite your strong feelings.

She understood as time went on because we divorced when she was 3, and she is now much older. But because we divorced before it got bad, we stayed friendly and understanding that life is messy and court papers dont define our parenting. We got a 50/50 split and no child support. Never saw a day in court or met with lawyers to figure things out. We did need lawyers to explain the paperwork because NY makes it unnecessarily difficult to do it on your own. However, we did the bare minimum legally and sorted the rest out ourselves because it can be that easy if both parties want it to be easy.\n\nThrough it all, our daughter knows she is loved beyond measure in two homes she can go to whenever she wants.

Like AITA level bad. \n\nMy husband is feeling down for a few reasons. One of which is our friends are more like my friends that he hangs out with. In terms of like hobbies and things. I recommended he use facebook groups or go to sports games cause he was big into baseball. He had a negative response so i gave an alt suggestions. And again and again. I got to a point where i said it seems like suggestions arent making you feel better and before i could follow up with anything else, he said \u201cyeah.\u201d Which felt super dismissive. I told him he hurt my feelings while im trying to be supportive and I acknowledged that I was going about it wrong. Then he said he felt super unsupported the whole time. Which\u2026 sucked to hear. So now we both have hurt feelings and I dont know what to do about it. Obviously i want to comfort my partner. I want him to feel better, i want him to have friends that he feels connected to and have similar hobbies to. I want him to have, yknow? But i think my default way of comforting is not hitting the spot. It makes me wonder how many times i have missed the queue before where hes upset and im giving suggestions and its doing nothing for him. Or making it worse. Ir how many times he avoids confiding in me about his feelings because my type of comforting isnt actually comforting to him.\n\nI know a lot of this could be solved with a heart to heart between the twi of us. We will get there eventually, but both of us are sensitive right now and I would rather have some options or tools under my belt for the next time he needs support or when we do get to talking about preferences for consolation/support during tough times\n\nTl;dr: my husband told me i made him feel unsupported when i was trying to comfort him via advice and suggestions. How else could I try and comfort him?",

We have one little baby boy (6 months old).\nMy husband moved to the US 3 years ago, and I had to leave my beloved country, my family and friends, my work, and everything behind to be with him.\n\nAfter all these years, and all this love, I accidentally found my husband\u2019s Reddit account\u2014well, actually, it\u2019s not very \u201caccidental,\u201d as I looked into his phone because he lied to me about having another Reddit account (I don\u2019t know any of his accounts, but I knew there was something fishy). I know I didn\u2019t have the right to do that, and I\u2019ve already apologized to him for doing it, but recently he\u2019s been acting weird about our religious views. I found out through his Reddit account that he\u2019s an atheist and stopped believing in God while we were dating. But he never brought this up?\n\nThe most heartbreaking part is that he\u2019s been lying to me for years and years, and he was acting as if he were \u201cpracticing\u201d just to please me. I don\u2019t know how to trust him anymore. He has told a lot of lies already to cover other lies, and it\u2019s just\u2026 heartbreaking.\n\nI love him so much. He\u2019s the love of my life, and I can\u2019t imagine my world without him. And now we have a child!!\n\nWe talked about this, but I feel like I can never get over this\u2014and the trust??\n\nTl;dr: Found out my husband\u2019s been hiding he\u2019s an atheist for years.

Then one day you cut your hair short and died it a different color and came home to show him all excited and told him you loved it and asked if he did also. \n\nWhat if he hated it. As in truly thought it was the ugliest haircut he\u2019d ever seen. Would you want him to tell you? Be honest!! \n\nI guarantee that most good husbands would lie and say they liked it because their wife was obviously so happy about it. It wouldn\u2019t make him love you any less but they were lying to spare your feelings. \n\nSame thing as \u2018does this dress make me look fat\u2019. \n\nOr the other way around. Your husband say decided to grow a beard. He again was super excited, said he felt it made him look younger or more distinguished etc etc but you hated it. Would you tell him? \n\nWhat I\u2019m getting at is that all lies aren\u2019t created equal. \nThere are lies that are said out of love of another person, not wanting to hurt their feelings, and then there are lies that are said that meant to deceive someone because they\u2019re doing something wrong. \nE.G. cheating, stealing etc. \n\nHe\u2019s not doing anything wrong. His lie was to protect your feelings. \n\nLastly, and this is a very important question which you need to think long and hard about. \n\nIs it TRULY the lie or the fact that he is an atheist that you\u2019re bothered about? \n\nIf you knew he was an atheist when you first met him, would you have still married him or is having a religious partner too important to you?

We've been married for 10 years and have 2 kids. \n\n\nWe've been through so much together. We've built a life together. We\u2019ve always traveled together, had fun, made memories. Even when he smokes weed (which is illegal in our country), I never tried to stop him. I let him relax on our trips. I never complained. I always wanted him to feel free and safe with me.\n\nBut now\u2026 he's planning a month-long trip to Thailand. At first, I thought it was our trip. Then he told me he only wants me to come for the first two weeks. After that, he wants me to fly back home while he stays the remaining two weeks \u2014 either alone or with a friend. to \"relax and smoke\" This broke my heart.\n\nHe says he\u2019s been working nonstop for a year, and this is the only month he has off.\nThat he just wants to relax, enjoy his time, and be alone.\nBut the friend he wants to stay with is known for partying, smoking heavy, and messing around with girls.\n\nWhat hurt me the most wasn\u2019t just that he wants to stay longer \u2014It\u2019s that he wants me to leave halfway through the trip so he can spend the rest with his friend.\nAnd if his friend can\u2019t make it? He still wants me to go home\u2026 because he wants to be alone.\n\nLike\u2026 what does that even mean?\nYou\u2019d rather be alone in Thailand than with your wife of 10 years?\nAfter everything we\u2019ve been through?\n\nIt made me feel so replaceable.\nLike I\u2019m just there for the first part, and then I\u2019m no longer needed.I feel unwanted. Rejected. Like I\u2019m no longer part of his life, his joy, or his world.\n\n\nI tried talking to him. I told him how much this hurts me \u2014 how it makes me feel pushed aside and unloved.\nBut he says he did nothing wrong. That he\u2019s not doing anything bad.\n\nI love this man deeply\u2026 but I feel like I\u2019m slowly losing him.\nWhat would you do if you were in my place?\n\nTl;dr \nMy husband '38M' planned a month-long trip to Thailand \u2014 first half with me '33F', second half alone to \u201crelax and smoke.\u201d \n",

You just said he's been working non-stop for the past year and he only has one month off and you are offended and causing him more grief and guilt because he wants to spend 14 days by himself? Or with his boy or whatever the hell guys do when they are alone, who cares. I think you should be grateful you have such a hard working man that on his only month off, he's spending half with you, whether it's reluctantly or willingly, doesn't matter. Again, I'm on your side girl I'm not attacking you, I just think as women we need to be more considerate of our men. If you have been with this man for 10 years and you love and trust him , two weeks apart shouldn't be a big deal. If you're stressing about him wanting to have 14 days to himself or with his boys because they could do something bad and you're making it about you and your feelings and creating unnecessary issues and tension then maybe you're the problem. If you truly trust this man then what's the issue? Take baths, drink lots of tea, and find something to binge watch on Netflix for the two weeks he's gone. you'll be fine. We need to do better.

Also that he seems to dismiss her feelings just like that, is another point of concern.\n\nSo, without knowing more detailed info, it's hard to say what's going on or what you (OP) should do.\n\nIf he's getting alone time at home, ask further why he needs it in \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\udded specifically and explain (further) how this starts eroding the trust between you.\n\nIf he's not getting alone time at home...well, that's clearly something to work on. Also I'd suggest this as a compromise: wife stays the full 4 weeks, but during those weeks he gets a couple of days to (literally) be alone.\nWould that be an option?",

        "text": "\nSorry if it\u2019s a long read. I don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to about this. I could really use some advice.\n\nFor context, my wife and I have been together for 6 years and married for almost 5. We met at university and I\u2019ve had the best moments of my life with her. She\u2019s kind, smart, beautiful and basically everything you could ever wish for. However, recently she did something which put a lot of strain on our marriage\u2026\n\nOf course I\u2019m protective over my wife, but not to an insecure level. I don\u2019t mind her going out with her friends or having friends of the opposite gender. It\u2019s perfectly normal for working adults to engage with different people. She uses my phone, I use her phone. We don\u2019t hide things! At least I thought so. \nI use her instagram like once a month  (I don\u2019t have my own account) to check out some fan pages. I don\u2019t know why but I decided to check if she had hidden chats\u2026.and she did. When I questioned her about it, she deleted it immediately and denied that she had hidden chats.Now I\u2019m thinking wtf is going on. I told her that she\u2019s lying and that I\u2019ve already seen the swipe down for hidden chats which are password protected. She travels a lot as part of her job  (at least 15 days per month) and said it was one of her \u201cgay\u201d colleagues that sent a message jokingly saying that they should go skinny dipping the next time they meet abroad. She explained that the reason she hid it was because she thought I\u2019d get mad and insecure. This was after she already lied to me saying she didn\u2019t have hidden chats to begin with. I later pressed her on the situation again and she confessed that it was actually her that made the comment that they should go skinny dipping and not her colleague but says it was just a joke. My concern is if it\u2019s really innocent, why lie? And why hide it? The only reason for hiding it would mean she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nLately she\u2019s been super friendly and bubbly. More so than usual. And I\u2019m just confused because I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s just trying to be nice to make up for her \u201cmistake\u201d or if she\u2019s feeling guilty. All I want is to see their actual chat so I can get peace of mind. If it really was just a lame joke, I\u2019m okay with it. But I\u2019ll never know 100% because now I feel she\u2019s broken my trust by lying multiple times. \n\nAm I overreacting? What can I do to get peace of mind and stop stressing about this shit? \n\ntl;dr : found out my wife (who is a frequent traveler, for work) texted one of her male friends to go skinny dipping the next time they met abroad. She denied and lied multiple times before confessing the truth. She deleted the chats and now im seeking peace of mind and need advice. ",

If she says that she erased them then tell her you want the password. If she has nothing to hide, after her lies to you, then she can give you all her passwords. Her lies should cost her. Dishonesty is the doorway to full blown cheating. Do not let her by with the lie. Had she not lied I would\u2019ve thought she was just flirting, but erasure means it\u2019s more. Get into couples therapy to try to work through her dishonesty and possible cheating. \nDo not sleep with her, do not get her pregnant and detach from her until she proves her loyalty by full transparency. She lied. It\u2019s her job to fix this. Meanwhile, get an appointment with a divorce lawyer just to see where you are and what your options are since she may leave soon to be with someone else. You\u2019re not overreacting. The love bombing concerns me because that usually denotes dishonesty. \nThis can be repaired if you both are willing to do whatever it takes but don\u2019t let her gaslight you into thinking what you saw wasn\u2019t cheating. She needs to come clean and repair the trust.",

She called him every time she left the house to pick up dinner to go to the supermarket to go get her nails done to go get a massage when she got home from work.   Not to mention, she spent all day with him at work.    Transferring tens of thousands of dollars back-and-forth between them.  25 years just discovered a couple months ago. She\u2019s a narcissist.  I was the empath makes total sense.   It all started because I picked up her phone and she started crying telling me she wanted to leave. I\u2019m scaring her.  I just picked up her phone, my faithful, loving wife who nobody thought would do this to me. Nobody believe me.  I believe you\u2019re swinging if you get calls from random numbers in my town and then his town always right before lunch.   Best part is she told me it was an Uber driver one of them.  Found them on Facebook.  Gorgeous mother with three kids.  Uber driver, right. I was trying to find things to prove that she was innocent, but my gut just kept on telling me something\u2019s not right.  I filed for divorce a day before she did back in April.  Today I discovered thousands of dollars which you want from my bank account. She\u2019s going to the ATM multiple times a day returning things constantly. I think she might\u2019ve had a drug problem only thing that explains all the money.   Disclosure I used to have one that\u2019s how I know.  One minute phone calls with her coworker either there at affair or drugs  now I think it\u2019s both   She just keeps on popping up. I looked through my documents, bank statements, so I really have his bank statements and some phone records barely any phone records you get $1500 transferred to her buy some girl who she told me today she never did anything with her. She never transferred any money to her.  Then that $1500 goes right to her coworker.   I don\u2019t know what was going on. I know nothing all she tells me is I\u2019m crazy. I\u2019m losing my mind. I need to get over it. I need to move on. She did nothing wrong except delete one text I\u2019m 43. Have to start my life over again and we have a seven-year-old son\n\nMy best advice go with your gut. Don\u2019t let her know you\u2019re onto her or whatever you\u2019re doing  and stuff will get destroyed \nThe easiest thing could be to just ask her can I see your phone? See how she reacts. I will tell you a lot good luck. I hope you don\u2019t end up like me.",

        "text": "Ive (39F) always had a higher than average sex drive. My husband (38M) does not. I\u2019ve expressed my desire to have sex more often but I\u2019m generally met with resistance which doesn\u2019t feel good. The last time we were intimate (about 1.5 weeks ago) he lasted about 45 seconds. His strategy is to provide an orgasm through oral and finish inside of me through 45 seconds of penetration. I desperately need more time w the penetration. He says \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t work like that\u201d meaning he\u2019s unable to last longer but I truly do not understand why. I see that he tries to last longer by taking \u2018breaks\u2019 but it disrupts the rhythm- thus throwing my orgasm off. Is there anything I can do to help him????? He says to take it as a compliment but it only makes me fantasize about other men. Life is too short to get 45 seconds and I worry as we get older, it\u2019ll only get worse. The thought alone really saddens me \ud83d\ude14. Please help. \n\nUPDATE: My husband is what most would call a bit square (which I mainly love). He\u2019s not into porn, doesn\u2019t jerk off and spends most of his time working. When we met I was the third woman he\u2019d been with. He\u2019s just not super into sex which sucks. When we got married I naively thought with experience he\u2019d warm up and start to want it more. But. I was wrong. \nWe had a chat this morning and he mentioned he only desires sex from me when we\u2019re emotionally and mentally plugged in which is very feminine to me if I\u2019m being honest. With work and kids it\u2019s damn near impossible to have a Disney romance that leads to 45 second sex \ud83d\ude44. A few of you have good points about the possibility of having premature ejaculation. I\u2019m going to look more into this. \nAs for the mental connection requirement\u2026 guess I\u2019ll just buy another vibrator bc I\u2019m not motivated to be the perfect attentive wife everyday to be desired. Thanks for the feedback. \n\n\nTl;Dr: how can I help my husband last longer???",

He basically put me off of wanting to be intimate with anyone because I figured sex wasn\u2019t that enjoyable. However, it appears it might be more to it than differences in your sex drive. It\u2019s possible that he knows he has this issue and is afraid to even try more often because he doesn\u2019t want to disappoint.

Tell him its ok and you love him. Once that is established, if you have the resources, I would go to your PCP and explain the situation and make sure there arent any pelvic or prostatic issues. Another possibility is that this has to do with his lack of ability to control his pelvic muscles and possible anxiety. This can be discussed wtih a sex therapist and there are free resources on the internet that can be consulted. This does not mean that you do not have to get the sexual satisfaction that you would like as well. There are toys that can be used in the mean time that he can be a part of. I'm not shaming masturbation, but see if you can include him when you use the vibrator. On top of all that, I would ask him if there is anything sexual that he would like to do that he hasn't shared with you that he might be embarrassed or nervous about. Above all, being that this is in the sexual arena, you are going to get nowhere without implicit acceptance and non-judgementalism. It is very important that even though it feels like you aren't desired, it in no way means that you aren't desired. You probably have different ways in wish you express desire, you might think that sexual pleasure is a key part of desire expression while he might view working hard as a way to express desire. If you have the resources, a sex/couples therapist can be really helpful.",

        "text": "I've (35f) been with my husband (43m) about 10 years. We got married about 5 years ago. When we were dating I was constantly having doubts about our relationship and compatibility, but that might just be how my brain works? I was the same way in all past relationships. Always one foot in and one foot out. And then when those relationships ended I inevitably looked back on it and regretted letting them go. My husband is a good man. The best guy I've ever known. But we have our issues. I think I married him partially because I thought it would finally make me stop thinking about leaving him. i tried to leave him twice while we were dating, but both times I came back and was able to repair the damage. I was afraid I would leave some day and not be able to repair it. So I convinced myself to go all in and really commit. The day after we got married I was thinking about calling the minister and asking her not to submit the marriage license we had just signed. The doubts haven't stopped. I think about leaving every day. He knows I think about leaving some times but he doesn't know how intense it is. We are at a difficult spot right now. He has been unemployed for 3 years. And we are living on my income. We don't have kids so it's doable, but not as comfortable as I'd like to be. I'm pretty resentful at this point but I'm trying to be kind. He is looking for work, but honestly not very hard. He likes not working. Anyway, my point is there are things going on right now that give me more reasons to think about leaving, but truthfully I've been thinking about it far before any of these problems. Part of me wants to leave him and be on my own and free to explore and date other people. Mainly women (I'm bi and miss that sometimes). I feel trapped sometimes. When he is sad or angry I feel no compassion but I force myself to be kind to him. I'm not very attracted to him anymore, but I can coax myself into feeling aroused enough to have sex. But another part of me knows he is safe a good and loyal. He loves me so much and would never hurt me. When I'm feeling depressed he takes care of me so well. We have so much in common and I love his sense of humor. I took a vow to be with him in good and bad times, so I feel selfish for thinking of making an excuse to leave just because times are less good right now. Ugh sorry this is so long and boring. I'm so sick of being in limbo. Does anyone have any sage advice or relatable situations?\n\nTL;DR: will I ever stop obsessing over whether I should stay or leave? I always have one foot out the door.",

                "body": "It sounds like thinking about leaving a lot might be a you problem, ie get therapy.\n\nBut then you throw in that he's bludging off you and hasn't worked for three years. That's pathetic. He needs to take a junior job or move to another city to get himself into work. Unless there's some reason you haven't mentioned? Isn't he embarrassed to be taking your money?\n\nIt's possible you're not into being with one person forever. That's a reasonable way to live. Marriage isn't your only option.\n\nYou haven't really said what you're fighting about that makes you want to leave all the time. Do you feel like upgrading to a better partner? Or getting away from specific annoying traits? Or just want to be single? Or you don't like having to accept his flaws like he has to accept yours?\n\nI think this requires further self analysis",

                        "body": "Thanks for the reply. You are probably right about talking to a therapist. I've been in therapy on and off for many years and am kind of sick of it, but I could probably try again. Your comments did give me some perspective though. My husband and I never fight. We hardly ever disagree. We are both pretty passive people so if one of us gets annoyed or angry we tend to just shut down until it passes and then talk about it later. I think what is difficult is that there is no energy or passion in our relationship. I used to think it was a good thing. That he was stable and safe and predictable. That our relationship was friendly and kind and dependable. I read some of the things others write about fighting and cheating. We just aren't like that. I think I'm realizing our relationship is more like roommates who care about each other and occasionally have sex. I guess that's not exactly unique for a long term relationship. I want more but don't want to risk losing what I have.",

I wouldn't bother with anyone less than a masters degree. If you get off on the wrong foot and the don't ask enough questions, they can end up not getting to the root of the problem. You should walk away from every therapy session thinking wow, I never would have realised that if someone hadn't pointed out to me. In my opinion. It's OK not to want to do more. Plus it's so expensive. I'd recommend you listen to an audio book, seeing as you've already identified are theme. \n\nYou both cope by avoiding conflict. People choose this option because it makes them feel safe. Perhaps you have a belief from childhood that fighting means you're going to break up, and that happy couples never fight. It's good that you guys at least talk about the issue later, if not at the time. Perhaps you could discuss separately that you'd like to try to reduce the time between the conflict and the resolution? If you usually wait 24 hour, how about waiting just a few hours, same day? Or if you are waiting a hour, challenge yourself to discuss it five mins later.\n\nDon't worry about the peoppe fighting and cheating in others. Most people aren't dealing with cheating. You shouldn't feel like your relationship is ideal just because cheating isn't an issue. \n\nI perceive you have a scarcity mentality on the relationship. Like, it's more important to have a mediocre relationship than no relationship. Or to lose your relationship. This is really holding you back. You're not being vulnerable or brave, to try to make the relationship more honest or exciting, because your fear that you might have a conflict and split up or damage the relationship far exceed your opinion that taking a chance to spice things up (or feel energised and adored or whatever) might work and might help and might bring you closer together. I'd encourage you to think about those ideas. Answer for yourself, and be very honest - what is the worst thing that could happen if I ask for what I want? He might say no, and that might hurt. He might mock me and embarrass me and make me regret asking. He might shame me for being too sexual. You've got a better idea than i do of yoru relationship dynamic and patterns. Feel free to share. \n\nI highly encourage you to work on your current relationship. We bring our problems to the next relationship anyway. And quitting or running away solves nothing. But doing nothing to improve and just tolerating it achieves nothing either. Taking no action and being passive and afraid is a choice, even though it feels like it. If you do ntohitn, because you're afraid, you're still choosing to be afraid. If you try soemthing new you might get a good outcome or a bad outcome. If you don't try anything new you will get more of the same. When did you lose yoru excitement for life? When did you lose your bravery? \nPicture yoruself on the nursing home at 80. If you look back at yoruself not dealing this, what regrets will you have? What advice do you want from 80yo you to take a chance on making a change? \n\nIt will be hard. It will be scary. \nBut as I always say - nothing worth doing was ever easy. \n\nGood luck, you can do it! What's the worst that could happen?",

He said he hasn't felt any urgency around finding a job because we aren't at risk of homelessness. Which is why he hasn't been trying that hard. I told him that makes it my responsibility to put pressure on him by threatening to leave or something. I didn't threaten to leave- just explained that. The only reason it isn't urgent is because I am here paying for everything. He applied to a job last night. We'll see what happens. \n\nI guess I didn't realize how upset I really am about him not working until we started talking about it last night. I think I identify as someone who rejects gender stereotypes and so I was probably pushing away my feelings about it because it feels too close to expecting my husband to \"provide\" for me. I would probably be fine with being the sole provider if I made a lot more money, but I don't make enough for us to just depend on my income forever.

You're not asking him to provide for you. You're asking him to provide for himself!!! Carry his own weight.\n\nTo me, not working, for the reasons he's given, is a massive red flag.\nMy sister is much old than me, 50s. She's recently divorced after 30 years. Her husband refused to work for 14 years. At times he'd say well I need to run the house for 4 kids (teens). Or that he was too depressed to work. When she moved out, he got a high level professional job within weeks.\n\nDo you know the term \"enabling\"? Don't be embarrassed, I do this too, and find the habit hard to drop. Your hubby will step up and start working if you don't earn enough, or don't give him access to money. I know that's hard to cut off, as you likely have joint accounts.\n\nI want to give you a reality check: he's using you.\nThat's not to say he's a totally bad person all the time. But he's taking advantage of your good nature.\n\nSometimes, to cope, we start making excuses for our partner in our mind. That whatever dumb reason they've given us is okay. Because they make it sound OK. One way to give yoruself a santy check on that, if you're stuck under their spell, is to imagine you're a little girl describing your dream husband. You'd probably be listing off magically things, like he takes you for icecream and on fancy dates and to Disneyland haha. You sure as hell wouldn't be listing off traits like he uses me for my money, he makes up fickle justifications for his bad behaviour, he let's me struggle financially to carry the household expenses alone, for no reason.\n\nYou don't have kids yet. It's very unlikely this is worth saving. I've never heard \"I haven't got a job cos we don't need the money\" from someone who the relationship was worth reconciling with.\n\nYou sound like a lovely person, and you have a long long life ahead of you. Imagine if he's still like this in 50 years. Now imagine he's worse!\n\nYou can clearly afford to leave, you're already supporting two people! Don't be generous when leaving. That's enabling. It's not your job to get him somewhere else to live or help him move.\n\nDon't be afraid of what the future holds or that you might not find someone.

For a man who\u2019s addicted to porn and sex, he refuses to be intimate with me. There\u2019s no sex or physical intimacy, nor is there flirtation or play of any kind (when I try to tease or play, he calls my actions \u201cimmature\u201d and \u201cembarrassing\u201d). He\u2019s cold and distant, sleeps in a different room, and doesn\u2019t speak kindly to me (refuses to say \u201cI love you\u201d because he claims words like this don\u2019t mean anything).

He has obsessions (like video games) that consume him and my poor SIL is just his roommate.",

In addition to everything I\u2019ve listed here, he\u2019s also extremely stubborn and inflexible. He becomes obsessive over random interests; he\u2019s very book smart and articulate. From what I know (which is not much), I think he demonstrates lots of these characteristics. \nHow did you find out your SIL\u2019s diagnosis?",

He hasn't been formally diagnosed though - I just have the suspicion that he has ASD based on my research and his 'quirks'. Granted, I'm no expert, and not my relationship, but I looked into it trying to understand the situation better and support my SIL.\n\nThere's no way I'd broach the hypothesis with her though - she once asked my and my wife's thoughts about marrying him before she did so, and we both were honest: among other things -he's not a family-oriented person and you're from a big/involved family, not sure how that's going to work out. She exploded on us with excuses and that we aren't welcoming enough. Sure enough though, it's been an absolute calamity. \n\nI actually feel better and get along with them better under the presumption that he has ASD than I did when I thought he was just a huge jerk. \n\nThat isn't to say I would be able to be married to someone like that, and it is beyond me how my SIL stays in the marriage, but we support her in whatever decision she wants to make. He has isolated her two states away from any friends or family, and now they have a kid. She is basically a single mother in the same home as her husband - he has very, if any, interest in a child and it drives him crazy if the baby makes any sort of mess or noise. So that's a little tricky seeing as kids are messy and noisy by default.",

I\u2019ve experienced this in my relationship too\u2014sometimes I\u2019ll remind myself of this possible diagnosis and I\u2019ll find myself giving him more grace when he hurts me. I\u2019m just struggling to understand if that\u2019s the right thing to do. I certainly don\u2019t want to make excuses for him because it\u2019s not acceptable to treat a spouse the way he treats me, but at the same time, maybe some of this is outside of his control.

Since i told her i didn\u2019t want to tell the others as they wouldn\u2019t react well.\n\nSo i told them the engagement is called off but we are still secretly engaged, only his side knows since they are not judgmental. also think age might be at play here - im 22 and graduated college two weeks ago, and he\u2019s 27 and has loved ones that are engaged and married. \n\nanyway. we are trying to figure out places to get married on campus since i live near there. but bottom line i just don\u2019t feel very comfy with some aspects of this. i told my sister, she reacted very poorly and kept threatening to tell the family about this and told me he has BPD and i need to get back into therapy to figure out why i said yes and all this shit, telling me i need to tell my psychiatrist since my mood stabilizers aren\u2019t working (i\u2019ve told her in the past i was misdiagnosed bipolar I but no one believes me), and my friend literally got nearly blackout just to be able to call me back and talk about this. \n\nlike i feel like me being in love is doing something wrong. i don\u2019t know. literally his side doesn\u2019t give a shit and they\u2019re happy for us but my side acts like world war three just broke out. and i\u2019m moving in with him before my lease ends in july lol my dad said it\u2019s too soon in the relationship to live together but little does he know\u2026\n\nyeah idk long winded rant im just looking for a bit of advice on where to go from here. i dont really care about bachelors party all that shit or the wedding just want to marry this man. he is truly my everything and my forever person. \n\ntl;dr i got engaged a week after meeting a man in person, we texted and stuff before that tho",

He is older, not old enough to make me think groomer but proposing to someone he just met as they prepare to enter the real world is little sus. His family being totally okay with everything is a little more than odd. Concern is normal so if this is something that doesn\u2019t make them bat an eye, what else has he done that was just as life changing and impulsive?

Would track her location and call/go find her if she went a different route. Would scream at her until she was cowering in a corner if she said she would be home at a time and was even a few minutes late.\n\nMy point is, you dont need to get married right away to enjoy life together. Go on the dates, spend the time getting to know this person. Yes, people can still change later on but you'll have a better idea of this person you are wanting to spend your life with.\n\nBest of luck",

You need to get to know each other first.  After a few disagreement and earring living and vacationing together, after learning who has bad habits at with messes and cleanliness, drinking smoking gambling, relationship pasts cheating being cheated on attitude power , personality. Shy bold outgoing talkative too quiet, boring, education, class manners etc . \n\nThese things change relationships quickly so that\u2019s why you get to know each other . Divorce is not a piece of cake. Make it a long engagement, develop history,  live together to see if you are comparable / compatible .  See how finances get managed see it is a partnership or a dictatorship first. And use birth control so you don\u2019t end up with a child whose father abandons them, and you have no money to support yourself then have to live with parents, or on the street or in a motel in assistance for  the next several years.  I\u2019m not saying that won\u2019t happen after a longer time together, but at least you\u2019ve been though the learning curve hopefully before you have a child . \n\nAsk people about marriage many will be happy to tell you how things change to the most difficult times after the honeymoon when reality sets in you can\u2019t walk away without consequences in a marriage or as a parent, you can only do that with a boyfriend or fianc\u00e9. And get through it without a serious financial burden. Be smart, don\u2019t rush into a marriage that has not been well planned because you want to plan the wedding itself and avoid the truth about the marriage part  weddings are a lot easier than marriages trust me!",

He has been supportive more than ever and I have been able to see him as a equal partner. The issue still goes in sex. I was matching him early in our marriage but after feeling used and violated by him early in marriage then just ignore and unheard early on led to a general loss of interest in that department. The first 5 years I actually felt disgust and resentment when ever he attempted to initiate. After we got better we had a child and there Even more libido drop. So from multiple times a day like 5 days a week in the first year to right 1 or 2 a month in year 2 to 4 to let's say 1 ever other month we finally in year 10 and 11 are about 6 times a month. And I know this since I've been keeping track. But sometimes I still feel like revolted by his actions. My husband just insists on hold my breast.  Randomly trying to touch them and pretend it's a game? Or when he tries to be the big spoon he presses his penis on my butt. Or like attempted to press his hands over the vulva. I absolutely hate it. Despise it. I tell him to move or leave me a lone but he always tries. I am wtiting this since I am annoyed that he attempted again. Early in year 2 or 3 I called him an octopus do to always feeling like a hand was out to fucking grab or touch.  me. I just am annoyed and general put off. I tell him I yell it and he still does it. So since yelling talking calmly pleading doesn't work. Any advice on what to do to get it through his head? \n\nTl;Dr SO not respecting my body and feeling tired and not knowing how to get him to stop. ANY advice? ",

Because if a man doesn\u2019t get sex from his own wife, or isn\u2019t allowed to enjoy her body, or is made to feel guilty and ashamed to desire his own wife\u2019s body then he starts questioning the reason he gave up being single, committing so much into a marriage, and providing. \n\nDo you want to remain married?

        "text": "My husband and I hadn\u2019t spoken for a week. When we finally talked, things felt a little better, and later that evening, we had sex. We\u2019ve been struggling with a lot of marital issues and are trying to work through them, one step at a time.\nThat night, during sex, I didn\u2019t climax\u2014which isn\u2019t unusual for me without my vibrator. During our week of silence, I had ordered a new toy: a rose vibrator with a small penis attachment. After reconnecting, I told him about the new toy and said I wanted to use it with him.\nHe mentioned that he hadn\u2019t done anything sexual during our week apart, and I was honest and told him I had used the toy once. When I brought it out, he asked to see it. It was dark in the room, so I figured he just wanted to check the size of the attached penis, which is actually smaller than his.\nBut just as I was about to use it, he handed it back and said he was jealous of the toy and wished he had something like it for himself. That completely killed the mood for me, and I stopped. I asked him if he wanted to talk more about it because I wanted to reassure him\u2014there\u2019s truly no comparison between the toy and him.\nHe responded by saying he didn\u2019t think I even liked fake penises, which kind of confused me. It felt like there was a lot of emotion behind what he said, and I\u2019m not sure if he felt insecure, hurt, or just caught off guard.\nWe\u2019ve been together for 16 years, and during that time, I\u2019ve always preferred using a vibrator during sex\u2014either while he\u2019s inside me or while he\u2019s using his fingers. I\u2019ve communicated this with him before. So when I brought that up again, I said it politely, just trying to explain what works for me.\nHe responded by saying, \u201cI tried to use the pink dildo vibrator one you had and you said you didn\u2019t like it.\u201d That had to have been around 15 years ago, and I could barely remember it. But I told him that I was probably just uncomfortable at the time. I vaguely recall that it hurt because he was pushing it in too deep, and instead of explaining that back then, I just shut it down.\nSince then, though, we\u2019ve used toys plenty of times\u2014mainly for clitoral stimulation\u2014so it confused me that he was bringing up something from so long ago like it defined our whole dynamic. He apologized and asked if I wanted to continue, but by that point I just wasn\u2019t in the mood anymore. I told him maybe we could try again tomorrow.\nI couldn\u2019t sleep. I was on my phone, assuming he was about to fall asleep shortly like he usually do right after. But after about an hour, I noticed him reach for his phone, and maybe 30 minutes later I started hearing sounds that made me think he was masturbating.\nAt first, I said nothing because I was honestly shocked. He\u2019s never done that beside me while I was awake without talking to me about it first. It\u2019s not that I have a problem with him masturbating\u2014I know he does that on his own sometimes, and that\u2019s totally fine\u2014but this felt different. The way he did it, so close to me, without a word\u2014it just caught me completely off guard.\nEventually, I asked him, \u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d and then, \u201cAre you masturbating?\u201d He said yes. I didn\u2019t say anything else\u2014I just turned over and tried to go to sleep. As soon as I did, he got up, cleaned himself off, and got back into bed.\nAs if nothing happened. I finally asked my husband if he didn\u2019t think it was weird\u2014what he did\u2014and he said, \u201cI told you I was horny.\u201d But that\u2019s not true. He never said that. My husband has a pattern of rewriting situations to sound more positive or harmless than they actually were, especially when something he did hurt me or made me uncomfortable. We\u2019re working on that, but it\u2019s still hard.\nAnyway, I felt something I haven\u2019t really felt before with him: scared. Then disgusted. And honestly, completely turned off. It was the most turned off I\u2019ve ever felt. I told him straight up that it felt really weird to me\u2014that it creeped me out. And instead of listening, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re going far left, like you always do.\u201d That hurt.\nI told him I couldn\u2019t have the conversation in that moment. He left the room angry.\nAnd now I\u2019m sitting here wondering\u2026 am I wrong for feeling the way I feel? What are some reasons he did that?\n\nTL;DR: We had sex\u2014he finished, I didn\u2019t. I went to grab my new vibrator (with a penis attachment), and he got jealous, so I didn\u2019t use it nor orgasmed. Later, while I was awake and on my phone, he started watching porn and masturbating next to me without saying anything\u2014something he\u2019s never done in our 16 years together. It really shocked me. We already have a lot of marital issues, and this just added more weight to it.",

We had talked several times about having two kids before we reached the age of 30 and building a family and what we wanted to accomplish beforehand. I asked him several times if he was sure he was ready to get married. Well couple weeks after now he\u2019s been depressed and keeps saying he\u2019s upset about things he\u2019s never gotten to do before meeting me like try specific drugs, go to raves, big parties, wanting to travel the world, and sexual acts he knows I\u2019m not going to be willing to do. I\u2019m upset as I feel as though he lied to me and that he is not at all ready to be settled down and married. \nTL;DR was he not ready for marriage or am I overreacting ",

        "post-author": "EnvironmentalDig1072",
        "text": "Me (31M) and my wife (30F) have been married for 8 years now. We have two kids (ages 5 and 7). Everybody around us thinks our life is so great and special, but I often fantasize a life without my wife. \n\nTo be completely honest with you, I can\u2019t really pin one thing that has made me feel this way. I think it\u2019s a collection of things over the past years. We had some pretty serious family drama that came from a complete misunderstanding. Even though my wife admitted she realized it was a misunderstanding, she wouldn\u2019t even allow me to talk to my mom or brother without blowing up on me. She held on to this grudge for the better part of a year before she would let me talk to my family again. That was 100% the start of the resentment. \n\nThere\u2019s things my wife does that I consistently ask her not to do. Like for example, she will manipulate the kids by saying stuff in front of them that she shouldn\u2019t. Like \u201cplants\u201d thoughts into their head of an idea that they wouldn\u2019t have thought on their own. Giving them their way and overriding me as a father. I have zero respect from my kids UNLESS my wife asks me to step in. It\u2019s only when she\u2019s past her breaking point that she does that. Another thing is I\u2019ve asked her since we found out we were pregnant with our first child to not yell in front of the kids. If we need to scream and holler, we\u2019ll go to the next room. Yet, any little thing that doesn\u2019t go her way she\u2019s screaming. When I politely ask her to calm down in front of the kids? It\u2019s only worse. \n\nIntimacy? Pffffft. I\u2019ve begged my wife to initiate sex. Show me you\u2019re interested. I WANT TO FEEL WANTED. Because as of now, sex isn\u2019t anything special. It\u2019s bust a nut and roll over. There\u2019s no spark, no connection, no emotion, nothing. I have to convince myself that I want to have sex with my wife. Otherwise, I\u2019d rather just lay down and go to sleep. It\u2019s gotten to a point that I\u2019ve started looking at porn again (which was only before I was in a relationship with my wife). The first 5 years in our relationship, I never even thought about porn. I had this woman that I loved that felt much better than my hand. Now, I\u2019d rather just get myself off when I feel a need. \n\nI\u2019ve recommended counseling on 3 different occasions now. This time last year, I had these exact feelings and I told my wife about it. I told her I was seriously just contemplating divorce. I told her I loved her, but I wasn\u2019t in love with her. She reacted very much like a wife who doesn\u2019t want to lose their husband. But nothings changed. It got better for the first couple months, but it all went right back. We even went to a marriage retreat with my Chaplain Corps from my Guard base 2 weekends ago. We argued and weren\u2019t physical with each other at all. 2 paid nights of a marriage retreat and all we did was argue and avoid sex. \n\nI don\u2019t want to admit I don\u2019t love my wife, I truly do love her and what she\u2019s done for our family. But I can\u2019t tell you as of today, I am not in love with her. I feel trapped and miserable. I feel like I\u2019m not at my full potential, because I\u2019m so unhappy. I used to go to the gym and was pretty physically fit, now I\u2019m just a skinny-fat, lazy dude who does nothing. \n\nTL;DR - I\u2019m in a miserable marriage with a wife who doesn\u2019t care about my needs (both emotionally and physically) and I\u2019m fed up with feeling trapped and not to my potential.

If you keep being the same person, keep reacting and acting the same in the relationship you are continuing to do the things that helped create the relationship dynamic that caused you so much frustration.\n\nIf you want different results you have to do something different, not ask your partner to be more considerate of your feelings.",

That\u2019s it. And ya know, I understand that\u2019s a wife reaching out to her husband. And that might would lead to more intimacy, but having the drive to do so when I feel like I\u2019m ignored in the feelings I\u2019ve shared with her doesn\u2019t really make me want to show an abundance of affection.",

It was about something that had previously happened and my mom always knew about.\nThey were already past that.

My mom called my wife and went off on her and through the same phone call, they realized it was a misunderstanding and my mom apologized. Well my wife wasn't ok with that.

Which in turn is making me miss the mark on her expectations.\n\nDo you see how this is going down the same cycle as it has gone down every other time?\n\nYou don't feel like she is meeting your expectations, so you are less motivated to meet her expectations, which in turn is going to give less, and you give less.... and sooner than later you are back to where you started.\n\nDon't do things for her if you are going to have expectations tied to them, unless these are concrete, tangible, mutually agreed upon agreements. This means more or less there shouldn't be many expectations in your relationship. That is how you break the cycle.\n\n  \nIf you were doing things for your wife because you wanted to, felt it was reasonable, and had the time and energy to do so, and expected nothing in return this doesn't spiral.\n\n\n\n>I feel trapped and miserable. I feel like I\u2019m not at my full potential, because I\u2019m so unhappy. I used to go to the gym and was pretty physically fit, now I\u2019m just a skinny-fat, lazy dude who does nothing.\n\nAs I said in my first comment you can change all of this, and need to, regardless of your relationship status.\n\nYou can look at this as a chicken vs. egg scenario, do you feel trapped and aren't thriving because your marriage sucks or does your marriage suck because of all the other things? Doesn't fuckin matter.\n\nYou feel trapped\n\nYou feel miserable\n\nYou aren't happy\n\nYou aren't living to your full potential\n\nIf your wife turned out to be just imaginary all of these things would still be true.... actually, maybe even more important, if your wife wasn't in the picture it would be clear who's responsibility it would be to change all of these things in your life, its yours.\n\nHaving a committed partner doesn't change your responsibilities to yourself\n\n  \nIf you handled all of this stuff for yourself and didn't expect your wife to help carry the load for your feelings about yourself what do you think would happen? \n\nDo you think you being happier, you being more interesting, you being less frustrated, you being less dependent, you taking more initiative around the house, might spark some interest from your wife? That is usually what happens, but don't expect it to happen because if she doesn't regain interest and you two can't navigate a better way forward it won't be a problem because you still end up with the latest and greatest version of you. It is a no lose situation for you. The relationship gets better or you take your best self and move on",

But also that you need to take the lead on things if they are crucial to you. \n\nBetter or worse can get better if you learn to enforce your boundaries and do the hard thing. Sometimes a professional is needed to make clear the consequences of inertia. \n\nAlmost every couple goes through a major slowdown and taking for granted in intimacy unless it is prioritized. Which can be hard with young children. Are you doing things to ignite romance and rekindle the spark? Or have you resigned yourself to \"Its the way it is and nothings ever going to change?\"\n\nSorry you're feeling like this and certainly her actions and in-actions are causing you pain. Will that pain be lessened enough when you're apart from her and your kids (at least half the time)?\n\nLasting relationships take a lot of work and a willing partner. If you let the resentment guide your actions, you may regret it. Maybe not. \n\nI'm sure you've done a lot of the math, but maybe see a lawyer to get a true picture of what divorce truly involves, then see if keeping your family whole is worth putting in one last hard effort?",

Random butt slaps, forehead kisses, holding her hand, night time cuddling, all the things she was asking more from me. I\u2019ve never been one to be lazy and not help her around the house. The only thing she said I could do differently was being more intentional. So I did that and then some. She got better about the things I told her I didn\u2019t like for some time, but it slowly trickled back in. And I tried to catch it early on and just give her a \u201cbabe, this is exactly what we talked about before\u201d and she would get better temporarily. Eventually, it\u2019s just come back to a regular occurrence. It gets to the point where me saying anything to her doesn\u2019t do anything but make her defensive. Then it\u2019s an argument, then I\u2019m ignored for an entire day. So why even try?",

        "text": "My wife and I have been married almost 20 years and have multiple children.  I have had a stressful but successful career and educational path to get where I am, and my wife has stuck by me. Unfortunately, she has been and has become exceedingly difficult to please and live with. She is a perfectionist and takes pride in in what she does, and she does those things well. She is someone that can never admit that she is wrong. I didn\u2019t know what the term gaslighting was untill about a year ago and realized that this is a manipulation tactic that she uses all the time. I thought that I was going crazy. She used to routinely give me the silent treatment and wouldn\u2019t even look at me sometimes for two to three days. I have no problem admitting when I am incorrect but this is next to impossible with her. She has told me at times that we feel like we are roommates living together and not actually in love. One time during a seeming innocuous disagreement and when I tried to get her to admit that she was incorrect, she told me that I made her feel like she wanted to commit suicide, which was shocking. Another thing she would do to me is not tell me something and then use that information against me in an argument, for example, something relatively benign would be going on in her family and she would say you have no idea the stress that I\u2019m dealing with, I would respond if you would tell me then I would know. Ultimately, after that, I demanded that we go to therapy. She was reluctant at first, but went. When I brought up those suicidal thoughts to the therapist, she said that she didn\u2019t actually mean it. She told me that it feels like she\u2019s walking on eggshells around me, but it\u2019s actually quite the opposite. When I tried to do a load of laundry and wash something, she blew up at me and said that she already washed it and somehow I was attacking her in the by making her feel that she wasn\u2019t doing a good enough job when I was actually trying to help. I suggested that we go back to therapy but it\u2019s out of the question. We only went for three sessions. Her mother has severe anxiety and depression. Recently one of her relatives got divorced after a very brief marriage. Of course she blamed the other person and not her relative, initially she said the most positive things about her now ex relative, but once she discovered that they were getting divorced, she railroaded them.  This is what I am dealing with and I am feeling stuck.\n\ntl;dr  what should I do??",

Then she will give me the silent treatment, etc. I told her this was very troubling to me and then I would like to speak with her and reconcile so we can move forward and this is something I brought up in therapy, but unfortunately therapy was short-lived.  I only recently discovered what a narcissistic personality is and that is her.

He\u2019s always been more of a dad to her than her own father. \n\nWe went to dinner- I ordered a drink first \u201cRoot beer\u201d. She ordered a water, and I thought, \u201cThis is promising\u201d\n\nWe had a nice time and went home and watched a little tv. She was in the kitchen for a little bit, but didn\u2019t seem \u201coff\u201d at all. \n\nWe didn\u2019t really talk about it- I did t want to open up a conversation because we were both so exhausted. \n\nI moved my stuff back into the bedroom, and at 9:00 we both went to bed and I felt a sense of peace. \n\nShe is going the \u201cthe change\u201d and often gets hot flashes. I woke up to find that she had gotten up in the middle of the night and was sleeping on the couch. \nAs I was leaving for works I checked her box of wine- just to give myself a warm and fuzzy, and it felt way lighter than it had yesterday. I looked at her wine glass on the drying rack, and it was wet inside- which means she probably had a hot flashes and decided she needed wine. \n\nWe\u2019re supposed to go out for karaoke with friends tomorrow night and all I can think about is how I\u2019m going to get out of it. \n\nTl;dr Confronted wife about drinking.

        "post-author": "Glittering_Flow_1964",
        "text": "This is a lot to unpack with a lot of details I think are pertinent. Please stick around! I can\u2019t afford a therapist so I\u2019m putting myself out here as much as I can while remaining anonymous.  \n  \nI (38F) have been married to my husband (42M) for 17 years and together for 21. We don\u2019t have any children. I am not straight (I tried labeling it with no success). We live with family and pretty much always have. My main love language is acts of service and his is physical touch. I am on anti-depressants (have been for over 10 years) and tried getting off of them once, and was quickly instructed by the attending physician to start them back up. I have been on more than one and this one has the least amount of side effects that I can deal with. I WFH and he is a stay-at-home husband (I support this 100% - it\u2019s not up for suggestion and only important for small details below). We have almost nothing in common, other than we are both homebodies.\u00a0\n\nThe past five or so years, things have been wonky with us. We seem to be riding the same rollercoaster ride over and over again. Our most recent \u201cdiscussion\u201d (it wasn\u2019t really a fight, or an argument, in the typical sense) is really bouncing around in my mind, while I try to find a way to catch it.\u00a0\n\nI can\u2019t say that our differences aren\u2019t only sexual, but they definitely are high on the list. He NEEDS intimacy like I need nicotine. Initiating has always been a sore topic in our marriage. You could probably count on just two hands how many times I have initiated over the years. I tried explaining it that I am not given any time to really want it because he wants it all.the.time. Recently, it\u2019s turned into more \u201cI do xxx and yyy to show I\u2019m trying and you do nothing and I don\u2019t feel like this marriage is fair.\u201d (We firmly believe in our marriage that \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cequal\u201d are NOT the same thing.) I, of course, immediately went on the defensive (because a) that\u2019s how I was raised \\***insert MAJOR eye roll but it is what it is**\\* and b) see example of me doing it about intimacy \\***again, another eye roll**\\*.\u00a0\n\nThen, the conversation just would not leave my brain! I got to really looking back at our marriage to see where I have failed. Or maybe could have just done a little bit better.\u00a0\n\nI have failed my marriage. I have failed my husband. My sweet, kind, takes on everyone else\u2019s problems as if they were his own, gorgeous, saint of a husband. He is the ONLY person who I can truly be myself with, in all the ways. I know that he has my back, even if he doesn\u2019t agree with me. He has been so patient with me. I know I am not easy to be with, and I try to make sure to make it known that it\u2019s known. While I work during the week, he takes care of the house, me, runs errands, does it all. Even though he really doesn\u2019t like leaving the house. He tries to take me to do things I\u2019ll enjoy even if he won\u2019t. Movies, family events, etc. He said that I need to step it up, basically. I don\u2019t know how. He has no interest in being intimate at the moment (which I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t understand). I try to do things that I see need to be done that he hasn\u2019t gotten around to yet (like dishes, or trash, or folding laundry that he spent all day doing), but then he says things like \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that. I was going to do that.\u201d I still do them, but when I say something like \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. I got it\u201d, it feels like he thinks I\u2019m doing it just because we had a \u201cdiscussion\u201d recently. I think, personally, that it takes away from it all. From the meaning behind it, which is \u201cI see you. I see all you do. I can do this to help, if even just a few minutes to do some dishes.\u201d I know I need to do more. I don\u2019t know how.  \n  \nHow can I show him that I am in this? That he is my priority, not me? I have been a lazy wife and I need advice. I give up when there is resistance\u00a0\n\nTL;DR \u2013 I have been a lazy wife and needs advice how to be better for him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0",

                "body": "Lets forget genders here and just say your are A and he is B... A is suffering from depession and is struggling to survive... why that might be well A in this post has identified a major issue that cause maybe people to shut down or become inconsiderate or entitled to their partner's love and labor, that is the unresolved childhood traumas.  The eye rolling and defensiveness is two of the 4 Horsemen that Gottman talks about these are Contempt and Defensiveness, they are the signs of a dying marriage.  What A has described also the rollcoaster or wonky of issues in the marriage is call the DANCE again by Gottman and its the sign of fights never ending and when fights don't end it breaks down the marriage and the reason the fights aren't going away is because you aren't being present and listening to your partner, this goes for A and B in this situation.  These are major red flags in a marriage and they need to be addressed, now I get A has talked about not being able to afford therapy and I understand but there is no reason you can't afford free videos on youtube or book even used books to help learn tools to better you marriage.  \n\nRight now I feel like based on the post B does not trust A and A does not trust A and this is a major issue.  IF A wants to save the marriage A needs to focus on addressing their inner wounds and child.  You can't fix a broken relationship if you are still broken and not trying to fix yourself.  \n\nAs for B you are doing good but struggling to communicate and that has a lot to do with their inner child and childhood trauma which is in the form of people pleasing.  This is a major issue and one of the reasons B is short and feeling alone and unloved because they have pleased and pleased to be given nothing in return over time.  B sounds like they are intimacy starved and that is a major issue but also B needs to stop trying to fix A and focus on addressing B's issues.  This people pleasing is a learned skill from someone in his past and they need to addresss it.  Which I will be honest as a people pleaser the highs of making my avoidant or inconsiderate partner happy is a big rush.\n\nSooo what do I recommend you two do.\n\nAs a couple there are some quizes and tests out theer I want you two to take to help you two figure out more who you might be and why some of the issues are going one 1) ACEs test, this is about trauma 2) Personality Test DISc I think its called or something like that 3) Attachement Style Test 4) Apology Language Quiz 5) BDSM Quiz 6) Love Theory Triangle Quiz\n\nI would start first trying to understand you first by taking these quizes and tests but understand as you change they will change as well just like Love Languages your results will shift as you meet the needs and move forward.  Once you two have taken them separately I would hope you two would sit down together and share the results and compare them and talk about the answers in not a way of judgment but of understanding.\n\nMaterials I would recommend \\*Gottman Institute\\* basically they have a ton of free youtube videos and podcasts and everything else as well you can do for free to learn.  Right now a major issues as well in your marriage is that you two are using the old tools that used to work but no longer do so you two need to got to the Home Depot of marriage and individual help and pick up and learn new tools for your marriage.  A great book which I talk about a lot on here is 7 Principles to Making Marriage Work by of course Gottman.  This book is for reading and has questions at the end which is really good to do and I recommend you two do them together, specially the chapter about the DANCE and 4 HORSEMEN, you can buy new but you can find them really cheap online or at a local library.  If you are lucky you might find a book with someone else's answers and see how other people also have a screwed up marriage.  NEXT for you A is by Marriage Helper and its call PIES of Attraction, this is not about just attracting your partner but also attracting yourself to yourself which it seems you struggle to love you.  Marriage Helper also has a ton of videos and podcasts that are amazing in helping.  NEXT is learning about love theory and how intimacy isn't just sex but intimacy is a lot deeper than B or maybe A thinks it is.  NEXT would be watch some of Dr John Delony about starting a new marriage within your marriage about how to wipe the table clear and creating a new marriage together, he also has a great book about Own your Past Creat your Future, great read.  Pair app or any other kind of apps that allow you two to play games together.  I know Gottman had one call Card Deck which is questions to help you two be intimate with each other.  As for other books for B and A I recommend, It Didn't Start With You, Cleaning Up Your Mental Mess, Hold Me Tight, The Body Keeps Score, The Road Bakc to You Study Guide, Come Together.",

It\u2019s a gift. He knows this, and cherishes it. \n\nI am suggesting that you learn to desire intimacy\u2026for him. Enjoy his feelings of connnectedness with you. Many people rediscover a joy of being together more often through a little effort. It may be awkward at first; again I suggest you be aware of his energy and what that energy says about how he feels about you. \n\nTo the liberal women that will think me a pig, with all due respect, you aren\u2019t a man or a high libido woman. And you will tell me I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to not desire sex (for yourself); you\u2019re right I can\u2019t imagine it. But I also can\u2019t imagine knowing what will make my spouse fulfilled and purposely avoiding it out of my own selfishness.",

There is nothing saintly about being a chameleon, constantly changing to be what you think your partner needs, just to try and get what you want.\n\nHe is dishonest, manipulative, and extremely selfish, maybe he isn't these things all of the time but more than often enough.\n\n  \n\n\n>  \nThat he is my priority, not me? I have been a lazy wife and I need advice.\n\nYou should be your top priority, just as he should be his top priority, thats how you create healthy relationships, its the only way to prevent someone or both people from getting screwed over. If he is your top priority there is no one to advocate for you, instead you just have a husband who does a few chores and makes you feel lazy for supporting both of you, a husband who does a lot of what he does simply because he hopes it will lead to sex and validation.",

        "text": "Long story short my husband(38) and I(36f) have been having a tough time for the last few years. We get into the same cycle of fighting trying to figure it out and then just going \u201cback to normal\u201d without any real resolution just for it to go back to fighting a few months later. We have done couples therapy which wasn\u2019t great the person didn\u2019t seem to want us to actually find resolution. I have been in individual therapy for a few years and she really supports me and just wants me to be happy no matter what. \nBut at this point I don\u2019t know what to do. We have been fighting again and it\u2019s just exhausting. I try to express how I\u2019m feeling and what I need in our relationship and I\u2019m met with defensiveness and \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cyou do it too\u201d as a response to most things I say. When I ask him to tell me the things he\u2019s upset about from me I get \u201cnothing I\u2019m fine\u201d when he very clearly isn\u2019t fine or he just tells me all the same things that I have said I\u2019m upset about. I have tried to be soft when I bring up issues, I\u2019ve tried to be direct, I\u2019ve tried ignoring the way I feel and it\u2019s all just led to us being unhappy. I know I\u2019m also part of the problem, I\u2019m a recovering people pleaser and have anxiety so when something does come up I tend to turn into myself to try and fix the problem myself so that I can avoid conflict. It\u2019s not that I give my husband the silent treatment it\u2019s just that I\u2019m a bit more quiet and have a hard time talking about anything because my mind is so consumed with how I can fix the situation without causing more problems. And it very much has not been working, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be asking people on the internet for advice. I have been trying to stop doing that because he doesn\u2019t like it and I have apologized that I still do it. And I also tend to say things in a mean way when I\u2019m angry, even tho they are true I say them meanly because I\u2019m hurt and angry. I am not proud of doing and I absolutely apologize when I do it, I know it\u2019s not ok and I am really trying not to do it and I have gotten better at not doing it. \nI\u2019m exhausted. I want us to be happy I want us to have fun I want us to be affectionate. I want to be soft and sweet and caring. Instead I don\u2019t want anything to do with my husband most of the time because I don\u2019t want to be asked for anything and I don\u2019t want to hear his attitude and I don\u2019t want to fight about anything. \n\nSo for couples who have tried a separation did it help? Did it give you the space to come back together or did it just cause more distance? Would you recommend trying it? I\u2019m at a loss. Thanks for any help. \nTl;dr husband and I fighting tor years thinking of a separation, needs advice from people who have done it. ",

And the goal of individual therapy isn\u2019t to make the choice that\u2019ll let you be happy no matter what. We can\u2019t predict the future and happiness is too unreliable to pursue. However, what you can strive for is to make choices that align what your beliefs and who you are at your core. A very basic example would be like, I might be happy staying in bed instead of going to work, but aligning my values and long term goals, I\u2019ll go to work regardless of how I might currently feel. \n\nIn regards to the \u201cnothing I\u2019m fine\u201d, honestly, everyone has a right to privacy and timing of when they\u2019d like to share something. We can\u2019t force or control it, and to what you\u2019ve already noticed, it just makes us more unhappy trying to prompt something from someone when they\u2019re unwilling. If that\u2019s his response, you can always let him know \u201cokay, I can understand if you don\u2019t feel like talking about it right now. But from being with you through the years, it seems like something is on your mind. Whenever you\u2019d like to share, I\u2019m happy to listen, just know I\u2019m here with you.\u201d \n\nAt the end of the day, we all want easy, and what you\u2019re looking for is the end result of working on relationship dynamics, accepting what won\u2019t change, letting go of control, changing what you can, setting realistic expectations, getting on the same page, and sliding the foundation of your relationship again. The affection, love, softness can come back, but as you pointed out, there are things that aren\u2019t working, and if they\u2019re not working but repeatedly done, apologies won\u2019t fix what\u2019s breaking. So then, it\u2019s about finding what will work. For example, if you know you tend to say things you regret when you\u2019re angry, as soon as you notice the feelings coming up, communicate to him \u201cI\u2019m getting really upset. Let me take a minute to myself and cool down so I don\u2019t say something I don\u2019t mean. I\u2019ll come back when I\u2019ve cooled off a bit and then let\u2019s address it.\u201d \n\nFind what works for the two of you. Don\u2019t throw up your hands and just say, we have these issues that we\u2019re stuck in. The things we\u2019ve tried haven\u2019t worked, but I just want happiness, affection, and warmth back. \n\nThere\u2019s always a choice to do differently, and we do our best with what we\u2019ve got.",

He started a new job and I filled out all of his paperwork for it. He needed a new resident card and I did that for him. Taxes. Car registration. Doctor appointments. Me me me. Even to go on vacations, I don\u2019t pack his bag but I have to explain to him what to pack. He doesn\u2019t know what bank account we use. No idea what bills we pay. Has only purchased shoes once for our kids in 15 years and never purchased clothes. \n\nI do everything. I also work full time, am the breadwinner and we have 2 kids, 15 and 10. \n\nWe don\u2019t go on any dates at all except once a year anniversary dinner because we have no one around to watch the kids. His family all fight with each other so can\u2019t call any of them and his parents are no condition to stay with our kids. My family are all great, loving, helpful but they live 4hrs away and he refuses the idea of moving out of this area to be near them. (His family all live within 25 mins). \n\nNow to the intimacy issue. All he cares about is sex. I am drowning, I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m overwhelmed and all he can talk about is sex and how he doesn\u2019t get enough of it. Today he started a conversation saying he wants us to find ways to connect again, to get to know each other again. I said that was a great idea. He then asked if I still love him and I said yes. And his next question was \u201cdo you still get h0rny\u201d. It felt like I was talking to a sex bot, no joke. Major ick. \n\nAnd the thing is that let\u2019s say I do give in to him daily, it does NOT change behavior. He doesn\u2019t suddenly get so happy and motivated that he takes things on. \n\nIdk what I\u2019m looking for here. I\u2019m just so exhausted and the absolute last thing I want to do is sleep with this man. At this point, him finding another woman to sleep with would be equivalent to me finding someone to clean my house. Like super helpful and one less thing for me to worry about. \n\nTl;dr I\u2019m drowning in this life and my husband only cares about sex ",

This thing happens over time and we get blinded by love and all that.  It\u2019s not your fault.  It\u2019s not his fault either exactly - at least not in the sense that your marriage is where it is.  He\u2019s not doing these things for himself because you\u2019re doing them.  You have to stop.  Here is how you fix it.  Explain to him that sex feels like caretaking because that is all you do for him.  Make him food, make his appointments, wash his clothes, pay his bills, make him cum, pack his lunch, fill out his papers\u2026. Etc etc.  Sex is now just another thing he needs from you.  He needs to take on everything you do for him that he can do for himself.  There is NO REASON he can\u2019t do those things.  Once he is at least doing that, AND starts showing you that he can pull his weight in the joint responsibilities you may start to feel differently about sex.  But he will have to wait.  It\u2019s not either of your fault that the dynamic got this way, but sex is not something you owe him and if you\u2019re not into don\u2019t do it to make him happy.  It is destroying any true intimacy you have left.  You will (if you don\u2019t already) resent him so deeply you\u2019ll never come back from it.  He is right, he does deserve love and affection because everyone does, but that is something that has to be reciprocal in an adult relationship.   He is asking for you to give him the kind of love and affection that a parent gives a child.  He love and care for our kids because they are our children - we expect nothing in return.  That is NOT how adult relationships work.  You must both participate or neither will.  If you can tell him this and he has a wake up call great.  If not he may need to be turned loose on his own to figure out how to be an adult without you so that he can be an adult partner to you.  My husband and I went through some of this (still working on it) and together we made some big changes that have helped a lot.  We\u2019re in therapy too and it\u2019s getting better slowly.  I don\u2019t know if your situation is salvageable but if you want to talk about it more you can send me a message and we can chat about it.  I know it\u2019s hard when you see a lot of \u201cjust leave\u201d - obviously if you wanted to just leave you would.  There\u2019s hope but it\u2019s not easy.  I hope you can find a way to improve the situation before you lose yourself, your health or your sanity.  You do need to put those things first because no one can pour from an empty cup and just like your husband you deserve a full cup.",

        "post-author": "358NOW",
        "text": "My wife made a friend at work and the two hit it off great. They started hanging out all the time, and i would in fact joke about how the friend was going to \"steal her away\" from me. The friend would come over, go to the movies with us, to shop, to get food, would come over and have \"art nights\" and hang out, sleep over (in the same bed), and she herself endlessly brought up things like \"we should take a BDSM test\" or \"i like to dress Nerdy Slut style... which of these do you think looks better on me\" (yes, this was to me).\n\nFurther clouding all of this, she talked about how she didn't even send a bikini pic to some guy and when she did he didn't talk to her again... she said she felt insecure, and she shows me and my wife. We both compliment her and say she was super cute and he was a moron. But she had just said before that she had never felt comfortable enough to show such a pic to someone... then she showed it to us like it was nothing (which is fine but confusing).\n\nNow bear in mind, that was all going on this past weekend when she slept over (as she does most Saturday nights since they hit it off). This Sunday however, she goes shopping with my wife without me (as i was working) and she says that i was \"sliding into her DMs.\"\n\nNow here's what ACTUALLY happened... On Mother's Day weekend when she came over and slept over, we had been talking about a particular political and socio-religious issue. i said i would send her the article i wrote about the subject for a newspaper online (i am an author, journalist, etc.), as when i had mentioned it, she said it sounded interesting and she would like to read it.\n\nSo i go on my Instagram app, see her little circle story thingie at the top and click on it to go to message her the link. Her story is a pic of her as a little kid with her mom and i emoji <3-reacted to that like i would and do to any other friend on there. I then send her the article. End of story... or so i thought.\n\nA few days later my wife is texting me at lunch with her and she isn't answering texts from me for the whole time. So knowing she barely had any lunch time left to answer, i send a message to this mutual friend (i thought) and said something like \"hey stop trying to steal my wife away and tell her to check her phone haha\" or something like that.\n\nI don't see any read receipts to any of this so I just assume \"oh well, she must just be active on Pintrest, which i'm not on.\" I thought nothing more of this until she brought this up privately to my wife and characterized it as \"creepy\" and the like.\n\nIs it just my on-the-spectrumness or something? None of my friends think any of this is out of the ordinary, especially considering how friendly and comfortable she was - again, even staying over in the same bed with us (non-sexually). That didn't seem like someone i shouldn't send a message to of an article i said i would send to them during a conversation when they said \"i would like to read that.\"\n\nWriting to people i am friends with - men and women alike - in IG, FB, whatever, is how i normally communicate with people more than text or email. I am honestly at a loss for how this could have been viewed as inappropriate or creepy or anything but what it seemed to be presented as - just regular ol' communication with someone i know IRL and felt (apparently wrongly) was my friend.\n\nCan anyone let me know your thoughts on this?\n\ntl;dr I DMed Wife's Friend From Work Who I Thought Was Also My Friend. She Hangs-Out-With, Shops and Sleeps Over In Bed With Us. I didn't send anything flirty or dirty or anything, just normal stuff from conversations IRL. Is this inappropriate?",

The inappropriate thing is her sleeping in bed with you and your wife every weekend and getting to comfortable being part of your relationship. I can\u2019t stress this enough- you need to put an end to all of that. If your wife wants to still go shopping with her or to the movies, she can meet her there. I would tell your wife that you no longer want her in your home because you are uncomfortable with someone in your home that is accusing you of doing inappropriate things. Never ever be alone with this girl, not even for 5 minutes, because she could say you made a pass at her or touched her inappropriately or something worse.

She should not be sleeping in the same bed with you and your wife unless there is some open sexual relationship going on between the three of you having understandings. But no. If what you said is true, then she is making issues for some ulterior selfish reasons. Likely to get closer to your wife for her own romantic and sexual desires. Or set you up to become single to come at you. IDK.\n\nBut you need to set clear boundaries going forward. How this friend can not stay the night, specially in your shared marital bed. How there can not be any sexual conversations any more, and use how she spoke on her looks and shared a provocative photo with you and your wife. She can no longer make jokes about \"stealing your wife\" and other disrespectful acts as such. Yes, they are disrespectful if she chooses to use inside jokes you all three have made against you as a personal attack. \n\nBut right now, I think you need to consider a harder stance of her. As in she is cut out of both your lives. That you need to consider telling your wife that the degree of lies and misleading acts she has done makes you not only not trusting of her in her motives, but fear she is a at risk person. And even say it clear to your wife that you feel she may have secret feelings for your wife and saying things to start seeds to create issues for your marriage. How you never had a issue of such before her, and now she has made issues you both never felt before. \n\nJust like you need to face it, your wife may need to as well. Which is more important.

You see it throughout our childhoods, how we turn entire social groups against one girl, based on the ostracism of one \"alpha\" girl. It's gross but it's very real. That is what she has done to you wife IMHO. Your wife may think she doesn't buy it but because the \"friend\" got to her with her version of events first, she set the narrative and everything you say is always going to be a defensive response to that. \n\nThe \"friend\" knows this and that's why she did it. By being \"defensive\" you look guilty. That is what narcissistic people do. They don't do this by accident, they have it down to a science. This woman knows exactly what she is doing and let me guess, she plays totally innocent and demure? lol You don't even have to answer, I know the type. \n\nYeah, when the photo reaction and the article came makes no difference at all. The fact that she is trying to focus on that as a \"gotcha\" shows not only that she is desperate to keep control of the narrative, but that her entire argument is as flimsy as her integrity. \n\nTell your wife to get a new friend or get a new wife.

        "text": "I didn\u2019t have my first relationship until 28 (virgin until 26), but I eventually found someone and got married within a year of dating\u2014partly motivated by visa issues, though she did have her own H1B sponsorship.\n\nShe cheated on me within the first week, but admitted it about a month later. I blamed myself a bit\u2014we hadn\u2019t explicitly defined boundaries early on, and my inexperience didn\u2019t help. Instead of walking away, I tried to set boundaries that were already too low to begin with. Over time, she resisted most of them\u2014like cutting off contact with exes or being consistently honest.\n\nOne ongoing fight was about a \u201cfriend\u201d she kept messaging. Even a day after our honeymoon, she reached out to him again, which really pushed me to the edge. I threatened divorce, and we started therapy. To her surprise, the therapist sided with me more often than not, and we made some progress\u2014especially around boundaries, honesty, and mutual respect.\n\nWe also went through her quitting nicotine and weed\u2014both extremely difficult phases. Things have somewhat stabilized since, and we\u2019re better aligned now on some values. But we still argue, sometimes escalating to shouting or even brief physical outbursts. I\u2019ve had to lock myself in the guest room or leave the house just to calm things down. But then things return to \u201cnormal\u201d for a while. When it's good, it's good\u2014but I no longer trust the stability.\n\nNow, I find myself wanting something else. I\u2019m less attracted to her, fantasizing not even about someone new, but about being alone. I hesitate to make vacation plans or open a joint bank account. I think about divorce often.\n\nJust last night, she went out for a \u201cdance session\u201d but turned off GPS sharing. I got suspicious. When she got home, her eyes were pink, and she brought takeout even though she had already cooked. I confronted her\u2014she showed texts and timelines\u2014but eventually admitted she had lied: she just went out to buy weed and chat on the phone.\n\nI don\u2019t even care that much about the weed itself. It\u2019s the lying. Her past weed use (daily, even during workdays) severely affected her mood and our relationship. She\u2019s improved a lot since stopping, but now she\u2019s lying about it.\n\nSo here I am, wondering: **at what point do you call it quits?**\n\nWe\u2019ve been building something for nearly 3 years. There\u2019s been a lot of pain (mostly on my end), but I\u2019m not na\u00efve enough to think someone new wouldn\u2019t come with their own challenges. Still, the constant lying and emotional turmoil exhaust me.\n\nI don\u2019t fantasize about someone else. I fantasize about peace. About being alone. Kids are no longer on the table for me. She\u2019s said before that I\u2019d have to sue her to get a divorce\u2014we likely wouldn\u2019t separate amicably. I don\u2019t have much money for a lawyer, but thankfully we have a loose prenup, haven\u2019t combined incomes, and split most expenses.\n\nI think I\u2019m just... done. But part of me wonders: is this just the hard part of marriage where pushing through is what makes it meaningful? Or am I clinging to something that was broken from the beginning?\n\n**TL;DR**  \nGot married quickly due to visa reasons. She cheated early, I stayed and tried to set boundaries. We\u2019ve had serious trust issues, constant conflict, and ongoing dishonesty, especially about weed and exes. Therapy helped a bit, but problems persist. Now I'm emotionally detached, often fantasizing about being alone, and unsure whether to push through or walk away.",

He\u2019s in the military and we have gone through deployments & he is currently deployed and I was able to go visit him for a weekend recently. \n\nA little background, before he left we had been struggling a little bit with our sex life for a few months. He had testicular cancer when he was 27 and had chemo/surgery. He recently had lab work done and his hormones are all over the place. He got put on Clomid but stopped it after 2 months when he got the smallest side effects. When he gets home he says he going to go back and get it figured out so he can overall feel better.\n\nBut it\u2019s been going on for months\u2026 we have sex like once a month if that. It really hurts me because I feel like he isn\u2019t attracted to me anymore, and also like he doesn\u2019t care about me. I think my needs matter too and he just doesn\u2019t care. \n\nWhen I went to visit him recently we had sex twice over the weekend (more than I thought we would) but he finished super fast obviously and didn\u2019t even care to finish me the second time. \n\nWhen I got back all of my friends were like omg did you have a lot of sex and I was just like yeah (haha not)\u2026 I just feel like we are really disconnected and I\u2019ve told that to him multiple times before he left. \n\nHe\u2019s a good person and a great friend, but I just don\u2019t feel sexually attracted to him like I used to. When we first got together our sex life was great, but honestly since we got married it\u2019s gone down hill. Idk what to do. I love him but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m IN love with him anymore if that makes sense. I often wonder what life would be like if I was single or with someone else who actually desired me. Am I a bad person? I know his hormones are messed up but also I still feel like he can make an effort to make me feel wanted, and he doesn\u2019t. \n\ntl;dr - I love my husband but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m IN love with him anymore.

But this is the \u201cbetter or worse sickness or health\u201d part of marriage. \n\nYou both need to get in couples therapy. He needs to hear your feelings and you need to hear his. It\u2019s not that he isn\u2019t attracted to you. It\u2019s like you said - he has some very real, chemical imbalances going on that you need to be with him for. However, his health should be the absolute number 1 priority- not sex. You need to want him healthy before wanting sex. Sex can be the outcome of him becoming healthy. His hormones are everywhere - he needs to try and figure that out if possible. It\u2019s extremely important you two figure those out together. Those hormones affect everything from depression to sexual drive. Being IN love comes and goes with pursuit. If someone does not pursue as heavily, it\u2019s easy to feel like you aren\u2019t IN love. \n\nYou\u2019ve been married 2 years. He\u2019s having a health problem. Help him solve it, get healthy and go to couples therapy together. \n\nOnce all his hormones are sorted and if sex isn\u2019t happening.

It seems like before him being diagnosed yall had an active steady bedroom life and now not so much. Most men have pretty high testosterone levels and his hormones fluctuating may be making his libido lower.\n\nLike I said your feelings are still valid, I would have a talk with him when he gets back and let him know how this is affecting you, like truly affecting you. Let him know that you want to feel craved and wanted from your husband and you want to work on this together. Maybe a sexual therapist or marriage counselor would benefit y\u2019all and give you the tools you need to navigate during this time .\n\nHe definitely needs to take the time to ACTUALLY take his meds to see if it helps him because doing so may help level out his hormones. \n\nMaybe try reading some books about men and their sex drives or books specifically catered to navigating through the tough times of a sexless marriage/ low libido husband.\n\nI really wish you all the best!",

I coach all of their sports, volunteer at school, and am otherwise very attentive. My lifelong dream to be a dad. \n\nIn the last two years I've lost, to untimely and unexpected deaths: my aunt, uncle, two grandpas, and this year, my only sibling - my brother. \n\nI feel like I'm barely hanging on after the loss of my brother. Our mom died when I was 20 after a long battle with addiction and mental illness. My brother was everything to me having been through that upbringing together - 100% call it trauma bonded. We raised each other, and as soon as we could - we left home together at 18 and made our way in the world. No money and no plan, just each other. My aunt and uncle stood in as parents to us, and now they're all gone. \n\nLosing him has taken something from me that the loss of the others did not. The grief has surprised me because I've dealt with a lot of losses, but his death has affected me so much deeper. Like a part of my entire being is now gone. I think about him every minute of every day - except when I'm sleeping. I sleep with headphones in just to drown out my thoughts when I do awaken in the night. I cry every day - and I'm not much of a crier - thanks childhood trauma. \n\nThat said, recently I've been self-medicating with non-tobacco nicotine, mostly pouches. I know I shouldn't, but I do - it provides a sliver of relief. My wife is beside herself about it - treating it as though it's equal to drug and alcohol abuse. I respect her, I understand the concern - I'm just trying to keep it all together and I don't really want to go on anti-depressants. Talk therapy hasn't helped - I don't want to hear about how resilient and special I am to have beaten major odds to have the life that I do. Such flattery doesn't matter to me, because the person who did it with me - is now gone. \n\nWe're not religious, and I do drink alcohol, not much - just socially at a BBQ, workplace happy hour, etc. I don't use it to drown my sorrows and don't drink anything during the week, not even wine with dinner. \n\nWhat should I do here? Part of me wants to say leave me alone about it while I pick up the pieces of my soul, but I love and respect her so let's hear it. \n\ntl;dr - I've been struggling after the loss of family, notably my brother, and self medicate with nicotine - which my wife is highly upset about.

I'm not saying a big chunk of your life didn't just get taken away, but my guess is more than that it exposed other large holes in your life.\n\nAs far as the nicotine, let your wife freak out and get her emotions out, but only once or twice. You heard her, you respect her opinion, you just don't agree with it and further conversations are only validating the appropriateness of her reaction.\n\nFinally your lifelong dream may have been to be a father, but that doesn't mean that just being a father and husband is going to make your life fulfilling.

Most people here are eager to jump on the holier than thou bandwagon, but I understand that this is an extremely difficult period for you.

In the grand scheme of things, people have done much much worse to cope, from alcohol abuse, gambling, to spending all their money and going into debt, to self harm. So please be compassionate to yourself. \n\nYour wife is worried that it could lead to negative health effects. I think she needs to lay off any judgement until you can have time to grieve and consider harm reduction, to abstinence if that's something you want to do. \n\nSome people, and I stress some people, need psychotropics to get out of the dark pit of despair, along with therapy. There are many new ones out there with less side effects, but it requires patience to get to the right type. \n\nMedication, therapy, exercise and meditation also helped me when I was grieving my brother\u2019s suicide, the sudden death of another brother, my cousin, uncle, then grandparents deaths. At one point, I was frozen - I couldn't care for myself or anyone around me. My husband didn't nag me about my drinking, but I knew I had to cope another way. People don't get it unless they've been through trauma and loss. Maladaptive coping mechanisms are sometimes all that is known. I sought trauma therapy when I was in a better place and doing well. I had to take time off work to work on myself, but it allowed me to be the person I wanted to be. Wishing you all the best.",

You certainly aren\u2019t doing any of this to hurt her or your children, you\u2019re just trying to ease a pain that doesn\u2019t ever go away.

I re-started smoking (after I'd quit for 7years) after my MIL died from cancer and I would sit on my back deck and just chain smoke until my throat hurt. Mainly in the evenings because I didn't want to call someone and talk about it. I didn't want to be in the house. I didn't want to BE in my LIFE. I didn't know what to do with myself. I worked up to being more addicted than I had ever been when I quit the first time. I smoked for five years before I (just) quit again in November. \nSo even though I hypocritically turned to nicotine myself, I recommended trying not to rely on nicotine if you can help it.\nI realized it was comfort and peace I was after- and sitting there breathing in and out looked (and felt) less like suffering with a cigarette in my hand.\nBut you need Something mindless to take the edge off. (Like a Game on your phone?, a hobby or some show or book series to binge. Learn how to make chain mail from wire hangers) something to distract your mind and use your energy. And likely (especially if nicotine helps) you DO need something to medically calm you that doesn't have risk of addiction or abuse. There are many different SSRI subtypes and they can be combined to help you with fewer side effects. It takes a while to find the right combination- so don't give up. \nIf you can practice breathing or grounding techniques, it can help. The best advice I have for you is to find a grief support group. I wish you peace and comfort today and for the coming days.",

I smoked for 20 years, and I have vaped for the past 15 or so. I don't see myself ever giving up nicotine 100%.\n\nI get not wanting to do talk therapy in general, but I would strongly encourage you to find a grief counselor (someone specifically focused on grief therapy) or a grief support group to process your losses. No one can understand what it feels like to lose a parent or sibling until they actually go through it. However, a grief specialist will know how to help you work through your feelings. My best friend saw one  after losing both parents within a year and she told me later that it saved her life\n\nI lost my dad a year and a half ago, so I have at least some understanding of part of your loss, though it's nothing like the grief hell you're currently residing in. I'm so sorry for your losses.\n\nI would also encourage you to reconsider going on anti-depressants. I have battled depression since I was 11 years old, and there have been more than a few occasions where anti-depressants were the only thing keeping me alive. During relatively stable periods, they keep me from sinking into the black hole of doom and allow me to function. \n\nJust think about going on something like Wellbutrin. As an added bonus, that drug is often prescribed to help people quit smoking:) It has never impacted my nicotine cravings, but it may work for you and make you feel better at the same time. \n\nWhat you have been doing (nothing) isn't working as far as getting you through your grief. Please consider my suggestions or other ideas people respond with. At the very least, it can't hurt to try something different. \n\nPlease take care.",

My little sister and I have that relationship. Did your brother have a family of his own? Maybe spend some time with them as well and friends.

        "text": "EDIT: I can't change the title, but it should read, \"I confronted (poorly) my wife about her drinking. She is focused on the wrong thing. What do I do next?\"\n\nI posted in here previously, and I am back with an update.\n\nI have  intended to talk to my wife for the last three weeks, but there has always been an issue, plus, I'm not sure that me talking to her alone is going to get the point across.\n\nShe had a couple glasses of wine last night, and I got tired, so went to use the restroom, and realized it needed cleaning- so I cleaned the toilet and went to the other bathroom.\n\nWife went to bed while I was cleaning (I only took a couple tenures to clean our ensuite toilet, and I went to use our spare bathroom.  This all matters.\n\nIn the few minutes of me cleaning the bathroom, and using the spare bathroom, wife had fallen asleep, woke up, and assumed that it had been quite some time.\n\nShe went into our restroom, and started sneezing and coughing- she is sensitive to smells- so the bleach smell got her coughing.\n\nI got annoyed because the toilet solution hadn't had any time to work, and I told her I was annoyed. She responded with some kind of incoherent statement about it, and I assumed she was drinker than what she was (Mind you, this isn't a huge leap since she gets really drunk multiple nights a week)\n\nThis is when I got upset. I asked her if she knew how many nights this year she hadn't had a drink. no response (The answer is 1). I told her that I couldn't handle her drinking and getting drunk all the time. That I've been in a near panic for 2 years, and that other people have been commenting on it. I said I don't like going down to our basement bar anymore or entertaining because I have to watch her, and the few times I haven't, other people have commented and said that I should take her to bed before she passes out at our bar. I also told her that she needs to get her drinking under control.\n\nI raised my voice (I know it was wrong), and she kept trying to spin the conversation, and I finally said, \"I'm done. I'm sleeping in the guest room\" I took my phone and watch charger, and my CPAP, and went to the front bedroom. She offered to sleep on the couch, but I said, \"No\"\n\nI got up this morning and she was sitting up awake on our love seat. I told her that I was sorry for raising my voice, and sorry about how I approached the topic. I also said, that I was genuinely worried, and that I have visions of picking her up off the floor, cleaning up messes that have happened as a result of her drinking, and I am exhausted from worrying about her.\n\nShe said, that she was up all night trying to figure out where she was going to go because I said, \"I'm done\".  She said that she assumed it meant our marriage was over.\n\nShe knows that my entire being is wrapped up in her. I told her that I meant that I am so done being in a state of panic over the drinking. That I want to spend the next 50 years with her. I just worry that we won't have that because she drinks so much.\n\nI reminded her that she weaned herself off of some heavy duty pain meds because she didn't like how they made her, and she was worried about her liver only to replace it with alcohol.\n\nI told her that I'm not trying to be her dad- I am her husband and I promised to be with her good times and bad. As her husband, I feel a responsibility to help her protect herself- and I know she feels the same about me.\n\nI know I went about it wrong, but I am not sorry that I said something, I just wish I did it better.\n\nNow, I'm worried that she will turn this into a marriage conversation in order to redirect... She always seems to have an excuse that points away from the alcohol.\n\nSorry so long.  This is fresh, and I need a place to vent my worries, fears, and frustration.\n\ntl;dr Wife seems to be deflecting. The way I talked about her drinking didn't help",

If she thinks you\u2019re just saying words, she will keep going and assume she doesn\u2019t need to stop because you\u2019re not going anywhere anyway.  She has to know that her choosing alcohol will also be a choice to leave you and other people she cares about behind.  My guess is you don\u2019t really even know how much she drinks when you\u2019re not there.  You mentioned others having noticed. Are these friends and family members willing to do an intervention with you\u2026see if the embarrassment wakes her up to needing help?  Another option is to make a bet with her.  If she can be 100% off of alcohol with no cheating for 2 weeks you take her on a vacation or similar.  It\u2019s not about bribing her but more about showing her how far she has fallen into addiction and how hard 2 weeks is in reality.  She won\u2019t make it 2 weeks without cheating.  One of my close friends ended up divorcing his wife because of her alcoholism.  They had a child with a brain condition (healed thankfully) and she turned to alcohol to help her cope.  Eventually she couldn\u2019t stop.  He tried lots of stuff and made the bet I mentioned. She didn\u2019t even make it a week but said it didn\u2019t count because there was a neighborhood cookout and she didn\u2019t want to be left out.  Eventually one of his kids (16) asked him if he would throw all the alcohol in the house out because he didn\u2019t think mom could stop.  That was the straw\u2026he told her she either had to get help that day and stick with it or it was over.  She couldn\u2019t stop so he took the kids and left.

When I was in a place where I was drinking every night (and feeling like crap), I finally downloaded an app called \u201cSunnyside,\u201d which prompts the user to track their drinks (via texting) as part of an overall weekly drinking plan. It also has the option to connect you with an online community and to have live conversations with a coach if it will help you. Forcing myself to face the volume of my drinking allowed me to start adding dry days. And when you first break that cycle, the anxiety and dependence also start to dissipate in my experience. Maybe she\u2019s the type who can take this approach and help re-route her drinking more so toward it being mainly or just social. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve (mostly) managed to do. The tracking really helped to put in perspective that I DID have a problem. If she agrees to at least start tracking, it may well spark a change in her behavior.",

Our hearts walk away from an addict before our bodies do..maybe that will help her realize where she is in her personal addiction. You screaming at her wasn\u2019t really AT her..it was at the monster that has ahold of your wife. \nGive yourself grace as the other poster mentioned but start preparing yourself..give yourself the tools you need to help yourself through. Saving you is killing me:loving someone with an addiction by Andrea Seydel was a gentle reminder of how my feelings/actions and thoughts were starting to revolve around his addiction not leaving room for much else. On the plus side,whenever I left the book lying around..it spoke about the elephant in the room without having to udder a word.\nI hope you can make it through this with her and come out stronger than before but remember you cant drag them to the finish line kicking and screaming,this is her choice. Wishing you the best of luck.",

        "text": "I (31M) and my wife (31F) have been married for 8 years and together for 11. We have 2 beautiful children who are my whole world. I love them and my wife immensely. That being said, our marriage hasn\u2019t always been great and as of late (the last 2 years) it seems we aren\u2019t close anymore. I try to engage with her, I have multiple times expressed how I feel (sad, angry, alone) and she recognizes or acknowledges what I say, but never makes any changes to how she is. I can\u2019t fathom a world where I don\u2019t see my kids everyday, so much so that I took a decent sized pay cut last year so I could see them more as I was missing far too much time with them. I feel like I am at a point where I\u2019m almost ready to call it quits and file for divorce, but I can\u2019t imagine my everyday life not involving my children. I know that they would live with their mom, so I would never fight for custody. But I feel so lost. She won\u2019t help me fix this when I have expressed time and time again I would like to work on us both individually and as a couple. \n\nTL;DR I feel alone in this life, but how can I overcome it so that I don\u2019t lose seeing my kids.

With that said, ever since we met she has been a very \u201ctired\u201d person. Loves to nap, loves to sleep. And I\u2019m all for it if there\u2019s nothing going on or the kids didn\u2019t sleep well and we were up all night. But with having expressed that I feel lonely and like we never spend quality time together, I would hope she would sometimes choose to spend some time with me apart from the kids? I am happy to plan date nights and everything, but I don\u2019t think I should have to always go out and spend money just to spend time with my wife. The second the kids are down for the night, whether it\u2019s 7:30pm or 11pm, she\u2019s done for the day and goes straight to bed. She also spends a lot of time on her phone while we are all together, and it\u2019s mostly mindless scrolling through social media or browsing Amazon, which is fine, but I\u2019d rather it not be while the kids are awake or watching her so intently. I just often feel like I am her 3rd or 4th choice in life. Kids first, then herself, then sometimes me/sometimes her parents. I try to talk to her about our expenses, she has a spending problem, and when I do it turns into her becoming upset and saying \u201coh it\u2019s all my fault isn\u2019t it?\u201d Which no, it\u2019s both of ours that we have the debt that we do, but while I try to save she likes to spend so we do struggle to get ahead. Again, I love her to death and I really don\u2019t want to leave but I\u2019m finding myself more and more in pain with each passing day. I don\u2019t sleep much anymore, I find myself constantly stressed and searching for answers. I\u2019m hoping to find a good therapist soon for myself, cause deep down I know I need it. I\u2019m just hurting because I feel like I\u2019m fighting for our future alone",

Hopefully she\u2019s checked her thyroid/vitamins and blood count. \nYou might have to get creative and catch her during her most alert hours. \nIt makes sense that she\u2019s exhausted after caring for children all day. This is me assuming she\u2019s doing slot of the care taking which most women do. It\u2019s exhausting and by the end of the day most just want to crash. \nSo get creative. Not sure how old your kids are but get a nanny/baby sitter/family member and send them away for a morning. Plan something nice at home in the morning/afternoon. \nRegarding the phones. This is a common issue in most relationships. As a society we are all addicted to our devices. Some people play video games, some doom scroll. It\u2019s an epidemic! We\u2019ve lost the art of conversation. Again you\u2019ll have to get creative. I suggest carving out a no device  time in your house. No phones no video games. Buy some cheap conversation builder cards. Get to know each other some more. \nRegarding the finances\u2026that requires professional help or splitting your finances.",

Sometimes, just giving them the space to vent and share their stories can be a huge relief. And they have *plenty* of stories.\n\nI would try to surprise them with small, thoughtful gestures, whether it\u2019s a spontaneous gift, a little treat, or even just a heartfelt note. These small acts of kindness can go a long way in reminding them they\u2019re appreciated.\n\nBut above all, what I\u2019ve found to be the most effective way to help teachers recharge is time away. \n\nA weekend escape or a short holiday where they can fully unplug and unwind makes a world of difference. I once read that teachers make over 100 decisions a day. No wonder they\u2019re mentally exhausted by week\u2019s end. That\u2019s why investing in time away, whether it\u2019s a cozy cabin, a beach getaway, international getaway, or a resort has an incredibly high return (ROI) for their well-being. \n\nThese are all things that *you* should plan and organize BTW.",

You want a marriage that is priority over the kids that when you come home you get hugged and unless its an emergancy your wife asks you how was your day and how you are feeling, having you two sit down together once a week and checking in with each other on how the marriage is going and how they are feeling physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.  How you want to model for your kids what a healthy relationship is like because you want them to have healthy relationship with others when they get older.  Bascially after your second kid you have a new marriage just like after your first kid you had a new marriage... and you will have to do this again once the kids get older and are teens, you two will sit down and talk about this new marriage and how you two are going to work together and apart to be healthy.\n\nI honestly feel like there is deeper issues going on here, she is validating what you are saying but she doesn't care so I feel like there is either mental health issues at play or resentment towards you about something so I honest feel you you need marriage counseling because there is a fight coming that is going to hurt you and is going to hurt her and you two need a ref there to help keep its safe and fair before police and judges get involved.  So yeah start looking into marriage counseling and set one up and not just wait for her because clearly she doesn't want to follow up.  \n\nWhat kind of support system does your wife have?  What kind of support system does your kids have outside of parents and school?  How many dates a month do you two go on?  How much acts of intimacy are you two having daily?  Are you keeping secrets from your wife?  What kind of friends do you have and are you active with your friends and hobbies?  Does your wife have hobbies and friends and how active is she with them?  \n\nCommunication has broken down, WHY?",

Her mom keeps our youngest so she doesn\u2019t have to attend daycare and that is such a blessing because she is great with our kids, like has helped them advance and learn so much. \nWe are potentially moving out next month and back to where we moved from last year (our house never sold) so we have a place to go, but my mother in law can\u2019t keep the kids so my wife is worried about daycare and that is an added layer of stress for sure that I get and don\u2019t fault her for.\nWe go on maybe 1 date a month if we have time/$$. We aren\u2019t swimming in extra money as we have a lot of debt from when we were younger/dumber that we want to pay off. By the time all the bills are paid and we feed our kids there\u2019s very very little to call extra enough to go out to eat. Intimacy is gone really. Living with in-laws, though in a big house, make it\u2019s very difficult but it wasn\u2019t great before we moved in either. When it happens, it\u2019s fantastic and we both throughly enjoy it. \nMy hobbies are golfing and watching movies, though I might play golf once a month and currently live no where near a movie theater so maybe go see a movie once every couple of months. As far as I know, she really likes my friends. They are a good supportive group of guys but most of them live more than 3 hours away as we have all moved for jobs and such.\nI don\u2019t want this to get to a point where lawyers or police are involved, I would never subject my kids to that as I am a product of divorce. \nThank you and please let me know what other questions I can answer",

Take a kid sometime as well so they can learn from you what makes you happy and learn new things.  As for the movies SHAME on you, you don't have to go to the movie theaters to see movies thanks to DVDs and online piracy you can get most movies free at home and you can make the house into a movie theater, so pop some popcorn, hit up the dollar tree for some candies, and take movie night home.  Yes there will be adult movie night only but this would be a fun date night you can do with your wife.  Yeah so what she falls asleep, just make sure she is cuddled up with you and that moment of intimacy is still there.  \n\nWhat about her friends?  What about her hobbies?  Do you know what they are?

We both would die for our kids but fighting for a good marriage seems to be beyond her. \n\nI feel your pain.",

        "text": "I (30F) have been married to Ben (32M) for 8 years, and we have three children together. Recently, I did something I know you\u2019re not supposed to do\u2014I went through my husband\u2019s phone.\n\nWhat I found really hurt me. There were messages between him and a woman\u2014let\u2019s call her T. I\u2019ve explicitly asked him not to speak with her before, because she has always made me extremely uncomfortable. She\u2019s the kind of person who craves attention, regardless of who gets hurt in the process, and I\u2019ve never seen her as a good influence. Despite my concerns, they\u2019ve continued talking. In fact, the messages showed that they\u2019ve had to block and unblock each other multiple times, which tells me they know it\u2019s not appropriate.\n\nWhat hurt most, though, were the things he said about me to her. He spoke about me with such bitterness and disrespect\u2014called me awful names for years. And T knows full well that I didn\u2019t want them speaking. What he never mentioned to her, though, is how lonely I felt during the times he now criticizes me for being a \u201cb.\u201d He wasn\u2019t there emotionally. He didn\u2019t support me through the birth of our first child. He wasn\u2019t present in the ways a partner should be.\n\nI also found messages between him and his biological cousin. Their dynamic has always struck me\u2014and even my sister-in-law\u2014as odd. But I brushed it off because, well, she\u2019s family, right? Wrong.\n\nThe messages date all the way back to when my husband and I first started dating. They\u2019ve been calling each other things like \u201cbaby,\u201d \u201chunny,\u201d \u201csweetie,\u201d \u201cdear,\u201d and \u201cbabe.\u201d My husband doesn\u2019t even call me those names. On top of that, she sends him pictures\u2014essentially lingerie shots with just a sliver of her face showing\u2014and he sends her shirtless photos that include the top of his waist. The kind of pictures you\u2019d never think someone would send their cousin.\n\nI\u2019m honestly devastated and confused. I don\u2019t know what to do. Is this harmless? Am I overreacting? I feel so deeply hurt and betrayed\n\nTL;DR\n\nMarried 8 years with 3 kids, I went through my husband\u2019s phone and found hurtful messages between him and a woman I\u2019d asked him not to talk to. He spoke badly about me and hid how emotionally absent he\u2019s been. I also found inappropriate messages and photos exchanged with his biological cousin. I feel deeply betrayed and don\u2019t know what to do next.\n\n\nUPDATE: \nThank you all for your advice and for validating that I\u2019m not overreacting. I do have more context and details I can share. I didn\u2019t go into too many specifics in my original post because I didn\u2019t expect it to gain much attention. I also apologize for this being a long update. I just need to vent. \n\nI found the messages between my husband and T in July 2024. He had confided in her about deeply personal things, like his dad\u2019s passing and other intimate matters. During those times, I reached out to him so many times, trying to support him. But he always pushed me away and showed no emotion. I just chalked it up to \u201cthat\u2019s how he is,\u201d but it hurt\u2014because I\u2019m his wife, and that\u2019s supposed to be my role, right? I honestly don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done to make him feel like he can\u2019t come to me. When I confronted him, he told me I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong\u2026 but there has to be a reason, right?\n\nAt that time, the messages I had seen between him and his cousin\u2014we\u2019ll call her A\u2014weren\u2019t exactly alarming, but they felt \u201coff\u201d to me. Just\u2026 weird. While we were working on our marriage, I asked him if he could go low contact with A, especially after everything with T. I didn\u2019t think it was too much to ask\u2014a basic sign of respect. But he pushed back hard and refused. So eventually, I gave up and said whatever.\n\nFast forward to February 2025: I had this nagging feeling again and decided to check his phone to see if he was back in contact with T. (I know I shouldn\u2019t have gone through his phone\u2014it\u2019s wrong\u2014but I had trust issues, and I gave in.) While I didn\u2019t find anything new with T, I did find more questionable messages between him and A.\n\nI told him I couldn\u2019t continue working on our relationship if he kept making me feel disrespected and unheard. I gave him a clear boundary: he needed to go no contact with A for a while, or I was leaving. He reluctantly agreed and blocked her.\n\nWELL\u2026 later that evening, I had a gut feeling again and decided to double-check if he\u2019d actually kept her blocked. I searched her name on Snapchat, and what I found shocked me: she had another account\u2014one that went all the way back to 2014. And that\u2019s where the inappropriate messages were.\n\nThere were messages like him sending her a picture of our gender reveal, followed by, \u201cI miss you so much, sweetie.\u201d Or after the birth of our son, he sent her a shirtless photo of himself in the hospital with the message, \u201cHey babe. Continues by flirting\u201d This is minutes after I had an unmedicated, traumatic birth. \n\nWe got into a heated argument, and of course, he said all the right things to calm me down and get me to work on forgiving him.\n\nLater, I texted A and sent her screenshots of their conversations, asking if she thought this was okay. She apologized and said she \u201cblurred the lines\u201d (WEIRD). I responded, but she never replied after that. So, me being me, I downloaded a texting app and messaged her pretending to be my husband. She basically said she didn\u2019t think it was wrong because \u201cwe (my husband and I) weren\u2019t that serious\u201d (???)\u2014and that when she showed her mom the messages, her mom didn\u2019t see anything wrong either.\n\nI just keep asking myself: What kind of family did I marry into? Everyone I\u2019ve shown the screenshots to is shocked. No one believes this is how two cousins talked.",

It really has stuck with me over the years too. I cant believe that some people find that to be okay! Its ur blood for christ sake!!

        "text": " My wife (32f) and I (35m) have been married since 2011. Things were hard when we got married. She was 18, I was 21. \n   Her mom used her as a slave basically. She did all the cooking and cleaning apart from what her aunt and uncle helped with. They were mentally deficient, but were functional as far as basic needs. They could cook basic meals, they knew the cleaning routine, had hobbies, and basic hygiene care. They were awesome people, and they were so mistreated. (Yes, over the years it has been reported by many of us, but my MIL was a foster parent and knows all of the people in the system). \n    My wife and I moved 800 miles away after we tried to make a life where we grew up. It's (where we grew up)  a small town and it seemed like every job I found that seemed like the answer to our problems was just given to the boss's buddy's kid or something. \n   Anyway, we moved. Stayed with a relative for a while. Found a good job, but it required a lot of overtime,  which I needed because we found out we were pregnant with our first of 5 right before we moved. I worked a few other jobs before it. But it payed more and I got more hours. I gave up a day shift job that let me be creative everyday, off at 3, and weekends off. Just so I could go manually load 100,000 lbs of freight onto trucks manually for 16 hours a day, 6 days a week.\n   My wife blew all the \"extra\" money going shopping for baby stuff, but it was our first kid and we were excited. I am a very practical person, so I thought it was excessive, and I said so. But my concerns were overlooked. We did end up buying a house after a while. But that was because some freinds we had met at a local church did a rent to own contract for their old house when they bought a new one. \n   We ruined that relationship.  Our payments were always late. The house was always a mess. Like bad. But I was never there because I had to work so much. \n   My wife met a freind in like 2013. The friend was in a marriage she wanted out of but wouldn't leave on her own. She took advantage of the fact that my wife had never been allowed to have friends growing up and that I was always working. It ended up that they had an affair. \n   I had to have a back surgery in 2016 because of an injury I got at work. 2 days after I came home to recover, she brought me a German Shepherd puppy and then left to go stay with her girlfriend.  \n   I understand my wife's past. Her childhood was messed up. Because of that, I forgave her. Mostly because The state I was in favored the mother in custody cases, and unfortunately it was also a state that didn't care (legally) if your partner cheats. I could not risk her getting custody of my kids, because her girlfriend was not a good person and my wife's mother would inevitably end up with them, and I won't let that happen.\n   So, I stayed. We moved back to the area we grew up in about 5 years ago. We had to stay with my MIL because we spent our savings (sold our old house wasnt much $)because my wife had an emergency where she almost died. \nShe also doesn't listen to anything I say. She doesn't respect my boundaries. She babysits kids in our home. I asked her when she started babysitting to make sure that she didn't leave extra kids with me without talking to the parents ahead of time. This is just because I personally know 2 people whose lives were ruined because of false accusations. Also, I would not be comfortable if it was my kids in that situation. And I want to extend that respect to the parents. My wife has not respected this boundary at all, and gets mad when I get upset. She will wait until our baby falls asleep on me and then she suddenly has to meet someone for a purchase she made on marketplace (that I had no knowledge about, but she swears she told me)or some other false emergency.\n   Lately her mental health has been in rough shape. She admitted herself to a psych ward a couple months ago. Just said she wasn't feeling well and went to the ER while I watched the kids. Didn't hear from her for hours and then she was gone for a week. I have tried to be supportive. I try to praise her for using the information she was given. We have had a lot of talks about different issues. The problem is that when she figures out something she had been doing has been negative in some way, she gets mad at me. Like I am saying it to her. I purposely don't say much during these talks and just play therapist. You know, \" How does that make you feel? Why do you think you feel that way? How do you think you could take action to make the situation better?\" \n   So I don't understand why she blames it on me. I have tried to protect her emotionally and show her how things should be because I had a good parent that taught me about emotional intelligence. I don't know it all, but I try to share what I do kniw with her and my kids.\nLast night, she asked me if I wanted to make our relationship work . I said that I did. She asked if I was willing to give 100%. I said that I was. \nShe then tells me that I don't want to be with her and that I have fallen out of love with her. \n   I told her that I love her and that I always will. She got mad, said that my actions tell her everything she needs to know and got up and told me I could have the house, the kids everything. She said she was done.  And then she left. Turned off her location and was gone an hour. Came back and wanted to argue some more. \n    I'm so tired. I really do love her. I want to be the old people that the young people come to for advice. But I don't see that happening.  She frequently accuses me of treating her like a child. She is terrible with money, and anytime I mention that we can't afford to spend on xyz, I'm treating her like a child. She refuses to make her own decisions under the guise of \" I shouldn't have to tell you what I like after 16 years\".  Basically, if it is difficult or uncomfortable,  I am stuck with it.  \n   She downloaded life360 on my phone while I was asleep about a year ago too. I left it because I didn't want to fight and I don't have anything to hide. But, she turns her wifi off so that it isn't as accurate and doesn't let me know anything when she goes out. If I call to check in, she can't go anywhere without me calling too much. \n\nAfter last night, I feel numb. I just don't care anymore. I feel like I'm being cold hearted. I don't want to feel this way. But I can't keep living this way. I don't want my kids to live in divorced home. But that is what's going to happen. I'm really struggling with this. There is soon much more I could add. I don't kniw what else to do because I know when I tell her I'm done se will threaten sewer slide or to admit herself again.  Any advice appreciated \n\n\n\nTL;DR\":    wife left last night said a he was done with our marriage that has been strained for years. I am numb and done now too. Help\nPlease\n\n",

        "text": "i'll try to keep it short, but i (late 20s f) wanted to cast a net and see if i can get any answers. i am considering leaving my marriage of just over a year (we've been together for 4 total) for a list of reasons, one big one being our dead sex life ( see my post history for more details ). i just have not felt desired or seen or heard by my husband (early 30s m) in almost the entirety of our marriage and am starting to realize we're not as compatible long term as i had hoped. i've tried having multiple, very vulnerable talks with with him, but he has been unresponsive to almost everything, and when he does respond, it's just annoyance or anger. he refuses to acknowledge the role he is playing in making me unhappy, and i can't keep begging him to care for the rest of my life. i even asked him for marriage therapy at one point, and he responded by getting angry and calling me inconsiderate. i am starting individual therapy soon to pull me out of the hole my marriage has thrown me down.\n\nwe have no children, no shared bank accounts, and both have a separate car in our names. i've been peeking around at apartments i can afford on my own, and found a few good looking spots. but there's so much that scares me. the societal judgement around divorce in general, but especially a young divorce. the dating world in the modern day is an absolute nightmare. the moving out and trying to get my things out of our apartment ( we did not sign a preen up). my family adores my husband, my siblings call him their brother, we share a friend group and have built a life together. for all my pain and anger and sadness, i do still love this man. we've shared so much. but i can't keep living like this, being with someone who expects monogamy, forces complete celibacy, and demands silence; demands i never, ever talk about how this is all making me feel.  looking back, yes, there were warning signs, but as they say, love *really is* fucking blind. i guess i am both venting and looking for advice/support/anything, really.\n\nTL;DR - for those who left a childless marriage, what was that process like? what do you wish you'd known then that you know now? do you have any regrets?",

I came home one day and ended it. \n\nDating: I had plenty of success on Tinder. I am probably a 7/10 at my best, 6'0\" on the dot. Was going out 3ish times a week. Dating pool is not as bleak as people make it seem.\n\nLeaving: Just do it and get it over with. Life is too short to be miserable and not be having sex.\n\nWhat to expect: more than likely, you will both walk away with your assets under your own name. If you have any assets that were purchasing during marriage, it'll likely go 50/50 even if one person footed the entire thing. More than likely, the goal is to figure out who gets what, and put it in writing with a lawyer, otherwise everything you can't agree on who gets will be sold, 50% going to each party.\n\n-----------\n\nI wish I knew how much happier I would be 6 years earlier. Leaving was the best decision I ever made. My life improved about 20x. I would recommend adopting the fact you will get push back from people who you need support from, and you are **far better** distancing yourself from them if they do. They will be working to make you feel worse, then you'll be second guessing your decision.\n\nYou're making the right choice. Don't let your support system try to villainize you.",

        "text": "I am 35f married for 15 years. Our marriage has been on the verge for so long and last year my husband thought it was a good idea to have someone else be involved so I can explore what it felt like to be with someone else I've only had sex with him. He found someone who was willing to sleep with me but we ended up getting to know each other in a deeper level and met up a few times it came down to the point where I ended things because feelings were starting to evolve and I knew I was going to be the one getting hurt. It's been months that I haven't seen this person but I think about him all the time and at times I'm hurt because he was want I needed but couldn't have. My husband still pushes to sleep with someone and I feel like I'll never be enough for him he has the fantasy of someone else sleeping with me. I know I was dumb for letting this other person in but I have the biggest heart anyone can ask for my husband doesn't see what he has at home and this person made me feel something I haven't felt in so long. I feel like the day he brought him in my marriage was over I've stuck around because we have kids. I am so lost and just need someone to talk to at times \n\n\nTl;DR fulfilling husbands fantsies back fired on me ",

You did exactly what you are supposed to do in cutting things off. But I do think there\u2019s a lot to unravel here and a therapist would be the person that can help you process this. \ud83d\udda4",

That\u2019s when it hit me, your doing great from what I\u2019m reading and sometimes putting you foot down and letting him know enough is enough pushes those fantasies out\u2026. Many different ways for you to engage that are exciting without involving other people\u2026. You just have to know you are enough and there is nothing wrong\u2026.

She ends up connecting with someone else, realizing how caring and loving they can be to her, which actually then makes the husband jealous. She then feels guilty, despite enjoying the experience her husband encouraged. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about you or your desires; it\u2019s about *him* and *his* needs, at *your* expense. A person who truly loves his wife and the mother of his children would never put her in this position. A narcissist doesn\u2019t care.\n\nIf you take anything from this, please remember that this situation and predicament says more about your present *relationship* than it does about *you*. Someone suggesting opening the marriage often signals the end of the relationship. Call me old fashioned but I would *never* share my partner to satisfy some kink.\n\nYou\u2019re right to feel the way you do. You\u2019ve discovered what it feels for someone else to value *you* and have *you* feel special to them. While I wouldn\u2019t advise pursuing this guy in particular, it shows you\u2019re craving something more real.\n\nThis can happen when people marry young and don\u2019t fully know themselves, their partner, or what they want or need. Staying in this relationship will likely only breed resentment and that connection with someone else can\u2019t be undone. \n\nPS Couples therapy doesn\u2019t work if your partner is a narcissist; they actually use this against you. I would pursue individual therapy or just get your ducks in a row and rip the bandaid off now.",

If I were you, I would focus on something empowering, something that made you feel like the other guy made you feel. Maybe get in touch with the other guy again? Feelings are real and do complicate things, but maybe those feelings are what you need to help you realize that you are a strong woman capable of taking the trash out!\n\nI realized I didn't bluntly answer your question.

She was kicked out by her ex\u2019s family and they divorced. She waited 5 years hoping he\u2019d return, but he remarried and had a daughter. She stayed single for another 5 years until we met.\n\nAt her parents\u2019 house, there's a basement where they hang family pictures \u2014 including a framed photo from her wedding with her ex. I asked her if it could be taken down because it makes me really uncomfortable, especially since that\u2019s the space where all guests gather. She told me she doesn\u2019t have a say in her mother\u2019s house, and the photo also includes her late grandfather, so her mother refuses to take it down.\n\nI\u2019ve let it go for a year, but during her sister\u2019s wedding (hosted in the same basement), her ex-marriage became a topic of discussion when the photo was noticed. It reopened everything for me emotionally. I told my wife if this is acceptable, I\u2019ll hang a photo from my previous marriage in our own home. I know it was a petty move \u2014 I just wanted her to feel what I\u2019ve been feeling.\n\nWe\u2019re now arguing over this. She says she has no control over her mother and doesn't want to cause conflict. I feel like she just won\u2019t take a stand for something that affects me deeply. Besides this issue, we have a good relationship, but this photo \u2014 and what it represents \u2014 keeps hurting me.\n\nAm I being unreasonable? Should I let it go? Or should I expect more effort from her in addressing something that hurts her current husband?\n\nTL;DR:\nMy wife\u2019s family has a photo of her and her ex-husband on their wall. It makes me uncomfortable, especially since guests regularly see it and ask about it. She says it\u2019s her mom\u2019s decision and won\u2019t push it. I tried to make a point by saying I\u2019ll hang my own ex-marriage photo at our place. Now we\u2019re fighting. Am I wrong to be this upset?",

Maybe she forgot she has it up and its just been there for years, maybe she likes the picture because she thinks her daughter looks beautiful in it, maybe she likes the ex more than she likes you.  Who knows.  But you have no right to decide what another person has hanging on the wall in their house.  And to start a fight with your wife over it isn't a great look my guy.  You can feel any way you want, you can even refuse to go over there if you want.  But you don't get to tell someone what they can do in their own home.",

Her boyfriend lives with her. And she didn\u2019t like her mother in laws but still invites her and we all have a good time during those moments. \n\nMy other son in law 20 and more years I still call both of them that, invited me and my daughter to Christmas at the house.

Have you guys offered a picture of the two of you to replace it? \n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear the topic came back up and her mother is the one keeping it up. I\u2019m guessing that you have some insecurity related to how long she dated the ex, how HE left HER and maybe you have feelings about that? Funny enough I can sympathize somewhat in that my grandmother has pictures of all of her kids up in the basement, along with grandkids and great grandchildren\u2026including wedding pictures of divorced spouses except one (cheater). The correct response next time it comes up that the picture is still up is \u201cyeah I could see why you need the picture with that dude, since how else are you going to remember the guy that bounced? We are married and I don\u2019t need to be up as a picture on that wall, since I\u2019ll be here until my wife puts me 6 feet under!\u201d \n\nI think there\u2019s an insecurity that you need to address with your wife first and then the picture won\u2019t matter. Sit down and talk with you wife and hash it out, as I\u2019m guessing that you might be worried she has lingering feelings for the ex husband or that she doesn\u2019t care enough to fight for you. I\u2019d be a bit insecure if I didn\u2019t know if my wife was fully in my corner or would rather not push back on something related to the ex.\n\nBest of luck but I think you just need to attack this from a different angle. I think your wife does like you more but her mom is being stubborn and had a long history with the ex or really wants the picture of the grandma in there. God help you if your mother in law is an immigrant because (if it\u2019s like my immigrant family) the picture wall in the basement is a THING.

We'd been dating 18 months and living together. His mother was displaying a photo of his ex girlfriend of 7 years. Her graduation photo, with him in it. She was a much loved member of their family, and i think they split because their world views were growing too far apart (feminist VS trotskyist). I asked my boyfriend to have the picture taken down. The mum was quite surprised. It's like she hadn't been considered it. I think the picture was left up. I decided it wasn't that important, and I needs to be confident in myself.\n\nAnother story, half my family are still Facebook friends with my ex who I left 15 years ago. Come on! We didn't even live on the same city, so they met only a handful of times and were hardly close. It was a bit of a slap in the face they didn't delete him.

My feelings are always dismissed or minimized. She says my depression is to blame for pretty much everything. I have been in therapy for 4 years and have grown lots and now I can see my mental health is not the issue and my therapist agrees.

        "post-author": "penny_girl_",
        "text": "So, this is a long story but I'll try to keep it short. I could go on.\n\nMy husband and I have been together for 9 years and married for about 9 months. I'm at the point where I am angry with him or resentful towards him almost all of the time. I feel like he is the classic example of \"if he wanted to, he would.\" \n\n\\-I work long hours as a server and the other week I worked 9 days in a row with 12 hour shifts and he would say things like \"If you want the dishes done tonight you're gonna have to do it because I'm not doing it.\" And generally would procrastinate getting ready for bed when all I wanted was a good night's sleep. But suddenly today he had a long work day and he is ready for bed because HE wants a good night's sleep. But if I have something going on it's always a fight for him to come to bed (I'm a light sleeper so he'd wake me up otherwise)\n\n\\-it seems to always be a \"tit for tat\" thing when I tell him that in order to be intimate, I need emotional connection/quality time/etc. And his response is always \"well in order to want to spend time with you, I need physical intimacy\" (not sure what words I'm allowed to say on here lol. I feel like we're at a crossroads and we just keep digging our heels in.\n\n\\-He always does that thing where I'm looking at him and asking him a question and he won't answer, making me repeat myself. Then he'll say \"I said YES.\" although I was watching him the whole time and he definitely did not even nod his head. (that's always his excuse)\n\n\\-generally I'm just annoyed at almost everything he does. I don't like sleeping in the same bed as him, I never want to be intimate with him, and I hate that he drinks everyday. He didn't have a job all winter and was supposed to get all these home projects done and didn't finish a single one. His excuse was that he was \"healing from burnout.\" Meanwhile I'm working 3 part time jobs and am extremely burnt out. I am just really annoyed and done and need a break from him.\n\n\\-I started seeing a therapist weekly and I'm working a lot on myself and have been for about a year now. He has many issues with substance abuse and dopamine addiction and parental issues that he keeps saying he will work out and that he needs to talk to someone but at the end of the day I feel like he's too lazy to take steps to do any of that. Again, if he wanted to, the would. (He always makes time to golf.)\n\n\\-I have anxiety and he says things like \"I dont get why you're so stressed out\" or \"just stop\" like every single day. I feel like he has no patience for me which makes me so angry.\n\n\\-At this point, most of our interactions end in some sort of argument. Sometimes as an experiment, I treat him the way that he treats me (not answering right away, giving one word answers, not helping out with cleaning) and he notices RIGHT away. And I always say \"well this is how you treat me, I'm just playing the game too.\" I am just so unhappy with our relationship at the moment. which sucks, we just got married. (but again, been together almost a decade.)\n\n\n\nTL;DR I've been with my husband a long time and I find that I'm angry at him most of the time, what can I do?  ",

Your spouse is one of the most important people in your life, and ideally the relationship with them would be more harmonious than it is not.\n\nYou need to ask yourself: why do you feel resentment.  That is a pretty strong emotion and it's hard for love to truly blossom when resentment has set in.  To me, I look at resentment setting in like an infection, and it permeates the entire subtext of the relationship.\n\nYou may need to humble yourself and surrender to the relationship.  Be vulnerable, and by that I mean open up your tender side to him your tender needs and wants and desires and fears and dreams of what could be.  If he says or does something hurtful, interrupt him and get him to focus on you in that very moment, and let him know how much it hurts and that you really need from him is connection, and \\_\\_\\_ \\[insert whatever you else need here\\].  You need to let your heart warm up to him otherwise the cold and resentful subtext will be behind the actions you take or the words you speak and continue to corrode the interactions between the two of you.\n\nObviously with all that said, he needs to do HIS part as well, as the success of your relationship is not only your responsibility.  But the fact that you are crying out for help tells me that you care, that you want better for the two of you and that is commendable.  You cannot force him to take action, he may not even be equipped to fully understand the depth of your needs and your emotions and how his behavior makes you feel and how those feelings in return translate into how you interact with him.  His actions (or lack thereof) directly affect your feelings.  He needs to put himself in YOUR shoes and see how tiring a 12 hour shift is,and the least he can do to help you manage your responsibilities is to do the dishes. Or surprise you from time to time.  You need that.  He needs to attend to your needs, otherwise what is the point of continuing the relationship, if your needs are not being met? \n\nYou might need to tell his mom or someone close to him and hopefully they can get him to shape up and put himself in your shoes.  That's the underpinning of empathy, which is apparently lacking from you've told us.",

It talks about how a women needs love (connection and time.) a man needs respect (plus sex). Talks about how both people will go in a constant circle of all that you mentioned. I believe it\u2019s by a religious writer. Just want to throw that out there. But how ever you feel about God should give you a lot of insight to that crossroads. \n\nI think seeing a therapist is good for you. I think both of you should go into marriage counseling. It will hopefully help him see the issues you mentioned and hopefully start working on himself. Also want to say don\u2019t go to the counseling with the goal of fixing him. No matter how much better you may be doing in areas does not mean there are areas you are making mistakes. \n\nI see there are a lot of underlying issues going on with him. Which is making things harder. Almost sounds like he could be dealing with depression or other issues. ( only going off of what you said) guys don\u2019t like to have to admit or face the fact that they are. He most likely already sees all the issues he mentioned but is having a hard time just over coming what he has going on in his head. \n\n\nLast thing I will mention. Just as much as you need that connection to want to be intimate with him. Just how deep of a need that connection is a need for you is just as big of a need for him with intimacy. You are both looking at each other and saying until you meet my need I do not want to attempt to meet yours. When we marry someone it should not be self seeking to just get your needs met. You should be seeking to meet the needs of your spouse and your spouse vice versa. This is where a lot of marriages start to fail. Because of hurt and other issues we forget that we should be seeking to met our spouses needs and love them in the good and the bad.",

        "text": "My wife (29F) and I (30M) have been married for the past five years. We both have good jobs and own a very nice home, so from the outside everything looks perfect. About three years ago my wife started gaining weight and it definitely started negatively affecting her self-esteem. Still, everything in our marriage was going well. About six months ago she began mentioning this guy from work, let\u2019s call him Ryan. Stuff like \u201cOh my friend Ryan from work suggested we watch \u2018The White Lotus\u2019 or \u2018Ryan from work is also a big Pacers fan\u2019 etc. My wife is in event planning sales and Ryan (40M) is a cater-waiter for the company. Not to sound like a jerk, but since he was 40 years old and still just waiter I thought I had nothing to worry about. I should also mention that my wife, despite the weight gain has an incredibly gorgeous face, good style, is super intelligent and charming\u2026\u2026..so she still has no problem getting male attention. So my wife keeps bringing up Ryan more and more and I\u2019ve noticed them texting at least daily, about stuff not directly related to work. Fast forward to last Thursday, my wife invited to get drinks with some of her work friends. Surprise, surprise Ryan was there. He\u2019s like four inches taller than  me and probably more conventionally handsome than me, so that\u2019s not great. My wife and him were flirting and making eyes at each other the entire night. She even mentioned what a sexy deep voice he had. I was also hoping he way gay, but he\u2019s definitely straight. I don\u2019t know if my wife has cheated yet, but it definitely seems like she\u2019s about to. Should I ask her if she\u2019s attracted to Ryan? Does she just like that a good-looking guy is giving her attention? No chance she would leave me for him, right?

What this other guy has that you don't, besides being a few inches taller and somewhat conventionally more attractive, is new things to learn about him and learn/be exposed to via a relationship with him. Well he has that and self confidence, and likely better people skills, which unlike your height are both things you can work to improve.\n\nBesides learning from this guy what is missing in your relationship you are going to need to set a boundary, but do so in a way that doesn't come off as insecure. At the very least let her know that you noticed that the two of them are a bit too friendly",

It turns out she had cheated on me before and during the marriage. We did successfully reconcile and are happily married today. We are both completely transparent. We both have an open device policy. She doesn\u2019t hide anything. If something happens that might cause me concern, she\u2019s up front about it. I wish I didn\u2019t have to go through all that.

Stay calm, confident, and collected. Don\u2019t accuse, don\u2019t beg, don\u2019t get emotional, and definitely don\u2019t overcompensate with affection or anger.

Ask has she been physically intimate with this guy that she\u2019s clearly infatuated with, and so forth. Then ask the key question, does she still want to be in this marriage? Make it clear, she\u2019s free to choose or do, but you\u2019re not going to wait around while she\u2019s emotionally or physically involved with someone else. You deserve honesty and respect.\n\nBe prepared though, she may minimize, deny, or gaslight. Stay grounded. If she gets defensive or tries to flip it on you, that tells you even more.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s time to shift your own behavior. Not with revenge, but with self-respect. Show that actions have consequences, not to punish her, but to honor your own worth.

She is crossing all sorts of boundaries and you need to tell her if she wants to stay married then he needs to go.\n\nIt's not an ultimatum when you tell her exactly what will happen with her choices. She wants to stay flirty and have him in her life, then you bounce. She wants her marriage then she cuts him off.....pretty easy solution.\n\nIf she gets defensive and calls you the typical \"jealous, controlling, or insecure\" tell her that's fine but it's not changing anything. You know what it will take to keep our marriage and what isn't acceptable. Start planning your exist strategy now",

She has been texting a married man 2-4 times per week for the last decade. Why? He's married to a mutual friend, and they both play Words With Friends. I tease her that he's her WWF husband. We've actually only met him once, so I know they couldn't physically cheat, but they're not emotionally cheating either. I think he appreciates their friendship since his marriage seems crap, but he hasn't crossed any red lines. \n\nI told you all this not because I think we have similar situations, because we definitely don't. Instead, I wanted to show you what a marriage built on trust looks like. If you're adjunct internet strangers, you either already know, or you're still emotionally immature. I think you already know the answer. \n\n\"Honey, you've been focusing on Ryan more and more, and it's crossing some marital boundaries. You and Ryan were openly flirting with each other, and I wasn't the only one who noticed. Tell me why you're emotionally cheating or admit if you're physically cheating. Then, decide if you want to save our marriage by attending counseling, among other things.\" \n\nThis all hinges on whether or not YOU want to save your marriage. Think about that before you talk to her. \n\nBy the way, his failure as a man means nothing to a woman.

Everybody knew him. I just don\u2019t know if something\u2019s been going on for 20 years or if it just started two years ago when she lost 80 pounds.   Everybody loves my wife and she does have a pretty face too. I thought it was just like an emotional thing but she lost a lot of weight still on birth control. I just wanted to have more sex. She told me she\u2019s not horny and she\u2019s on birth control for her period thing then a day or two later I picked up her phone Boy did she freak out. And I went and checked a lot of people. She\u2019s text messaging to see how far back they go years. I save the best for last one day. Her messages went back with him. The first message was her telling him she\u2019s not coming into work because of our little fight about the sex For days she claims she\u2019s never ever texted him five days later she said he sent her a text saying she\u2019s pretty lost weight and they decided to stop texting.  That\u2019s all she needs to this day is deleting the text.  I found out she was consistently calling him every time she left the house. She was supposed to be taking tennis lessons disappearing for hours for a half hour lesson, but I kept looking and then swingers clubs came up and random phone numbers just calling her once there was a pattern between like 10 and 12 in the morning. I was just looking for patterns check the numbers one of them was a very attractive woman with three kids she told me thecalls  were from Uber drivers.   \nI think she had sex with half of my town in half of his town using these special apps   25 year anniversary this is right before we\u2019re getting a divorce. She is a narcissist. I realized evil no regrets no remorse. No apologies for what she\u2019s done. We even have a seven-year-old son. She said kids are resilient.  Then she told me that I\u2019m the one who said that.  Then it changed that my one friend I have told that to me and I told her.   \n\nHas become a disaster I just had a weird feeling for some reason the way she looked at me and her phone one day when it was on the table I picked it up. That\u2019s how they started. She started crying saying she wants to leave. I\u2019m scaring her I knew something was going on.\n\nFirst thing do not let her know you\u2019re on her do some research. Try to check her phone check bank records follow her if you have to. That was my mistake never in 1 million years that I think she would\u2019ve done what she did I did not handle it right \n\nGo with your gut do some research. Ask her just to see her phone. See how she responds.   Oh, and by the way, her father left her family to go start another one after he had an affair.  She was my high school sweethearts since we were 17 I was supposed to be the only one she\u2019s been with.  Not anymore do I think that I just don\u2019t know how long it was going on for and she won\u2019t tell me anything yesterday I discovered I think she had an abortion calling gynecologist doctor and calling this place in Washington ACOG.  All of these doctors appointment.\nShe always took care of everything. I never had a reason to doubt her. I was a fool. Go with your gut do some research. Watch some videos on how to try to catch somebody what to look for.  I wish you luck and I hope you do not end up like me. Hopefully, this is all in your head.  PS nobody believe me I stopped contact with my family obviously her family, which I think her family knows everything. My house is going on the market in a couple days. She\u2019s going to get my son. I have no idea what I\u2019m doing or where I\u2019m going.",

If she has a code or such and not before then you know she is hiding things. If nothing is off there to be able to look, then look and do so deep. Check trash folders, socials, archives, apps, etc. People use snapchat and WhatsApp to cheat a lot for they are secured and message can be deleted without having to do so yourself. If she has them, they could be a sign. And if you can open them, you can see what you find...\n\nBut as I said, I would investigate ASAP on her phone and such first. If I find anything, screen shot and forward all proof to myself. Save them to my phone to avoid them being deleted later in how you send them too...\n\nIf nothing is found, confront with my issues and refuse gaslighting. If proof is found, a hardcore confrontation can be made. Cheaters when caught will be like a deer in headlights trying to process things.

If she refuses then she is hiding something. \n\nMay want to get voice recorders in the house and in her car to see if they talk when you\u2019re not around. \n\nBut I would sit her down and tell her how you feel. Tell her you think she is heading into dangerous territory.  You think there is an emotional affair getting started and you would like her to back off communicating with him outside of work hours. \n\nMake sure she understands that this could damage your marriage because your trust is being strained. \n\nIf she calls you controlling tell her it\u2019s not controlling when you are crossing a boundary. And if she says insecure tell you no You are disrespecting me, and our marriage. You love her but you won\u2019t put up with this. \n\nIf she puts up resistance may need a Private detective. \n\nIf she won\u2019t stop you may have to confront the potential AP to back off.   \n\nYou can even leave home and stay with a friends. \nLeave your wedding band in her pillow with a note saying when you\u2019re ready to be my wife again call me. But that if things get really bad. \n\nKeep us updated on how the conversation went and what your response will be. \n\nUpdateMe!\n\nEDIT:  Here is a link to a video how affairs begin. Watch it. And then send it to her. \n\nAll reditters should watch this and let their SO see it too. Let me know what you think. \n\n[https://www.facebook.com/share/v/19zCAvpqyP/?mibextid=UalRPS](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/19zCAvpqyP/?mibextid=UalRPS)",

Do yourself a pleasure, and just leave her. Find somebody else that is actually interested in you, and loves you.\n\nHave a serious talk with her, this behavior I'd unacceptable.

To do so in front of you AND her other coworkers suggests that it's something they're very, very comfortable with.\n\nYes, she's cheating. At this point, it's probably just an emotional affair, but there's no guarantee they haven't found quick moments in a broom closet somewhere. There are a number of ways to handle this but none will be easy.\n\nThe simplest is to sit her down and ask her to explain her relationship with him. To ask her whether or not she'd be comfortable with you seeing her text exchanges with him? To ask her whether she'd be comfortable with her parents and/or your parents seeing her text exchanges with him? Chances are, you're going to get a lot of \"no\" answers or spurious deleting of messages before being able to look. I would also be sure to ask if she would be comfortable with you exchanging messages with another woman the way she and Ryan exchange messages. If you're lucky, it's a wake up call. If, instead, you're met with accusations of being controlling and suggestions that you can't tell her who she is friends with, I'd recommend calling a lawyer because she's choosing him in that moment.\n\nYes, affairs often start with a partner getting attention from someone else. They like that new attention so they feed into it. And it builds until it turns into an emotional affair. And then it builds some more until it's a physical affair. Your wife is headed down that path. You may be able to pull her back, but understand that it may already be too late.",

                "body": "Let's look for a cause for her behavior first, before figuring out how to address it. She loves you and married you. Wife then gains weight and (knows or suspects) you find her less attractive- as it was literally the first thing you mentioned. (When I got heavy I could see my husband's face and body language and knew without a word) She sees that you would want her to be different than she is right now and questions her attractiveness feels bad about herself. She's worried about what you and others think, even if she doesn't act like it bothers her. Nobody likes being overweight- and if she had a magic wand, she probably wouldn't be. She is faced with the choice of trying to change her eating or exercise habits and it's scary and takes effort (trying to change any habit sucks) or she can feel bad (or judged) about it and try to comfort herself and be validated. She can try prove to herself that she is acceptable just as she is. Since some people don't find heavier women unattractive, this coworker person may sincerely be attracted to your wife's personality. If he is showering her with approval and enjoying being with her then THAT is the crux of the issue. If sex happens, it is not likely that she wants sex outside the marriage. She may just want validation from someone who doesn't remind her that she's \"mostly attractive but still overweight\". She probably wants YOUR approval and because you mentioned weight right off the bat, you may not be able to make her feel attractive because you don't actually find her as attractive anymore. Can you convince her that the weight is not a barrier in you loving her and that even if she never lost weight, you will still feel like a damn lucky guy!? So if you are worried about an affair, then letting her know that you find her attractive and sexy and you are jealous that someone else is spending time with her (when you want to be her favorite man out of all the other men). Let her know you want her to choose you and to protect your relationship and that you would do the same if someone was blurring a line and some girl wanted to hang out and you would not feel comfortable with it. Don't judge- just remind her that you still choose her and want reassurance that she's still choosing you.",

        "text": "So I want to keep this as short as possible while keeping all the details. \n\nA few months ago me(F22) and my husband(M23) of 4 years were drinking at home after we put our toddlers to sleep(M3) & (M1). I like to drink wine but caved in to taking shots with him and it was a fun time, we listened to music and laughed.\n\nThen we started getting emotional, usually we do when we drink, we started having a small argument over household duties and how I do a lot around the house and have been since our boys were born. To keep it short, I started to get more and more drunk and tried walking away from him since I needed time to myself and I remember  he helped me get to the couch to lay down and I was starting to fall asleep. \n\nI am shocked to even be typing this here, but my husband started taking advantage of me. Full on vaginal and orally. I have been sexually assaulted many times since I was about 5 years old and I have told my husband this and cried to him about this before. So for him to do this to me really has me conflicted and hurt. I froze while this was happening because\u2026 1 I\u2019m drunk and can\u2019t believe this was happening and 2 I was just hoping for it to stop. \nNot to mention there were many times before this that I would be sleeping in the bed with him and I\u2019d wake up with my clothes off or I\u2019m wet down there and I\u2019m like \u201cwhy am I wet? Did we fuck??\u201d And he\u2019s like \u201cno I was just touching on you\u201d or I\u2019d wake up to him rubbing his dick on my vagina and trying to slowly put it in. I have told him I don\u2019t like when he does these things when I\u2019m sleeping because of my past experiences.\n\nAfter it happened he had went to the bed upstairs and I remember calling my mom crying my eyes out saying what happened. She was devastated for me and told me I need to do therapy and talk with my husband.\n\nThe morning after he was acting as if nothing happened and I couldn\u2019t just look at him normally\u2026 everything felt so different. \nI asked him if he fucked me and he said \u201cYou mean did we have sex? Yeah we did\u201d I acted like I didn\u2019t remember anything to see if he would tell me the truth and he didn\u2019t. He claimed that I was so horny and saying I wanted him and I went on a few days just not bringing it up because I truly didn\u2019t want this to be my reality\u2026 he took advantage of me and then lied about it to my face!! \n\nI did eventually end up having a talk with him telling him how I remember what happened and he did in fact take advantage of me and he was crying saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made you feel like that but that\u2019s not what happened\u2026 I was really drunk and I thought you were on me\u201d WHICH IS BULLSHIT! He claimed that\u2019s not what happened but he was sorry for making me feel how I felt.\n\nFast forward to now and we have had a few deep talks in the past 2 weeks after not talking about this for a while, and after I used the words RAPE, he changed his story. He told me he\u2019s been through sexual trauma in his childhood and he thinks that\u2019s why that happened and the reason he didn\u2019t tell me the truth when I asked him was because he didn\u2019t want to hurt me and he couldn\u2019t come to terms with accepting what happened himself. All of this \u201cself reflection\u201d he\u2019s doing comes after I tell him I\u2019m really considering divorce and moving back home. I feel like he\u2019s wanting to make these changes now that I want to leave rather than because HE knows he really fucked up.\n\nI have started therapy and he\u2019s currently deployed right now so I have about 2 months away from him with just my kids to reflect and try to start my healing process. I feel VERY conflicted because  I know what he did was rape, and my therapist has told me to use those words, but he also isn\u2019t an abusive man. He comes from a background of manners and protection and his parents have taught him well. He tells me he will do whatever he can to fix our relationship now and that he knows he\u2019s not the type of man to do this it was just a mistake. I know I\u2019m asking advice from people who don\u2019t know me or him but what would you do in this situation? I pretty much have my mind made up but It would help\u2026 if you had a spouse of many years who was a great spouse to you and yall have young kids together, and they raped you but were apologetic would you stay? Or would you leave?\n\nTl;dr:  My husband of 4 years raped me and is apologetic and wanting to do anything to make our marriage last, but only after me saying I want a divorce. If this was you in my situation would you try to make it last just for the kids? Or would you leave for your own good?",

When I get drunk (only happened around 6 times in the past 21 years), I get really horny. Two things I\u2019ve never done while drunk: cheated or even come close to cheating and raping my wife. My wife hates the smell of alcohol, so if I am drunk, I know there\u2019s no action at least until the following morning. If my wife is drunk, even more of a no-go area. \n\nYou explicitly told him you don\u2019t like it (I\u2019m actually shocked that you have to explain to someone that *rape is bad*). It\u2019s really very simple: he raped you and has been raping you in the past. Knowing your history of SA, makes it even more disgusting. Being drunk is never an excuse. I like to think my parents did a good job with me as they were amazing parents and I try to emulate them in everything I do. Your husband was **not raised well if he can a) rape you and then b) try to gaslight you into thinking that\u2019s not what happened**. \n\nIt\u2019s up to you whether or not you stay with a rapist.",

Seeing how there are men who won\u2019t try to have sex with their wives while drunk make it clear that this was 100% wrong. I know the type of safety I bring myself and if he can\u2019t provide me the same security, I am well ok with leaving with my kids. Thank you again",

My husband highly respected my boundaries and took everything slowly and step by step.

        "text": "This is a throwaway account. My husband and I got married last summer. We fight all the time. He's bipolar and has ocd. He expects perfection from me. I constantly tell him that I'm trying my best and I've done a lot to work on myself. He doesn't see it. He always says there's no trying,  there's just doing. He tells me that he's made an effort to be kinder and control his temper, which he has, but tells me that he sees absolutely no progress from me. My kids, and my other family members say they have seen a huge amount of progress from how I was years ago. My previous husband passed away and I fell into the bottle hard. But I've stopped drinking, I stopped hanging out with people who encouraged the bad behaviors. I've been trying to do everything my husband wants and it's never good enough for him. He'll say something terribly hurtful to me and then start screaming or mocking me when I cry. And if I ever snap back, he automatically threatens divorce. He threatens divorce almost every time we argue. I have asked him to stop multiple times and he stopped for a couple of months and then just started it up again within the last couple of weeks. He says that when I cry when he hurts my feelings that I'm having a pity party and he is tired of it and doesn't want to be with me. Which makes me cry and beg him to stay. Deep down he is a good guy. He's very generous to those he cares about and he makes me happy most of the time and I can't breathe when I think of life without him. But I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around him because I never know what I might say or do to set him off. Now he's never gotten physical with me, I have never been afraid of that. But I'm starting to feel like I'm in an emotionally abusive relationship. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm not sure if I can take this anymore, but I feel like I can't live without him. Anyone have any advice?\nTl;dr my husband threatens divorce because I am not perfect and gets angry when I react to his hurtful words.",

                "body": "Hey, the only way you're going to get ahead of this, is if you actually go and file divorce proceedings. You can pause them at any point, but he is doing a power play. So, power play back. \n\nAlso, if I were you, and didn't want to file, I would put him on blast to all of his family members. I would tell on him, everything that he's doing. I would go complain and cry to his mom, to his auntie, to his granny, to everyone and anyone in his family that could give him an earful. \n\nAlso, while I was putting him on blast, I would be emotionally detaching from him. And working on myself, developing my own hobbies, developing my own friendships, and basically slowly developing my own life outside of him. So that, when you are ready to divorce, it's not that big of a shock to your system. \n\nHave you heard of the podcast \"being her\" by margarita nazarenko? There are so many good tips on how to, flip the script, so that you are the one holding the power. You are the prize, not the other way around. And he needs to realize this. And the only way to make him realize this, is to pull back your attention and affection. \n\nPour it into yourself. Men are logical creatures, if you are spending all of your time on him, he's going to think he's so valuable, that nothing could make you want to leave, no matter how much he abuses you. \n\nSo flip it, pour all of your extra time, into yourself. Into self care. If that looks like walking the dog for 2 hours while listening to an audiobook everyday, then that's what that looks like. \n\nHe doesn't get to be in the presence of the feminine, if he's going to try to destroy it.\n\nAlso, he should know better than to make a woman cry. Of course you're going to cry, you have emotions just like every other woman in the world. If he doesn't like that, he can go marry a man, or a robot. \n\nMy husband pulled this sht before, and I had to lean hard into more of my feminine, and more into being not interested in him. Your having so many emotions, and him having the ability to influence your emotions, is what gives him power. So, don't react. Don't give him the satisfaction of having influence over your emotions. Be bored of him, when he is acting in an unfavorable way. Just go spend time, with yourself, by yourself, doing anything, but being around him. That's how you communicate to him that he is boring, when he treats you this way. \n\nYou therefore then do not put any more attention or effort or affection into him. You put it all into you, where you see value. And that will flip the script, and he will also see value there. And then he will start kissing the ground you walk on. \n\nBut I will tell you, it took me ... I would say 2 years, for this to slowly work. And during that time, I was arguing back with him. I was giving it right back, if he was going to threaten divorce, I was going to give it to him. So I told him, file. Do it, I triple dog dare you. I agreed to it. And then you know what happened two days later? When I ignored him for two days, because I was going to be single? He lost his flipping mind. And started backpedaling. Every single time, for two whole years. \n\nYou know why? Because there is a male loneliness epidemic. Women can have sex whenever they want, men have sex when they can. It has always been the way of the world. So remind him. \n\n\nI can't tell you how many times, because we are in a high conflict relationship, I said to him, \"congratulations, due to your behavior, you have one yourself, a month of celibacy\". And follow through. \n\nMessage me for any more tips. \n\n\n\nEdit; I've been married 10 years this October.",

        "post-author": "ThrowRA_shadows25",
        "text": "Hi all,\n\nMy(M38) and my wife (F34) have hit the rocks in a big way. We're together 15 years, married 7. Have 2 kids.\n\nSo context is for about 6-7 months end of last year and beginning of this year I was cold and emotionally distant and it tore my wife apart, it culminated in a big row where some nasty things were said and it all came out that I was doing this to her. Im not proud of it, far from it. So now her trust is gone in me and she doesnt know when it'll come back. She wants to remain friends, so romance and affection was off the table.\n\nSo bit of back story that i've learned from going to my Therapist. I have some serious abandonment issues that stem from my messed up childhood which causes me to not be able to convey what i want in an adult way and I compartmentalize it and stuff it deep down until it reaches busting point and then its a massive fight. \n\nSo this was for the last month and for the first time last night we sat down and talked, like actually talked. We spoke about our respective therapies. She told me that the feeling of trust still isnt back, but if i'm being honest i didn't think a month would be long enough to process the level of hurt she has. We spoke for about 4 hours about everything. However the biggest shock to me is that she feels like she may need to move out for her to properly heal, which broke me inside as the thought of her living somewhere else and my kids sharing 2 houses broke me in 2.\n\nShe feels that if we were to get back together down the road that it would have to be naturally and not forced. She says she still loves me but she needs to find out who she is again before the idea of us can ever be a reality again. I have no problem waiting but im dying inside from the uncertainty. We had 2 long hugs and it felt great, and i feel like its a big step for her to share her feelings with me.\n\nSo my question is from people who have gone through something similar where the love is still there, theres just a mountain of hurt and no trust right now. How did it work out for you? Do you have any advice for me on this? How can i rebuild her trust in me?\n\n**Edit**: Theres been a lot of comments around needing more context or thinking there's more to the story, so ill try and flesh it out a bit more:\n\nMy wife has discovered through her therapy that she is a people pleaser, and that has always been prevalent through our entire relationship. Every time we fought I would default to the victim and expect her to make the first move and apologise, which she always did and I let her. It made my sub conscious/inner child feel loved and validated. However she no longer wants to fulfil this rescuer role as its affecting her mental health\n\nWith regards to *why* I went cold and distant, I wanted more intimacy and closeness which i felt she wasn't giving, and rather than talk to her about it like an adult, I withdrew love and went cold as a test to see if she still wanted me. Incredibly childish and stupid but i cant take it back now. Therapy has helped me a lot in coming to terms with why I did it. But it doesnt fix the damage i've done, but i hope it shows my wife how remorseful i am. \n\nIn terms of people saying she's cheating on me or found someone else, i'd rather not think about it but physically i dont think she has the time. She comes home after work and goes to the gym or stays here. Emotional? I've no idea but outside of checking her phone (which is a massive red flag from my side) i've no way of knowing and ruminating on that would fuel my already high anxiety. \n\ntl;dr I was emotionally distant with my wife and hurt her deeply, she doesn't want reconciliation right now but might want it down the road.",

This is not something that has happened in the last few months, it may seem that way to you but the reality of it is this was the proverbial straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. \n\nI do agree that drafting some clear boundaries and expectations as well as devising an accountability system during the separation will be beneficial. Whoever suggested that earlier is giving out gems today. I also think putting goals in place is brilliant. I kind of think having a timeline is a good idea too, if after 6 months (for example) the relationship isn\u2019t looking better then it\u2019s time to revise some things. I also like what another user said about changing your mindset about this separation, it\u2019s not just about how it affects you. \n\nI\u2019m rooting for yall. Good luck! \n\nUpdateme",

Other factors were present: he was emotionally abusive, he encouraged a poly relationship, engaged in unethical behavior during that arrangement, and mostly discouraged me seeing other men (I wasn't interested anyway). I was madly in love with him and all I wanted was for him to be affectionate and loving towards me, which he was towards his other partners. He attempted to sleep with my best friend at the time and even after it was forgiven, and he promised it would stop, it didn't. \n\nThe last year of our marriage was disastrous, I found about a brain tumor during a serious accident and spiraled after my pleading, for his love, continued to go unheard. So I \"cheated\" (we were poly, but he didn't like the person).\n\nAll I genuinely wanted was to be loved and for him to be affectionate and kind to me. Cheating was my way out of a marriage that was in no way beneficial to me mentally, emotionally, financially, or physically. \n\nSo, while your wife may not have cheated, she might be emotionally checked out enough where she might. She's spent years asking for you to be loving while you continued to behave as if you don't love her. Give her time and continue to SHOW HER that you love her, you might be able to salvage your marriage. \n\nI hope it works out.",

        "post-author": "throwahshmay",
        "text": "UPDATE: \nThanks to some good advice from this thread, we were able to come to a good compromise & I do believe he was remorseful for what he did. I do forgive him, and choose to move forward & try our best to rebuild trust quickly. I know it\u2019s hard to judge situations fully without knowing all background details from a post, but I do believe he is a good person with a few character flaws that he is working on. \n\nOriginal: \nSo my husband and I (both 30s), have a usually pretty healthy relationship with good communication. He does struggle with various addictions, but has never cheated on me while we\u2019ve been married, and I\u2019ve never had any real suspicion that he might. He did cheat once when we were dating, and was on some dating sites on and off the first year we were together, but we went to therapy and moved past everything before we got engaged. Been married happily 6+ years with no other real issues. Then last week, he sent a few texts to an acquaintance he was helping as a favor for a friend. Everything up until last week was normal, non-flirty texts - then out of the blue, he texted her asking if he could help her with something at her apartment, and also admitted to her that he looked her up on OF, and told her she was attractive. \nWhen I found them on his phone (unfortunately I did look through it without permission on a suspicion something was wrong, I don\u2019t usually make a habit of doing so), he said he sent them when he was tipsy and just wanted to know that he still had \u201cgame\u201d. He said he immediately deleted them and felt so guilty and wasn\u2019t going to tell me because he didn\u2019t want to hurt me.\nI wish he wasn\u2019t such a kind person outside of when he does things like this. I\u2019ve eventually had to accept that being with him is being with a compulsive liar that may never change.\nUnfortunately, since I saw the texts a few days ago, we\u2019ve really struggled to be intimate together and I know that it\u2019s hard on him. I keep wondering that if she had said yes to him coming over, would he have and would it have turned into something more? \nThat is where I need advice. Does anyone have experience with a partner sending flirty texts, and moving past it without it reoccurring again? I really don\u2019t want to leave him, and I don\u2019t think I would over something like this, but I feel like I should be moving past it faster than I am. Any helpful advice for what I can do on my part that doesn\u2019t mention divorce would be very appreciated.\n\nTL;DR \nHusband sent flirty text to an acquaintance and I\u2019m struggling to move past it.

I\u2019ve loved him in come capacity practically my whole life. He was my 1st crush. If I\u2019m being honest I\u2019ve never felt like a priority. He isn\u2019t hateful to me, not physically abusive but I feel so alone. We rarely talk and I\u2019m not even putting all the blame on him, I play a role in that, but I do make an effort. We took in his 7 yo nephew 6 months ago and honestly the night before we got him was the last night we truly spent together. And kids are important but there\u2019s been a lot of extenuating circumstances that has caused us to drift further apart. I cry, get upset, rant but nothing ever gets resolved. The only time I truly feel \u201cwanted\u201d is sexually and even then it\u2019s not like he\u2019s putting forth effort.. just grabbing and groping on me after not talking to me all day. I\u2019m so mentally and emotionally exhausted. But  still in love with him and want us to get back to some form of good\u2026 but when I try to talk to him it backfires. I get gaslit and it ends up coming back on me in some form or other. How many wives on here actually PINE for their husbands ?  Like only want THEM? I could be gross and entertain other men to get my emotional needs met but I would never . I just don\u2019t know how to navigate from here outside of professional help. And I\u2019m seriously leaning towards that bc I\u2019m tired of feeling alone and at the bottom of the totem pole.\n\nTL;DR: I want my husband back but I feel we\u2019ve drifted so far apart due to feeling like I\u2019m not a priority",

        "text": "\n\nI have been unhappy for a couple of years. I don't feel like I believe I should when we're together and I don't get excited when we plan for the future. I see myself becoming more emotionally distant as time passes. I considered the catalyst for these feelings and I even though I would like to pinpoint exactly where I took this turn and while I have a few ideas, it's hard to be certain.\n\nI began to only see her as someone I had to 'answer to' or ask permission from. I saw her as a deterrent to living how I wanted to live, not a partner. She doesn't have many friends and would always want me to be around and say \"I just want to show my husband off.\" I know this was coming form a place of affection but it began to bother me. Because when we went out, she would try to dictate what I did. I like to walk around and make new friends. I like to people watch, I like to be social with a lot of people, and I wanted to include her in that but she wasn't into it. I felt like I was on a leash or a prop on a shelf. Being the sole provider of her happiness has become exhausting.\n\nWe are in couples therapy actually took it a step further and began couples AND individual therapy sessions. The individual sessions have helped me immensely. I'm beginning to come to terms with who I am and what I want. The couples sessions are harder. My wife has very out-of-control anxiety. I've known this for a long time. It can be incredibly difficult for me to deliver bad news to her because I'm a people pleaser with the ones I love and I hate seeing them hurt, and when she gets bad news she takes it very hard. I'm struggling to be as open as I can with her both in-person and during our sessions because it will lead to devastation afterwards that I'm too tired to deal with.\n\nWe try to have talks about where we are in this, but I find myself having to omit cold truths to avoid her anxiety and having to pull her back from the brink. I'm drained. I constantly feel defeated. I don't look forward to any serious or deep conversation with her and I'm seeing myself emotionally separate.\n\nI find myself fantasizing about the marriage ending, and it not being my responsibility to constantly pull her from the edge. I think about how coparenting would work, how both her and I have lost so much compatibility, and how we've simply grown apart.\n\nWe make efforts to go out and spend time with each other, but I find myself not wanting to be there. I am still very attracted to her and the sex is great, but the older I get the less importance I find myself putting on that. She's a wonderful person and I harbor no ill will. I don't want her retirement, or half of anything. More often than not, I just want out.\n\nWas couples counselling just bargaining and delaying the inevitable? Did I wait too long to admit to her and myself how distant I was becoming? I'm really trying to get the spark back, but it seems to slip further away every day.  \n  \n tl;dr : I feel like my marriage is on life support. I've lost the spark and I don't know how to get it back.",

Would you want to get the spark back? \n\nMarriage is along commitment and from what I can tell it evolves over time.

Being the one to experience everything without her being on the same level, because you have to deal with both your emotions as well as hers. I get that. My husband wasn't growing (mentally) at the same pace I was for a long while due to me going through over 5 years of individual therapy to get a hold of my own demons. He's been in individual therapy for over a year now, and it has done him wonders. The hard part about marriage is that sometimes, we need time apart to rediscover ourselves. And no, that doesn't mean living in separate residences or breaking up our marriage. It just means time apart. Sounds like that's where you are, but probably not where she is due to her anxiety.\n\nThis is hard. Is -she- in individual therapy as well? Or is it just you? Because if she's not in individual therapy, she really needs to be. If she's not and doesn't want to work on her own mental well-being outside of her relationship with you... \ud83e\udee4 Carrying all the emotional weight of the relationship can be exhausting. I have put that on my husbands shoulders sometimes, too. It's hard when you're as codependent as I am not to. But I've also been in individual therapy for over 5 years, so I can pinpoint where I am going wrong, or be told directly what I'm doing at not have it break me when I need to take a step back and redirect myself. Couples counseling will only work when your both working on yourselves and are in full control over how you handle yourself. She can't face the hard truths without breaking down?

We\u2019ve been married a year and a half now, both 30 and been together since high school. We\u2019ve been living together the last 2.5 years. \n\nOver the years, there have been many incidents \u2014 he\u2019s lied about drinking, hidden alcohol (even recently in reusable pouches around the house), and has had patterns of using substances like weed in secret. I\u2019ve found myself catching him over and over, only for him to get angry or dismissive when I bring it up. He calls me petty, flips the blame, or shuts down emotionally. Sometimes he says things like, \u201cThis is why I won\u2019t tell you anything anymore,\u201d or \u201cThis is why therapy doesn\u2019t work.\u201d He\u2019ll talk about his feelings only to say I throw them in his face.\n\nBut I don\u2019t yell. I try to validate him. I try to explain that the issue isn\u2019t just the drinking \u2014 it\u2019s how he handles it, hides it, and then lashes out. I\u2019ve made every effort to understand and be patient, especially now that I\u2019m pregnant and more vulnerable than ever. But he either walks away, minimizes it, or tells me to \u201ctrust him\u201d without doing anything to rebuild that trust.\n\nIt feels like I\u2019m in this relationship alone. I feel scared about our future and whether this will ever change. I\u2019ve tried keeping a list of incidents because they happen at least once a month. I know some people would say \u201cleave,\u201d but it\u2019s complicated. We\u2019ve been together a long time. I\u2019ve believed him every time he said he\u2019d change. But now I find myself wondering if I\u2019ll end up raising this baby on my own emotionally, even if he\u2019s physically here.\n\nI just need to hear from others who understand \u2014 who\u2019ve been through something similar, or who can remind me that I\u2019m not crazy for feeling hurt, disappointed, and confused. If you\u2019ve been here\u2026 how did you cope? How did you know when enough was enough? Or what helped you stay strong?\n\nTL;DR: I\u2019m pregnant and my husband keeps lying, hiding alcohol, and shutting down emotionally when I try to talk about it. I\u2019ve tried to be understanding and supportive, but I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m in this alone. I\u2019m scared for our future and just need support or insight from anyone who\u2019s been through something similar.\n\nEDIT: our first year living together I didn\u2019t know or see any signs of alcohol abuse like this or overconsumption. He didn\u2019t even smoke weed. At least not that I noticed. \nAfter we got engaged, going into year 2 of living together that\u2019s when I started finding out or realizing but it still wasn\u2019t often enough for me to know or notice. Post wedding he kept telling me how the thing he wants most in life is a family, growing a family and being the man and father his father wasn\u2019t. But I didn\u2019t know we\u2019d be getting to this point with alcohol as coping or weed as coping. He really did hide it really well\u2026 until he didn\u2019t. And now this is where we\u2019re at and why too.. so despite knowing him all these years, these last two years are really when I\u2019ve seen this side. I never have before. ",

So I empathize completely with that feeling and those emotions but there are times he tries to fill that pain and void with drinking excessively - this happens maybe once a month? Maybe ? And that\u2019s when he lies or hides it and has admitted it\u2019s embarrassing and she\u2019s ashamed of those actions so he is remorseful. However the other pattern I notice is when we drink\u2026 even socially, he\u2019s the first to drink quickly, or reach for the hard liquor, or sometimes the only one drinking even at social events - he can\u2019t say no. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a red flag per se but I know it isn\u2019t a good habit paired with the reason why he goes on a bender sometimes. \n\nMy worry is that overtime it will get worse.

        "text": "I'm seeking advice. This is a throwaway account as my husband uses reddit.\n\nI'm worried that I am overlooking some very large red flags. I (29F ) and my husband (32M) have been together ten years, married eight. We got married very young and were admittedly not very good at communicating. I think we have gotten better with time but we are certainly not perfect.\n\nSomething I have been concerned about for awhile now is that we don't really talk about conflict every. When something happens and we have a fight, or something upsets him, he completely shuts down and won't talk about it. He will take space and not talk to me for anywhere from a few hours to a few days, and then once he is \"over it\" things go back to normal. But we never have a discussion.\n\nTwo things about this:\n\n1. I am aware that people resolve conflict and deal with negative emotions differently. I do not need space and would prefer to discuss things immediately until we are both feeling better or resolved. I know he needs space when he or I are upset and I respect that. However, he does also know that when he blatantly ignores me or never discusses things that this hurts me. I have communicated it. \n\n2. Without too much detail that isn't mine to share, he had very abusive parents. His mother is a controlling narcissist. His father is a passive and verbally abusive alcoholic. I think he has a tendency to shut down because he was forced to his whole life.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is should I be concerned that this is more than just lack of communication? I do my best to be understanding of what he needs when we have disagreements or he is upset, but also it hurts me very deeply when he ignores me or point blank refuses to talk to me about things. And I have said before that this hurts me a lot and he sees me cry about it at times. But he still responds to conflict this way. Is this just something we differ on? I just sometimes struggle with feeling like if he really cared for me he would make an attempt to discuss things.\n\n  \nTL;DR: My husband shuts down when he is upset and never resolves things with discussion and it hurts me, but he still does it. Should I be concerned?",

Look up Gottman's Four Horsemen, specifically Stonewalling, see if that fits. Also Internal Family Systems to give yourself a bit more understanding. Not suggesting bringing these things up directly to him (or maybe yes, but I can't advise when and in what way, that depends on your dynamics), but for yourself at least. But he needs to recognize your feelings and that they matter, and that you two need to do some work, both together and separately. Sounds like he needs to work on better ways to deal with his emotions and conflict resolution, especially if he wasn't taught that/ provided good examples growing up. Again, not saying to tell him that - it may be better that comes out in counseling, either marriage counseling or his own individual therapy (which may come out of marriage counseling).",

        "text": "Okay, I am 22 f and I am getting married early in 2026 (about 7 months from now). I have been starting to get my bridesmaids to send me pictures/links of the dresses they are wanting so they can be ordered on time and have adulterations if need be for the wedding. One of my bridesmaids who was appointed as the assistant MOH (the MOH has a lot of health concerns and needs the extra help) came to me and told me that the color I was wanting, some kind of gray or even a dark gray, was basically nowhere to be seen on what she knows to be reputable websites. So, knowing this I started to go on the hunt to find something and was asking her what she thought about certain websites that did have the color I was looking for. She told me they were equivalent to Shein, fair enough. I thought we were having a good conversation trying to figure it out when she sent me \u201cWell it\u2019s no longer being sold\u201d then the next text of \u201cI\u2019m about to back out\u201d. When I saw this I was obviously very surprised and asked what she meant. That is when she sent me \u201cPlease figure out the dresses.\u201d Then \u201cIt\u2019s normally never this much work\u201d mind you she looked at all of 3ish websites by what I had seen and been told. Up until this point she has not had a lot of involvement in planning the wedding other than creating the discord server we are using to plan everything. So I can only come up with a few reasons for why she might have said that, 1 she was just trying to hurt me in the moment and knew it would, 2 people have been asking a lot of her behind the scenes and she has not said anything to me, 3 she just had been looking for an out and this was her chance. In all honesty the threat really REALLY upset me as we have been good friends for a long time. I\u2019m worried that if we get this solved that a similar situation will pop up in the future. Should I just nip this in the bud and ask her to step down to just be a guest if she would like to still come? I\u2019m really confused and hurt and I need to talk to her in the next few days about this and I\u2019m not sure what to say. Any advice is very much appreciated. \n\nTL;DR she was disrespectful, threatened to leave the wedding over a bridesmaids dress color, and really made me angry. Should I ask her to step down? Because I\u2019m worried about this behavior will continue at other small inconveniences.\n\nUPDATE:\nI spoke with her today. We had a good conversation and she is stepping out of the wedding. Apparently, the reason she snapped at me, was having a kinda rough day, where her computer monitor died and her tower stopped working with the power source and she also might be getting a job that would make it hard for her to come. However, I didn\u2019t much get an apology so as far as the wedding goes, I will send her an invitation and if she\u2019s there great; if she\u2019s not then it\u2019s not gonna bother me very much. As for the friendship going forward, we will have to see. Thank you to those who gave me advice.",

        "text": "Dear Redditors of r/marrigeadvice,\n\nMy wife (F33) and I (M34) have been together since 2018, married in 2021, and have two wonderful daughters, born early 2023 and late 2024. I'm struggling significantly with our relationship and could really use some outside perspective.\n\n**The Core Issues:**\n\n1. **Complete Lack of Intimacy:**\n   * During both pregnancies, my wife experienced extreme discomfort, meaning all intimacy, and often even kissing, was off the table. I understood and supported her through this.\n   * Our second child was conceived on the first try, so the \"no intimacy\" period essentially rolled from one pregnancy into the next with almost no break.\n   * Since our first child, she's been very dismissive of any physical contact, especially around her chest (where I used to enjoy giving affectionate touches), stating it's now solely a source of food as she's been breastfeeding.\n   * A significant part of intimacy for me is giving pleasure. I genuinely get more satisfaction from her climaxing than my own and thus, I always prefer to focus on the woman first. Related to that, I particularly love and enjoy going down on women, it's a rooted part of my way of satisfying a woman. To begin with, it was also a big part of my satisfaction of our intimacy, but she has rejected receiving any oral stimulation ever since we got married for no unknown reason.\n   * I have offered putting in fake meetings in my calendar, if she is feeling any \"skin hunger\" and I have also told her I'm happy to just focus on her pleasure if she's not up for more or doesn't feel up to reciprocating, but these offers have also been rejected.\n   * When we *were* intimate (very rarely during the pregnancies), it felt transactional, often just using our hands, as if she wanted it over with quickly. I can't even remember having any actual intercourse during the pregnancies.\n   * Since our second daughter was born in late 2024, there has been absolutely zero intimacy \u2013 not even manual stimulation. Kissing is rare, and she's even rejected hugs, saying she's \"fed up\" with physical contact due to the constant breastfeeding.\n   * I used to be very flirty, and it ~~is~~ was a natural part of my humor. But after being told \"not in front of the kids\" and responses like \"what\" with a condescending look when we were alone, I turned it down tenfold \\~ rarely ever being flirtatious. However, regardless of this, one day when I aired a very innocent flirtatious joke, she's shut this down, calling me \"sex fixated\" even when I'd toned it down to almost nothing. I now rarely compliment her physically for fear of this reaction.\n      * \"Waow, that dress really sits well on you\" could be considered a reference to her curvature (which is beautiful) has become \"That is a pretty dress\".\n   * A few months ago, I discovered she uses a Womanizer Premium (Air-suction clitoral stimulator) when I leave for work (I'm mostly remote but go in occasionally). I found it hidden in our bathroom and since then I've been tracking it's orientation. Subsequent to nearly every shower or when I'm out of the house for work, I find it oriented differently and often with a scent of recent usage, which I then clean off to alert me for next times usage (Nothing else is in that oversized box in the back of our cupboard). Knowing she's seeking pleasure on her own while consistently rejecting any form of intimacy with me is devastating. I had been telling myself it was \"just a phase\" related to pregnancy and hormones, but this discovery has shattered that hope.\n2. **Communication Breakdown & Feeling Invalidated:**\n   * I try to be as supportive as possible. I do most of the cooking, cleanup, putting the older child to bed, entertaining the baby when she is not being breastfed, and general tidying to allow her to rest and focus on the baby when breastfeeding, hoping we can have some quality time in the evening (We have about 30-60 minutes of \"us\" time per day).\n   * My attempts to share my experiences or feelings are often dismissed or invalidated.\n      * **Example 1:** One morning, after a very challenging hour and a half trying to manage both kids outside in the rain (baby wouldn't sleep otherwise), so my wife could sleep after a nightmare of a night with a crying baby, I tried to tell her about it. Before I could get through a quarter of the story, she cut me off with, \"That is how I feel every day when I pick up the kid,\" with no empathy or acknowledgment of my effort, completely invalidating my experience. A simple \"I get how hard that can be\" would have meant the world.  **To put it in perspective**, I regularly present to large audiences (500+ people) as part of my job. I know with certainty that public speaking on even a tenth of that scale would be incredibly difficult for her. If she ever attempted it and wanted to share her experience, I would listen intently and validate her feelings, no matter how minor her concerns might seem compared to my routine experiences. I would never dream of dismissing or invalidating her struggle, yet that's how I felt in that moment.\n      * **Example 2:** I wanted to *air the idea* of me staying home one weekend from a family visit to finish an urgent house project we were behind on. She had an immediate emotional breakdown, crying and yelling that the idea should never have even been voiced. We've never missed a family event prior to this, and I was just trying to discuss a possibility, so it caught me completely off guard.\n   * Because of reactions like these, I've started keeping my experiences and thoughts to myself. I'm scared of how she'll react to almost anything I say that isn't purely functional.\n3. **Impact on Me:**\n   * I feel like an empty shell. I love my children intensely, and they are my joy, but outside of my time with them, I feel like I'm just a housekeeper and a provider. The love and affection I want to give my partner feels like it's rotting inside me.\n   * I'm scared I'm wasting my life and that I won't find happiness in my marriage again.\n   * My work performance is declining. I do a lot of public speaking, and I'm struggling to bring my usual engagement and optimism. My creativity is also struggling, so my LinkedIn posting schedule is running dry and I can barely find the energy to respond to all of the people writing to me on LinkedIn (which is harming my job, my position, my relevance and purpose)\n   * I have a very small support system (a few friends I talk to bi-weekly). My wife and I are seen as the \"winning couple\" in my family, so I don't feel I can talk to them. My brothers and I don't have a history of telling each other anything until shit hits the fan and it's too late to intervene anyways. My wife, on the other hand, has a large group of friends and sisters she's very close with and sees/talks to frequently. She seems to be thriving with everyone but me.\n\n**What I'm Looking For:**\n\nI would really appreciate any outside perspective. If you've been in this situation from either vantage point, or know anyone in a similar situation or simply just want to offer advice... I'm all ears! I am also heavily considering seeing a psychologist/therapist to understand what's happening, whether I'm unknowingly contributing to this in ways I don't see, or to get tools to communicate better. I don't think she *intends* to cause this much harm, but the cumulative effect of issues since we got married is crushing me.\n\n* Am I misinterpreting things? Is this an extreme version of a normal phase after having young children?\n* How can I even begin to address these issues with her when even small suggestions or sharing my feelings can lead to such negative reactions?\n* Has anyone been through something similar and found a way forward?\n\nI love the idea of the wife I married, and I love our family. I just don't know how to fix this disconnect.\n\n***\n\n**TL;DR:** M34 with F33, two young kids (2023 & 2024). Complete lack of intimacy for years, worsening to zero physical contact (even hugs rejected) since second baby. Wife uses sex toy when I'm away but rejects all advances from me. My attempts to share feelings or even practical ideas are often met with dismissal or emotional outbursts. I do a lot to support the family. Feeling like an empty shell, work suffering, deeply unhappy. Considering therapy. How can I approach this and try to reconnect?\n\n***Disclaimer:*** *The text above has been co-authored using the help of a LLM as my original free-text was unstructured, no grouping, simply just thoughts of all of our issues with a few examples here and there.

You operating with her wants/needs/desires as your top priority only adds to her mental load, she ends up managing much of what you do and how you do it, often because you ask her to do just that. (even things that seem as innocent as \"how can I help\", \"anything I can do for you\", etc, can easily be overused)\n* Your expectations often add another burden, on top of managing what you do and when you do it she is supposed to provide validation to you as well. You taking the kids in the rain so she could rest is a perfect example of this. The issue isn't that she invalidated your feelings, the issue is you were seeking validation.\n* Sex and physical affection are just another burden, you aren't treating this as a mutual experience but a way for you to feel connected and valued. It is more or less you seeking validation\n\n  \nYou have to learn how to prioritize yourself, you have to find your individual motivation and build real self confidence. Being a people pleaser and giving to get, to over simplify, comes from your lack of self esteem, but there are many other things here that highlight the fact you don't value yourself.\n\nRemember expectations are just premeditated resentment. Beyond that when things fail to workout as you had expected you need to be honest with yourself instead of trying harder at the same things, often putting more effort into things that already didn't work.\n\n Start with the book No More Mr. Nice Guy",

You are absolutely right about monitoring the vibrator use. **That is an invasion of her privacy**, born out of my own desperation to understand if her rejection was a total lack of desire or specific to me. It is not something I'm proud of, nor is it something I'd have ever imagined myself doing in a normal state of mind. It is a flawed way to seek malicious validation of my thoughts that she might have a specific lack of desire for me, and I regret it every time as it hurts every time... Also... Point noted regarding the quoted expression at the end of your comment...\n\nIn regards to when your husband handles his part of the responsibilities. My wife keeps a mental list of all the things she wants done and she builds this list through her day on parental leave. I have no clue what is on the list, nor does she share it with me. Some things just doesn't seem like she wants me to do. I can't fold the kids clothes like she wants (All square and within certain tolerances) nor can I separate the clothes properly when washing (this hue of pink is ok with lighter colours and this hue of pink is not).\n\nI'm all in for lightening her load and I hope it comes across that way in my post above. I'm doing as many practical things every single day in hopes that she'll lighten her mood, open up about her day, feelings or anything. But there is no acknowledgement of whether I'm doing anything right \\~ only judgement when I'm doing it wrong. How would you want your husband to approach you to understand, if there is anything you would want him to do more often / take full control over?\n\n.. Also note, I regarding to sorting the clothes prior to washing, I've tried standing on front of her to sort our clothes into piles, so we could do it together, but also in order to avoid her judgement of not separating things properly. That didn't work as *\"she might as well just do it herself then\"*",

HORMONES and being needed by two little babies...is very very taxing on mommas.  I remember not really wanting to be touched really- and you are always \"needed\" which is a beautiful thing...but also very hard.  It can be overwhelming sometimes as a mom. \n\n Now that being said- you are also part of this relationship and also need to feel seen and heard.   Do you think you come across as \"needy\" to her right now??  How can you take any pressure off her to help out?  What is her love language? \n\nRight now...it might just be super wise to work out some counseling or therapy? You may have to rely on patience when it comes to the intimacy part...and have a heart to heart with wife about all that.  Shifting your expectations might help. But if you come at her in a \"needy' way...it might not go over well.\n\nWhen was the last time she had a few days by herself...or even just a few hours?  When was the last time you guys had \"fun\" and a good laugh or had time to reconnect? Is there any help from family where you could get a night out?  BTW...this would be a no-strings-attached kind of night...just trying to connect, chat, and not pressure about anything?  You have to talk to her- but it sounds like this is NOT intentional at all...she just is TAXED out emotionally and physically.  I know I felt that way...and it gets better for sure.  \n\nThere are seasons in marriage for sure.  You do need a support group- but taking this to counseling might be the place to go.  You def aren't alone in this I'm sure. Many men, I think feel the difference when kids come. It changes things...but remember that you are VITAL part of this marriage. You are NEEDED.  FAthers are so important...and sometimes get overlooked.  Dig into the underlying issue here...just feeling really unseen and unheard and she may feel that way as well.  Approach is key to this all.  Many times- intimacy (not always sexual) and connecting with your wife, creating a new special memory- reminding each other WHY you love one another-is important.",

And what does he need to change to be a better person for his spouse? and how to bring back the intimacy that they had prior to being married? He did a poor job of explaining himself but he is asking for help. OP barely has a support system, I can see why he just doesn't know how to fix this and is going about it all wrong. It also seems like the communication style has changed, post kids and he's still trying to connect with his wife the way they used to as oppossed to adjusting to her new way of connecting. Even for someone who communicates for a living this time period in life can be brutal.\u00a0\n\n\nOP, definitely get therapy. I do agree with others that you need to build connections outside of your wife and kids. Individual and marriage counseling would be so beneficial for your marriage right now. You guys need some alone time. Kids free, non-sexual, non intimate kids free time. Just so you can reconnect would be amazing for you guys, right now.",

Right now if she agrees to have sex with you and you\u2019re trying to get her to give you BJs, do doggy, stick a finger in her butt (unless that\u2019s what she wants) is only going to make her not want to have sex right now. \nHer sole purpose is to care for those kids and your sole purpose is to care for her.

Be patient.   As breastfeeding tapers off, her libido should return.\n\n>  Since our first child, she's been very dismissive of any physical contact, especially around her chest (where I used to enjoy giving affectionate touches), stating it's now solely a source of food as she's been breastfeeding.\n\nIt's understandable she doesn't want to fondling her breasts.  If she's breastfeeding, it may not feel good.    You said you really get satisfaction from her enjoyment.   If this is true, why would you keep trying to mess with her breasts when you know she doesn't like it?  \n\n>  A significant part of intimacy for me is giving pleasure. I genuinely get more satisfaction from her climaxing than my own and thus, I always prefer to focus on the woman first. Related to that, I particularly love and enjoy going down on women, it's a rooted part of my way of satisfying a woman. \n\nIf giving is important, you need to give her things she wants.   Not things you want to give or things you think she should want.  \n\n\n> To begin with, it was also a big part of my satisfaction of our intimacy, but she has rejected receiving any oral stimulation ever since we got married for no unknown reason.\n\nAsk her why. \n\n> Since our second daughter was born in late 2024, there has been absolutely zero intimacy \u2013 not even manual stimulation. \n\nAsk her why.

Stop being a detective. Leave it alone.  If you want to understand her interest in it, communicate.

Judging by her reaction, if say she never gets validation or empathy for it.  \n\n> If she ever attempted it and wanted to share her experience, I would listen intently and validate her feelings, no matter how minor her concerns might seem \n\nShe just did it when she reminded you she feels that way every day.

I love my children intensely, and they are my joy, but outside of my time with them, I feel like I'm just a housekeeper and a provider. The love and affection I want to give my partner feels like it's rotting inside me.\n\nSet your feelings aside for just one second.  Is it possible she feels much the same way - just a housekeeper and nanny?  A lot has to be given up when a new baby arrives. She's exhausted taking care of two little kids.   She needs emotional intimacy, and I'm guessing that isn't happening much?   She needs a break from her chest being fondled, and you don't understand that.   She asked for a break in the sex focused comments, and that's really upsetting you.    \n\n> I'm scared I'm wasting my life and that I won't find happiness in my marriage again.\n\nWhy?  Because a breastfeeding mom caring for two tiny kids is too exhausted to have sex?    Isn't the marriage more to you than just sex?    Why not put more emphasis on the other parts for awhile, be patient, and see what happens when breastfeeding ends? \n\n\n> My work performance is declining. I do a lot of public speaking, and I'm struggling to bring my usual engagement and optimism. \n\nYou're blaming your wife for your work performance.  That doesn't seem fair given the situation. If you need to talk to someone, consider doing therapy.   It'll give you clarity about your feelings.  \n\nI highly recommend you do marriage counseling.

Talk to her about maybe getting even a night away where the two of you could reconnect and have a conversation privately.  \n\nI wonder if you were to talk to her about some of the challenges you\u2019re feeling with intimacy and other things and you were able to do it at a place where she wasn\u2019t going to be dealing with demanding small children maybe she would be more likely to have a conversation \n\nI completely can see how you feel tapped out here and she also feels overwhelmed. I think you both need to come to a place where either you want to move forward together or you don\u2019t. But with small children and until it\u2019s hard to have these moments of privacy and connection",

From my vantage point, I try to be as supporting and understanding as I can with the time I have, I know that this situation does not get any better if I become an opposing force in any way, so even if I reluctantly carry most practical things some days, I try to keep in mind that it has to be done either way.\n\nWe have talked about dedicated time away from the kids, but as she is breastfeeding the youngest girl, we at least need to have one of them with us. I am still very positive about the idea as one baby is comparatively a lot more calm than also having the older girl with us.\n\nI truly want to move forward together with her, both for the sake of our children not having divorced parents, but also because I deeply love my wife. I can't imagine a world without her, even thought I can't imagine myself surviving in the current state of our marriage either.",

The former is infinitely less demanding on a touched out, breastfeeding human.\n\nReading posts like these while being pregnant and knowing how overstimulated I'm going to be once baby is here makes me realise how totally and utterly clueless some men are about the physical realities of bearing children and breastfeeding. I mean everything from hormones and brain chemistry to the enormous physical toll pregnancy, post-partum recovery and breastfeeding takes on the body.\n\nIt IS a phase, it just isn't over yet. It doesn't help that your wife went very quickly from one pregnancy to the next. Resuming anything close to normal intimacy is going to take much longer than you anticipate, particularly with two infant children.\n\nSex in marriage comes in seasons. Baby time is, in most marriages, not sexy time. Baby time will be over before you know it so just make the most of it. Help out without seeking validation or reward, sexual or otherwise and it'll set your romantic life up MUCH better in the long-term.\n\nIt's normal to feel sexually frustrated and even for it to impact your work, but if you manage your expectations better, you'll find it easier to manage the frustration. Your wife is in the trenches of motherhood right now, but give it time (lots of it) and if you've been the supportive partner she needed, your bedroom will be anything but dead.",

But he has shown he is consistently trying to help and is willing to help more. He has put aside his feelings alot to allow her to deal with things. \n\nHere is the biggest thing people forget in marriage is if you really love someone that you making sure they are happy and needs met should be your first priority. That doesn\u2019t mean there are going to be seasons where things are different. But kids are no excuse to completely forget about your spouse. \n\nI\u2019m sorry. I know I am going to get a lot of push back for this response. But his needs should not take a total backseat because know she has more responsibilities. Just like he shouldn\u2019t take a back seat realizing she has more on her plate now and be patient and understanding. Also step up and fill more roles. \n\n\nThese are always hard to respond to because we only get one perspective. But we are talking about like 3 years or more of this man completely trying to put aside one of his biggest needs to be loving and understanding. To step up and love in spite of he needs being met and most of these responses are well she has a lot going on. \n\nThat\u2019s just a bs excuse then to use something like a vibrator and people to make excuses of oh she is just over touched. Bs. No she is just being self serving and only thinking about her and her feelings during this time without ever considering her husband and his needs. Marriage is a two way street. Where this is giving and understanding needed both ways. If someone is constantly asking for their need to be met and constantly sitting that aside to show love towards the other person. Then that person uses another method to get off themselves with out their spouse involved or communication that is 100% self serving. Thats not what marriage is.

You should really supportive and patient so kudos for that! \n\nHer boobs just aren\u2019t the same for her. Being that I\u2019ve nursed 5 children, they kind of just go numb. And they\u2019re always touched so it\u2019s not exciting at the moment. One day when they are all hers again she might enjoy them being played with. For now it just feels like a child is touching them even if it\u2019s you. Nipples have minimal feeling from being nursed on. \n\nAlthough the poster above says what makes a lot of sense, she takes care of herself because it\u2019s her quiet alone time with no expectations from her to enjoy or to please someone else, I agree it\u2019s causing her to not have any desire left for you. That\u2019s painful. But both ways are understandable. \nMaybe you could talk to her about using the toy together. That you\u2019d love for her to wait for you. \n\nMen need sex differently than women. It fills their ego (which is good for them for work), to feel love and appreciation and other things. Women don\u2019t need it the same way although it bonding for both. Women bond strongly from sex. \nI agree also that you shouldn\u2019t be following her toy around. She uses it. Now let\u2019s find a way you can either be involved or encourage her to possibly hold off a few days and give you a chance to prove you\u2019re better than that! \n\nI encourage a date night or however long she can stay away from her nursing baby. I would ask her \u201cis X night a good night for you to go _____ \u201c\u2014YOU fill in the blank. don\u2019t ask her. Tell her. You can ask her for babysitters phone number or ask a relative you know she\u2019s comfortable with watching the girls. And tell her \u201cI\u2019ll ask so and so if they\u2019re free to come watch the girls that night\u201d the more you plan and take the mental load off of her for that entire night the better. You can tell her you\u2019ll be available to watch the girls at X time so she has time to shower and get ready. \n\nIf she\u2019s snappy that day. For whatever reason I know a few women they get snappy when they\u2019re expected to be happy and excited. Just hug her. Idk all my friends which their husband would just hug them instead of snap back. \n\nTelling her things like \u201ci love you. I miss you. I miss us\u201d \n\n\nYou should also find happiness somewhere outside. Like a hobby. Like something you\u2019re excited about. Your wife will also feel less \u201cneeded\u201d to be your entire source of happiness \n\nListen it\u2019s a lot to constantly be putting efforts into being a good mother. A good child. A good wife. And sadly being a wife is taken for granted and the efforts are much harder because it takes more from us. Being a mother and wanting to do better in a way comes naturally to most and you can\u2019t help but love the kids automatically and unconditionally. Your husband is a love you need to invest many parts of you into. It\u2019s worth it. It\u2019s amazing. But the efforts are different because it means more and takes more. Naturally you won\u2019t let your child starve. Your husband can technically take care of himself in every way that your children cannot. So the relationship efforts are deeper and more thoughtful. Which is a lot at the end of the day giving to your kids. Again worth it!!! But more mindful. \n\nShe loves you. I\u2019m sure she misses you too even if she\u2019s unaware of it. \n\nPlan the date. Plan everything. Take care of dinner for the girls. Give her time to get ready. Get the babysitter. Love her through that whole day even if she tries to sabotage it. Idk what love language is but if it\u2019s words of affirmation there\u2019s a book you can get from Amazon \u201cwhat I love about you\u201d https://a.co/d/gWesZFj",

Whether it\u2019s things I like, things I ask for, or things I\u2019ve explained multiple times, there\u2019s a pattern of being tuned out.

        "text": "My husband and I have been married for 13 years, and in that time have built a trucking business together. We own several semitrucks and my husband drives one of them long haul over the road. We also own several properties that we rent out. \n\nMy husband's only responsibility is the truck he drives- I do everything else with the trucking business (lining up freight for all trucks, invoicing, licensing, taxes, etc.), the rental properties (lease agreements, property management, collecting rent etc.) and all the domestic tasks of running a household (cooking, cleaning, yardwork, lining up repairmen, paying the bills on time, etc.). I have also taken on a side job as a part time bookkeeper for a local business.\n\nThe amount of hours that are put into the trucking business is definitely lopsided as my husband has to be away from home about half the year. I have always acknowledged this and have always tried to show him how much I appreciate him by making sure he doesn't have to worry about anything else besides driving/maintaining the truck. Also, because we don't have kids, I always tried to fill up my extra time with other jobs outside of our business to make the working time more \"even\". (All the money we make goes into the same pot).\n\nI have tried very hard to be a good wife - always praising him, showing him affection, always making sure he has a clean house to come home to, good homecooked meals, keeping myself in shape/put together etc. But the problem is, I do not feel appreciated at all as a spouse. I feel like being his wife is just an extension of the business and everything I do in our marriage is simply expected and does not need to be reciprocated. \n\nI have told him several times that he makes me feel unappreciated as a wife and his response is to call me a nag. He pretty much implies that he can treat me however he wants because he's the one who has to sacrifice being away from home so much. \n\nI'm a very blunt person and I did come right out and tell him that he is not a good husband to me. I said, we are great business partners and have built an amazing life together, but he simply does not see me as his wife; he is unable to separate me as his wife vs his business partner and I don't know where that leaves our marriage. \n\nHas anyone else been in this situation? How did you navigate it? \n\ntl;dr: My husband only sees me as a business partner who does not put in as many hours as he does, therefore he doesn't treat me like a wife. How to navigate?\n\n",

I didn't open it, and his grandmother brought it to him in the hospital. \n\nWhen he came back everything in the box was apparently stuff he liked, his favorite candy, some legend of Zelda stuff. To me it looked like a lovingly curated care package. But he told me straight to my face that it was all a giveaway he won that he forgot he entered. I left it alone until this morning when I found the card that came with it all. Written in very feminine handwriting, mostly just explaining how it was a care package, and then at the end she wrote \"Thinking of you always.\"\n\nSo am I wrong to be upset over it?\n\n*UPDATE* I confronted him about it, and of course I was right. This woman is in a whole other state, but he admitted to having a month long flirtationship with Brandy while he was on surgery bedrest, even says that brandys husband knows about my husband and is slowly becoming okay with it. We had a 3 hour long talk about how lying to me was wrong. He admitted he's been a shitty partner and needs to do better. Since we have a 3 year old daughter and I'd have nowhere to go if I left with her...we had gotten to almost this amicable place...where he still insisted he deserves to be poly despite lying to me...but promised to do better by me and keep me informed of any new developments...\n\nBut it all went to shit when I found out what his twitch handle is.\nPoly_[his occupation]\nAnd yes I know i shouldn't be protecting him but I don't want to deal with the fallout if he gets banned.\n\nSee, while I knew he was still openly being poly...I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS LEADING WITH IT IN SUCH A PUBLIC WAY. And he says I'm free to have my own partners, but that doesn't really make things better for me because agonizing over the lies is giving me constant headaches...not even sure what to do anymore.\n\n\"Tl;dr\"am I wrong for being upset my husband lied about a care package from another woman being a giveaway prize he forgot he won?",

No I get it.  You\u2019d rather not be in this situation. You\u2019d rather your \u201chusband\u201d no be the out and proud poly- underwater basketweaver or whatever his profession is. You wish desperately that this wasn\u2019t your reality, that maybe you are the one making too big a deal of nothing, esp since EAP\u2019s husband is \u201ccoming around\u201d. According to the unreliable narrator in charge of rewriting your experience. \n\nIdk what state you are in or if you have a prenup of any kind, if the bank accounts/house/cars have your name on them too. I\u2019m not a lawyer or a marriage counselor. If you don\u2019t want to make a move because you literally believe you are incapable of surviving on your own w a small child, or if that represents something worse than death to you. Being the cast aside single parent begging for crumbs, collecting cans on the side of the highway w your small child, living in a dark and greasy tenement smelling of burning rubber and a miasma of the great unwashed and acrid smoke rising to the heavens leaving only cold ashes of dreams. \n\nSounds dreadful. But you are a grown azz woman, a lady, a mother committed to showing her daughter- it is crucial this lesson comes from you mama and witnessing your lived experiences- that when your primary relationship goes south and contradicts your morals beliefs and boundaries, you know how to walk away with your head held high, your tongue stilled from badmouthing her other parent, and the confidence that though this is unpleasant and not at all what you had planned or wished for, you faced the thing head on, decisively, and without adultifying your small child as a way to gain moral support or comfort. You need to make an appointment with a lawyer. Check out, interview, three lawyers/firms specializing in family law, of different sizes and sensibilities, and choose the one that resonates with you and can work with you financially. If you don\u2019t have cash set aside a an emergency fund (a person dependent on another\u2019s income should always try to have a little pin money set aside, maybe from using coupons at the grocery store or saving a bit if you get an allowance, that few dollars a week can make you feel less stuck) or a credit card with your name on it, maybe they will advise going to the bank and getting money from joint accounts while it\u2019s still available. Don\u2019t give your husband a heads up about this. You can still change your mind. You may be required to undergo marriage counseling before separating, and that may at least pave the way forward for civil co-parenting, and creating a new normal for you to interact safely in. \n\nMaybe you just \u201cloooooove\u201d him too much to leave. In which case I hope you believe this is a good enough relationship for your daughter because future her will think this is normal adulting/parenting/ grown up family life. And that is a luxury you cannot afford. You are not alone. You feel beat down from this chaotic hamster wheel of lying, manipulation, and trauma. He is breaking his vows on the regular. You don\u2019t need his permission to be done with this! Ffs stop giving him all the power over your life! Its an illusion, like you think if you don\u2019t make the decisions you aren\u2019t responsible for the fallout. But you are because it\u2019s your life and we are all ultimately responsible for our own lives. Cowboy up, mama. Do the hard parts because you have the integrity and strength to make it happen.

        "post-author": "MonkeysMD",
        "text": "I have always been a dog lover and wanted a dog for many years. For a while I had to put off a dog because I lived in an apartment and my work schedule was too busy. 8 years ago my work schedule was calming down and we were finally living in a house, so my husband and I decided it was time to get a dog. My first dog that I have ever owned. We loved our dog and both shared dog related responsibilities. Over the past 2 years my husband's job has gotten a lot busier and he is working longer hours. He mostly works remote from home but does have to take business trips about once a month. I work in a hospital and lately have been working about 8-9 hours a day. About 2 months ago our dog unexpectedly passed away from cancer. Both of us were devastated. Right after she passed my husband moved all of her things into the basement so he wouldn't have to look at them and he did not want to talk about the dog. The day that our dog died my husband also said he would never want another dog because its too painful. I would really like to get another dog to help me with my grief. I had brought this up shortly after the dog passed but it got shot down. I waited a few weeks and brought it up again and my husband firmly says no. He says he cannot get a dog for the foreseeable future and he likes not having the extra responsibilities. I think he is also afraid of the pain of losing another dog that he loves. I brought up the possibility of getting a dog in a few years when his work schedule might calm down but he still said that unless I can guarantee I will do 100% of the work it is still a \"no for him. He also said that I should be ok with not having another dog because \"thats life\". I should also mention that our marriage has been rocky for the past year. We just don't seem to be connecting or communicating well. I had briefly thought about divorce but had stayed in the marriage for a few reasons one of which was because it was the best thing for our dog.  More recently things had been getting a little better, but my dog's death was a big set back for my mood. I am conflicted about what to do. Should I give him more time and then bring this up again? Should I start reconsidering divorce? Or is he correct that I should be an adult and deal with the fact that I can't have another dog right now. The truth is that if we were separated it would be very difficult for me to manage a dog on my own because I am away at work most of the day.\n\ntl;dr Dog recently passed away. Husband does not want to get another dog for a variety of reasons. Not sure what to do",

Just because you want something doesn't automatically mean he has to go along with it no matter how much you try to change his mind.  Build your love for one another first.

Your whole post you mentioned getting a dog and how if you separated you wouldn't be able to have a dog because he wouldn't be around to help. Honestly it sounds more like you are in love with the idea of having someone there to help you with your dog rather than having someone there as your partner. I suggest going to counseling and fix the communication issues that you two have been having. Respect his decision, if you not having a dog is a deal breaker in your marriage, that's fine too.

It is similar if your husband passes away and you quickly get married to help with the pain.  Everyone and even you would likely agree that that is not a wise move.  Instead, embrace the pain, the loss, and the grief.  Learn from it.  It is uncomfortable, but the amount you can learn and gain from it is important.  \n\nYour husband is not ready and is processing things differently than you.

        "text": "I (32F) have always pictured kids in my future. For a while, I was hesitant because of some medical concerns, but I\u2019ve since learned those issues wouldn\u2019t be impacted by pregnancy after all. Regardless, I\u2019ve always been clear with partners: I want children, and that\u2019s a non-negotiable for whoever I marry.\n\nMy husband (we\u2019ve been together since 2019, married in 2022) told me early in our relationship that he wanted children too. That was part of why I moved forward with him so confidently. We even factored it into buying our house last year\u2014I said we should look for something bigger for future kids, and he agreed.\n\nNow that I\u2019m trying to plan when to start a family, he\u2019s told me he actually never wanted kids\u2014he just said he did because he knew how important it was to me. He\u2019s now firmly against having any.\n\nI\u2019m devastated. If the issue was that I *couldn\u2019t* have children due to medical reasons, I think I could make peace with that, even consider ethical adoption. But this feels different. It feels like a betrayal of one of my core values.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried counseling. It helped us align on broader life values, but I still feel this gaping hole. I envisioned *living* out those values while also raising children. Without kids, it\u2019s like a whole part of my life story is just gone.\n\nHere\u2019s the hardest part: I genuinely love my husband. Our relationship has been one of the greatest joys of my life. We\u2019re good together\u2014strong communication, healthy conflict resolution, mutual support. But I also feel like the only way I\u2019ll feel at peace is by pursuing divorce, which is heartbreaking. I never wanted to get married more than once, and I don\u2019t have a long dating history. I\u2019ve always dated seriously with long-term intentions.\n\nAnd now, with my age, I worry that if I don\u2019t pursue motherhood soon, I won\u2019t be able to at all.\n\nI\u2019ve always seen myself as more than just someone\u2019s wife\u2014I want to be a mom, a business owner, a community volunteer. Marriage was only *one* part of my life plan. So now I\u2019m stuck between a life I love with someone I love\u2026 and the life I dreamed of that he no longer shares.\n\nAny advice?\n\n  \n**TL;DR:**  \nI (32F) made it clear to my now-husband (32M) that I wanted kids. He said he did too, but now, years into our marriage, he admits he never actually wanted them. We\u2019ve tried counseling, but I still feel like motherhood is a core part of my identity and purpose. I love him deeply, but I don\u2019t know if I can give up having children.",

I don\u2019t usually use that so lightly but he trapped you into this relationship with a lie that he values the same things you do. That is horrible and unforgiving. \n\nIt would be entirely different if he said that he changed his mind because he\u2019s nervous, realizes he doesn\u2019t like other people\u2019s kids, is scared to be a dad, etc. \nThose things you can work through. But he flat out said he lied. \n\nI don\u2019t doubt he\u2019s a good husband and you both are happy together. But he trapped you and kept you from meeting an equally good man who truly does value the same as you. This is awful. I\u2019m so sorry.",

We finally moved back to my home country, bought a house, pretty much \u201csettled down\u201d and he says he doesn\u2019t want kids. I pushed back and he snapped and said \u201cI don\u2019t want to be held to something I said in my 20s\u2026\u201d BROoOoOoO\u2026\nDoes that logic apply to our marriage too?\nThis was all a few years ago, I stayed because we had bought a house together and I felt that our love should come before my desire to have kids.

I'm sorry you're disappointed your dream of a family is in jeopardy and his promises are broken. \n\nWe, when young, create this illusion of the perfect family with the perfect husband and adorable perfect children. \n\nAlong the way to fulfilling this blissful image of the life we want, we learn through observing, gaining experience, and emotional maturity what really life looks like being a parent, and wife, the true, raw meaning of it. \n\nIt happened to me...\n\nLife handed me a rough hand, but once I got convinced I couldn't be the perfect mom I dreamed of being, due to chronic health, and just the simple fact I realized I don't like children anymore, same with my husband, it was just an illusion we made up in our mind. \n\nWell, we got pregnant. We were not pro-abortion, so we buckled up and did the adult thing, had our kid, and while doing our best as parents nurturing, loving and educating our child. We both have to go to therapy to keep our sanity, because deeply within we are absolutely miserable. \n\nI personally feel asphyxiated, having to hide in my closet to ride the anxiety and panic attacks of a challenging parenting day, and we get pretty much daily challenging parenting days, and no support system, no village to give us a break. Then walk out with a loving smile, and deep breaths to continue pretending all is well, and I'm this happy person who loves being a mom. \n\nIt reaps me inside every day, looking at my child, and feeling so guilty, so wrong, so disgusted with myself because I adore my child, but hate everything about parenting, I walk around feeling gutted, because even though everyone tells me I'm such a great mom, I feel I'm the worse person ever, for not loving my experience in motherhood.\n\nAgain, I adore my kiddo dearly, I'd stop a bullet with my chest for her, and work daily to strengthen and protect our very tight special bond, but there's always this painful emotional battle I wage, I don't wish for anyone.\n\nSo, to my younger sister, before she graduated from College my advice was this one: Before you get into the crude and trapping obligations of adulthood, marriage and parenting, travel the world, grow to know yourself truly. Once you feel the need to settle, get yourself a plant, a puppy, and babysit your niece, then you'll learn what you really want in life. \n\nGreetings.",

You aren't stuck with someone you love, you're stuck with the memories of someone you thought you knew & loved, he conned you, he can lie and be whatever he needs to anyone, there was never any mutual love. The level of disrespect to your entire being to laugh at himself every night knowing he fooled you.. the sheer audacity. My blood boils. He is not who you fell in love with, he was always just saying whatever to make you happy!! He learned you just to con you. Narcissistic scum Get out",

We had many fights about it and he didn\u2019t yield. So i broke up with him although it was super painful. We were apart for 6 months or so. Eventually we got back together but i made it clear that he wants back that means we are on track to marry and have two kids. He agreed. He proposed 2 years later and we now have one child. What i\u2019m trying to say my guy didn\u2019t think i would leave him due to those reasons. But i did and even bought my own apartment for myself when we broke up. He was shocked and it really taught him a lesson for life to take me seriously. Good luck OP. I sympathize with you, he must keep his word if he is a real man. I hope he will come to his senses since it sounds like you have a marriage to fight for.",

At this point I admitted to my wife I already knew about this, as I actually found out accidentally nearly a year ago when somebody anonymously emailed it to me. (I still don't know who or why)\n\nMy wife was stunned and asked me what I had done about it and why I hadn't told her. I told her I hadn't done anything about it because I don't give a shit.\n\nShe was incredulous and asked me what was wrong with me and said that any normal father would be devasted by this and I simply said \"I'm not somebody else, I am me. I don't see any moral problem with sex work\"\n\nThis must have been the wrong thing to say because my wife exploded. She called me a shit father, a lowlife, she admitted she had fallen out of love with me years ago when our kids were tween-aged but she had stayed because she didn't want to leave them without a father, but that this was clearly a mistake because I am such a shit father our kids turned out exactly the same as they would have if I hadn't been there.\n\nI pointed out to her that our daughter having an Only Fans is none of our business and that this kind of reaction is exactly why I didn't tell her about it, because I knew she would hit the roof and try to make life difficult for everybody.\n\nShe now says she is leaving me and that is the just the final confirmation to her that I am the biggest AH to ever walk the planet. I still think I am right but I am sad about my marriage ending and the sheer inconvenience of an impending divorce.\n\nI would like to know how to get my wife to not divorce me.\n\ntl;dr my daughter has an onlyfans, I knew about it, my wife didn't.

Stop looking for advice from Internet strangers. For all you know, they might not be the sort of people you would take advice from irl. What if these Internet strangers are just 16 years old and pretending to know better? \n\nYou should tell your daughter that you know about her of, that the mother is very upset. I think you should also ask her to stop. While one can reduce sexual work logically to something innocuous, in real life sexual workers are lesser quality people. And the quality of friends they make gets them closer to bigger problems like drugs. \n\nIt's going to get ugly for a while. But in the long term they will probably appreciate that the father cared. It might be that the daughter also has some criticism to bring to the father from years before. \n\nI'm speaking as a woman btw.",

Your wife needs to sit with her thoughts as I understand many mothers would be upset, but it seems she\u2019s taking it out on you. If she said she fell out of love with you years ago, maybe she could be saying hurtful things out of anger. I can understand how her seeing you not be angry would be confusing as a father, but you need to frame it as you being supportive of your daughter, period. If something your daughter is doing on her own time is causing your wife to rage and wants to take that out on you, that\u2019s her own problem. Maybe you could\u2019ve handled it more delicately and said you understand her perspective but you can\u2019t fake being angry because that\u2019s not how you feel. She needs to move on and/ or confront her daughter about how she feels about it, it\u2019s not your fault at all. Maybe you should\u2019ve told her you knew, but again you told her the reaction is why. That\u2019s something she needs to discuss with her if she feels strongly but again, you did nothing causing that reaction.",

        "text": "I (24F) have been with my significant other (25M) since I was 19. We\u2019ve been married for over 2 years now and things have not been perfect. I haven\u2019t been feeling happy for awhile and a part of me felt like he stopped trying. My husband goes away for work occasionally for about 2 weeks at a time. I recently was cleaning the house and found his Apple Watch. I seen messages from another women so i decided to read them. I found out my husband was having a full on affair with another women. I messaged the other women and found out she\u2019s works with my husband. Apparently she was unaware he was married. He was going out to bars and buying her drinks and she would stay the night in his hotel room. I confronted my husband and he eventually admitted to cheating but lied and said she was a random women he met at club. I knew he was lying and I texted the other women from my phone. I got messages and photos and when I had enough evidence I showed him everything. My husband broke down crying and was apologizing. I asked him why and he said he wanted to feel wanted. If I\u2019m being honest that made me extremely annoyed. I told him I knew everything and I didn\u2019t want him anymore. He said he wasn\u2019t going anywhere and that he doesn\u2019t want a divorce. He refuses to leave, and says he wants to stay. He keeps saying he wants to be with me and he can\u2019t let me go and I\u2019m  just so over it. I told him I didn\u2019t want him anymore but he\u2019s going on apologizing saying he won\u2019t divorce me. I don\u2019t understand, why cheat and say you\u2019re unhappy but won\u2019t divorce me. I asked if he had feelings for the other women and he said he doesn\u2019t know. He wants to work things out but I\u2019m not happy now and we are far past that. So I want to know why do men who cheat stay or want to stay. He is clearly unhappy and so am I but he refuses to give me a divorce. I\u2019m just looking for advice he\u2019s won\u2019t leave me alone. \nTl;dr I found out he has cheated with over 7 different women and at least 15 times since we been together. I don\u2019t even want him anymore but he won\u2019t divorce me. I don\u2019t get this man or what his problem is. ",

If he sensed you were not happy, then he wasn\u2019t either.  He wouldn\u2019t express that because men know that telling a woman we are not happy, will never make the woman happy or make her want and appreciate us more.  He went looking for someone who made him feel like he was wanted because he has no integrity.  What he is still fighting for is the relationship you had when you were happy.  He needs to see that that time will never come again.  Women are just as likely to cheat and try to stay in the relationship.  Men and women are not inherently better or worse than the other.

And never explore the emotions and have a coherent conversation about the feelings, what they mean, why they mean what they mean, what the proper words are to describe them.

Ignore the advice telling you to bail from your marriage. It\u2019s so easy to give up and hate your spouse when their selfish behavior becomes too much. We have seen so many unnecessary divorces. The grass is not always greener on the other side. Us guys are clueless and often have had lousy father role models or we are all on our own just being plain selfish. We as men have ridiculous fragile ego\u2019s so treading lightly at first is advisable. To me marriage at times is \ud83d\udcaf%-O%. \n\nAfter 40 years my long suffering wife who has had a severe Chronic Illness for 30 of those years still at times has to have a talk with me about my behavior. I listen now because she has wanted out at times during those 40 years and I didn\u2019t want to lose her. She is awesome. Sometimes she is doing in our case \ud83d\udcaf% of the EMOTIONAL load and I am doing Zero. I\u2019m clearly bend towards clueless and value her input. I now LISTEN and change the best I can. She has GRACE towards me or rather loves me unconditionally when I am being selfish. Because of her illness I have to a lot of things (cleaning, cooking, finances, serving her endlessly when her illness gets bad). I never at before marriage I would ever be doing these things. I love her unconditionally. If you can find a good marriage counselor then try that but there are also some ones who will make the problem worse. Educating your fragile ego husband is so possible! Please don\u2019t give up on him. Be creative. \n\nBy the way, we are Christian\u2019s (a lot of Christian\u2019s get divorced too) but our relationship with Jesus Christ has held us together when our relationship was on the precipice many times.

While I was at home with my 3 babies, I cleaned the house and cared for the children. When my husband got home from work, he took over childcare so I could finish doing what needed to be done. I would cook dinner and he would play with the kids. After dinner was done, he always asked if I wanted to clean dinner up or bathe the kids. When he bathed the kids, he didn't leave the bathroom a total wreck. Towels were hung up and all toys were picked up out of the tub\n He brushed hair and teeth with the kids. He did whatever was most helpful to me. He was part of the bedtime routine every single night. He was 100% helping with cleaning and childcare on the weekends. \n\nNo one said a SAHM should sit on her ass all day and do nothing but keep the kids breathing. However, expecting the wife/mom to 100% do all of the cooking, cleaning and childcare is so ridiculous. \n\nIn this case, OP works 30 hours a week. The cleaning should be split. The children are both of their responsibilities. It's not the 1950s. Women are not here to only serve others.",

We have a family calendar where we put events for kids and ourselves, we talk about what we need for the week with childcare and ourselves, date nights, we map out who is making what meal and who will clean what/who will run which errand. Talking about it together helped him realize all the sh*t I was doing and now he helps and I\u2019m way less resentful.

They are fallible and sometimes have their own agendas. \n\nIt took me a long time to find a therapist who was competent, in my insurance network, and that I was able to feel safe with. In fact, I tried so many, I literally lost count, but it was somewhere around 8. Personally, I feel more comfortable with a female therapist. Based on my experience with others, and also because of things from my past, that\u2019s my personal preference.\n\nFinding a therapist that you can open up to safely and honestly is like finding gold. Asking your husband to switch for no other reason than your own insecurities is unreasonable. And if you want him to open up to *you* more, this is definitely not how you go about it.",

Marriage counseling is the setting for him to talk about his problems when he can\u2019t or won\u2019t talk with you about them. A good marriage therapist can open up the conversation between the two of you. Is he opening up during the sessions? Have you discussed your concerns with your therapist and family therapist? \n\nFrom what you\u2019ve shared, you might be jealous of his therapist or their relationship. They have an intellectual intimacy and professional connection that you lack in your relationship with him. That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything wrong with you, only that you have a different background than theirs. According to you, those types of bonds are very important to him. Are you concerned they might turn physical as your husband deals with his sexual problems and discusses them with her? \n\nI\u2019m a 53-year-old male. My wife died last year at 52. We were together for 26 years, married for 23. I have received therapy for many years. My wife started receiving it during the last year or two of her life. But she refused to participate in marriage counseling. She didn\u2019t open up to me about her problems very often. \n\nAfter she died, I found out she had been deceiving me the entire time we were together (long story). She kept so many things from me for so long that I found it almost impossible to grieve because of betrayal layered over grief. It was almost too much to bear at times. If your husband isn\u2019t opening up to you and feels you don\u2019t rise to his level, then he doesn\u2019t value your marriage or appreciate you for the wonderful person you are.

        "text": "So, here's something I have that feels a little complicated.\n\nMy husband experienced sexual trauma from a previous partner. He is specifically triggered by his experience when me (male, if that helps) and him try to have sex. We haven't had sex for a year. I found out he still has a sex drive, has cheated on me, and he claims that his specific trauma is associated with having sex within a committed relationship. On top of this, and before i dound out about thr cheating, i had also cheated. For me, it's because i wasnt feeling satisfied, even though i knew i was with the love of my life. He said it's easier to have sex with someone else still because he doesn't have to worry about what they think, or seeing them again. Therefore, there is no emotional attachment. He fears not being able to please a consistent partner. I respect him intensely, and have watched him break down trying to explain the truama, and id have to agree, it can really inly be fixed in therapy. We have agreed to watch porn on our own times away from each other, just so we can still have a release. He wants to clear things in therapy, but hasn't tried to even go yet, and it bothers him if I bring it up. I'm starting to feel like I'm less desirable, even though he claims to love me with everything. I really feel we do love each other that much too. He's not manipulative or abusive. I just fear we will never have an intimate relationship, and at this point, I don't even think we would know how to flirt on a more intimate level. I want sex, but not more than I want just a stronger bond together. I'm debating on going to therapy myself just so I know how to handle this situation and cope with feeling like I'm with someone who doesn't feel love with me on all levels. I'm okay not having sex often, but it does hurt a little that I know he watches porn or might be exchanging nudes with other guys, but doesn't want to try fixing our issues first. What should I do?\n\nTl;dr: Needing some advice on having a spouse who has sexual trauma, and how to advance if there is no progression.",

cause shes afraid the meds will make her anxiety worse and we might lose the baby.\n\nI have been unemployed but studying i took a course in welding for the last 8 months and just finished up, I despise being unemployed and i want nothing more than to work but my field of study is video game development and we moved 300 km away from every single game studio to be closer to her family during for when she got pregnant, I was working remote at the time but then the policy changed and i was forced to resign... or travel 4 hours to the office, rent a hotel, work the mandatory 2 days and drive home another 4 hours.\n\n  \nok that's the bones of it all.\n\nright now we basically can't not piss each other off, i hate discussing job hunting, if she brings up a position without me asking her to look for any im immediately annoyed, and then she feels sad or annoyed or grumpy or just negative in some way cause shes trying to help... its been a week since i got out of my welding course, i'll be lucky to get an interview in the next month for a walmart position.  \n  \n shes also constantly nagging me to do new chores around the house, i already do everything despite having class for 8 hours a day i still cleaned everything and id the laundry and walked the dogs and made dinner, and watered the grass, and built the things and worked out and i did basically everything everyday and it caused me to resent her cause all she had to do was go to work(she would be in the office for maybe an hour, then be out to see clients, come home for lunch which could be anywhere from an hour to three if it was a slow day, then back to the office , she came home exhausted and then just laid on the couch with some stupid sitcom playing on the tv while she ignored it and watched tiktok on her phone, but shes the one supporting us so I tried not to resent her, or bring it up but things happen, and i would ask her to help out, just like take her laundry upstairs and put it away, or walk the smaller of our 2 dogs ( the one shes had for 8 years, and before we were even dating), or even just make dinner once a week.\n\non the flip side of it all, my wife prior to being pregnant, would constantly worry that im mad at her, that every little thing she did annoyed me, that she couldn't talk to me about anything or it would put me in a bad mood, and she was right for the most part because it was a near constant flip flopping of \"I've had a bad day let's eat out\" \"oh im so fat\" \"i need to eat better\" buys 200 dollars worth of groceries and 45% of it molds because she never looked at it again. so yeah hearing that every single month while we only have 1 income was causing me anxiety and I told her that and i told her i was sorry for being like that but that food ALWAYS goes bad.  \n  \nor she'll order a bunch of random crap off amazon, books for our yet to be conceived child, decorations for the house, new garden supplies for the garden im going to probably end up taking care of, toys for the dogs. and yeah that annoys me too, again 1 income, and shes constantly stressed about the credit cards cause we went on vacation when i was still working and basically maxed it out due to poor decisions and the thought we would have my income to help pay it back, so you know yeah it annoys me that she just feeds back into the thing thats causing her stress which puts her in a bad mood which makes he ask me questions about things that put me in a bad mood so now we're both in bad moods and our credit cards are high (not maxed anymore but high, i got some money from my grandmother passing and put a chunk of it on the card to try and alleviate her stress)\n\nand now that shes pregnant if im in a bad mood, or im grumpy with her for whatever reason im just the worst person in the world, like literally I have a thing about mouths, I don't like looking into them, i think they're gross, and she gets this little bump thing on her tongue and asks me to look at it with her mouth open just gets in my face, and i say no, then she procceds to take like 8 pictures or tries to take 8 pictures of it but fails so i cave and do it for her, now im grumpy, i know i chose to do the thing but like shes not going to do it right and then shes going to be in a state because i didn't help her, and now im im grumpy and it's my fault for choosing to help, so shes grumpy im grumpy, and that just leads into a whole fight about how i am about job hunting and how ive refused help (which i haven't) and that my search is too limited (it's not im just not applying for fast food and gas stations, any other industry if i can do the job or think i can i apply, but again it's been a single week and i actually got approached by a recruiter for a dev job like the tuesday of the first week but can't ride that high gotta keep worrying about everything else i guess)\n\nI can't ask her to help out with anything ESPECIALLY right now, not only is she pregnant shes getting over an illness, same one i had 2 weeks prior and had to push myself through the last week of my course while being extremely exhausted and coughing up a lung, so shes like quadrupal irritable to the point that if I say something under my breath about a mobile game im playing she thinks im annoyed with her about just existing i guess.\n\nI do hate this but when shes not home, when shes at work, Im fine, I do my cleaning and maybe go work on my game and apply for some jobs, walk the dog, and generally im in a good mood, and it'll be fine, even after she gets home, im trying to be in a good mood for her, but then she\\\\ll bring up something i don't want to discuss and she knows i don't want to but we have to cause she needs to talk about it so now im grumpy and my mood is shot.\n\nyeah that's our circle.\n\ntl;dr: my wife and I are in a circle of agitation due to my dislike of certain topics of discussion and dislike of looking in mouths, and her anxiety and stress over little everything and pregnancy.\n\n",

        "text": "I (20F) am getting married in less than two months and for the first time since I\u2019ve met my fianc\u00e9, I noticed something off about his behaviour. All around, he\u2019s everything I could ask for and even more. He\u2019s attentive, understanding, kind, funny, smart, and non-judgmental.\n\nFor context, I always wanted a simple, small-scale wedding and he agreed. But my mother is a dictator who won\u2019t settle for that, and so she decided to take care of the wedding in a financial and planning sense. The irony is, she has a very demanding full time job and has a very hard time committing to important decisions so I am left with planning a lot of the wedding. I\u2019m not in a position to complain because she\u2019ll call me selfish and inconsiderate.  Naturally, I\u2019ve been really stressed and tired from constantly butting heads with my mom. \n\nLast week, I wasn\u2019t feeling well. My fiance was aware of this and we had intended to work on our marriage license application that night. For some time prior, I had brought up that the marriage license application needed to be done. \n\nThere was something very off about this whole conversation. Right off the bat, he came into this more prepared than I as he understood what needed to be done. I expected him to offer to take the initiative and complete the application for us, but instead he insisted a few times that I fill it out. He completed half of the form on his side, took a screenshot of it, and left me to fill it out for the both of us. I was shocked and didn\u2019t know how to react, I thought insisting that he finish the rest would be odd and I didn\u2019t feel like pushing him. So I overlooked it and came up with excuses in my head as to why he hadn\u2019t thought of completing it for the both of us. After all, he was halfway there. \n\nI asked him book the appointment to pick up the license. But he put my phone number and email instead of his. When I mentioned that he could\u2019ve just put his info, he said \u201cYeah but I put yours though\u201d. A few seconds go by and he said \u201cOops I submitted by mistake\u201d. Strange. \n\nI had such a bad migraine that night that I ended up messing up the application, so I had to start it all over again. Again, he told me to redo it. This really bugged me, because I\u2019m planning the bulk of this wedding, and it seemed like he deliberately set up this conversation so that the final application was done by me. I wasn\u2019t expecting him to take the lead because I know what he\u2019s like normally. When it comes to the planning and booking the honeymoon, looking for homes, talking about finances, he takes the lead.\n\nI couldn\u2019t sleep all week. If my parents found they\u2019d be upset, because of the traditional gender roles in our culture. The next morning I softly explained how I felt about this, and he hit me with the \u201cI\u2019m sorry you felt that way\u201d and \u201cI didn\u2019t think much of it\u201d. He wants me to tell him what needs to be done on his end going forward, but why is that necessary? I mean, he should have a rough idea of what\u2019s involved. I really really hate by the prospect of being a nagging wife. And he isn\u2019t usually dismissive, so this leads me to believe there\u2019s a reason why but he just doesn\u2019t want to be honest about it. Does he think it\u2019ll affect his visa application? Is it because I have UK citizenship and he doesn\u2019t? \n\nAt the end of the day, it isn\u2019t really about the application. It took around 45 min. It\u2019s about the lack of consideration, consistency, and initiative that I would expect from a traditional husband. Am I blowing this out of proportion? Is this normal? Am I wrong for expecting him to take initiative for something small yet important, since I\u2019m doing everything else? \n\nTL;DR: I\u2019m planning 70% of our wedding alone due to my controlling and indecisive mom, and my usually supportive fianc\u00e9 oddly left me to finish our marriage license application, even though I was exhausted and unwell. I brought it up, and he brushed it off. Am I wrong for expecting more initiative from him?",

How well can you possibly know each other, or is this an arranged marriage? \n\nSince your mother has a career, I'm thinking that you don't live somewhere where women are completely oppressed, so why get married now? Why not give yourselves time to get to get to know each other better and finish your education so that you can have a career like your mother? You do not want to put yourself in a situation where you're completely financially dependent on a man. Those situations often lead to physical, emotional, and financial abuse.\n\nYour fiance sounds very lazy, immature, and selfish, and marriage isn't going to make that any better. Put the wedding on hold, finish your education, and work for a few years before thinking about marriage. I think you're here asking these questions because you know this guy isn't the one. Listen to your instincts.\n\nTake care, sweetie.",

I think it's better to live together first , as you REALLY get to know someone based on willingness to do chores, cleanliness, etc., but I respect that your personal values don't allow for that. \n\nI would definitely discuss things like chores (and finances and children) before getting married, since those are the things married people tend to fight most about.\n\nI don't remember our marriage license application taking 45 minutes to complete, but I'm American, and I'm thinking you might not be? Also, I got married 25 years ago, so things have probably changed.\n\nIf this is out of the ordinary for him, could your fiance just be lazy about tedious things like filling out forms? None of us enjoy it, of course, but if he's going to be lazy and half-ass it, perhaps you can agree to do stuff like that if he agrees to do a specific chore that you hate.\n\nRegarding wedding planning, it's not completely out of the ordinary that he's not particularly interested in that stuff. I don't know many guys who are, to be honest. My husband looked at venues with my mom and I (though he honestly didn't care where we got married - he wanted me to be happy) and did the food/cake tastings.  He also went with my dad and I to help him pick out tuxedos for himself, the groomsmen and ushers (my dad worked in the fashion industry and was really knowledgeable/talented in that arena). I only went to wrangle my father because he could be a LOT to deal with:)\n\nOne thing I have noticed with my husband is that if I need him to help with a specific thing, I need to just come out and ask him to do it since he's completely incapable of reading my mind.

The only time he's happy is when I pretend nothing happened. I cook for him I clean but he never shows up for me. I need so much for him to be genuine and reassuring. I want so much for him to care and treat me like he loves me. Meaning, he actually feels bad when he sees me upset. I get the opposite. He gets defensive and angry. Whenever I try to talk about issues he leaves. Either says he has to go (on the phone) or literally walks out. I am at my end. I'm done with the threats, fighting, tit for tat, I'm just over everything. I don't know what to do. He says he loves me but his actions scream he's done.

        "text": "Well, it actually began before the birth of our baby. He just got really distant, began prioritizing work more than anything, we stopped being intimate even though I still wanted to, even in late pregnancy. I started having constant nightmares about him cheating on me. I've always had a really good intuition but I chalked it up to hormones and figured after birth and healing time, things would go back to normal and those suspicions would vanish. Well, they didn't. In fact, they only have gotten worse. At some point I was looking through his phone (during a rare moment when he forgot to bring it into a store with him), and discovered screenshots of basically nude women from social media. I talked to him about it and he decided he would delete social media to make me feel better (this idea was unprompted by me, though I have mentioned many many times that he's spending way too much time on social media). He swore that it was there only because he gets stuff like that advertised to him on sm and one of his friends loves stuff like that so he was sending those screenshots to him. I told him there are so many reasons that doesn't make it better, and he told me he agreed. So I thought the problem was solved. I took some time to heal and move on from it. However, there's still something up. I still feel like something is going on. He is still always on his phone, even though I've seen that the apps are gone. He still works so many hours and says it's because he's worried about money. I've told him time and time again that we are fine financially (I do our finances), but he still says he's worried. When he is home, he's on his phone, playing a videogame, or watching YouTube. Then he sleeps. He oversleeps a lot, which I know is health-related and is currently being helped. We still aren't intimate often, but he doesn't give me any attention otherwise. I'm wondering if he's skewing his hours at work (he's a manager, he has access to everything) and spending time with someone else. Or maybe it's simply stress (though that has been an issue in the past and i never felt this way about it)? Or perhaps he's still looking at pornographic content (he always spends a suspicious amount of time in the bathroom, especially at home). Maybe he just isn't attracted to me anymore (we were both overweight when we got together, but I began losing weight before getting pregnant, and have kept that up after giving birth. He has talked about losing weight but has never put any real effort into it. Maybe he doesn't like that I'm doing it?) Either way, I know for a fact that something is going on but I have no evidence that he's cheating. What do I do?\n\nTl;dr: I know something is up with my husband- he's doing something behind my back, but I have no evidence. My intuition has never been wrong though. What should I do?",

I went thru rehab and a 2yr program to fix my issues. Ive been successful at maintaining and drink 6 drinks a week. \n\nSpouse alcohol abuse only stopped during pregnancy. She went to 6months of my therapy/counseling, stopped going as she was told she had a problem too and needed her own professional help to overcome trauma based ptsd from childhood, previous relationship, possible bi-polar disorder. Any request for her to get help, it ends in an argument amd she leaves on her disappearing act.\n\nSpouse has gone out drinking, doesnt communicate,  doesnt come home for 4-6 days. When she returns home, she acts as if nothing is wrong. This has happens at least once a month... for the past 5yrs.There has been issues with infidelity(her) in our relationship. We've worked thru this, but I still hold some resentment. I should also add, that when she chooses to drink at home, she passes out while caring for our young daughter. Ive caught her doing this several times.\n\nWhen the above happens, im left to work FT and find some way to care for our daughter. I get very angry and scream/yell at her. Nothing physical. Ive repeatedly asked her to stop and get back to seeking professional help. She either refuses or tells me she will, but never follows thru.\n\nIve threatened to leave several times. Ive installed cameras in the home to protect my daughter, im the event something would happen. Wife thinks the cameras are a violation of her personal privacy. Ive explained why they are there.\n\nLast week, the disappearing act happened again. Part of me wants to end this, the other part of me wants to sit it out, hope she comes back amd we can fix tbis once and for all.\n\nI need some non-biased advice.\n\nTl;dr my wife has an alcohol abuse issue, disappears at least once a month for 6days with no comminicstion, over 5yrs of relatio ship.

        "text": "we have been together for almost 10 years .married since October  for the most part he is to himself and doesnt really appears to care about certain things as much as I do. With that being said anytime I talk about my issues ect he claims im just bitching and no other woman would bitch nearly as much ect. So im wondering am I the only one that just talks/ bitches? Also our relationship is very good except for times like these... when we fight we really fight so im also wondering what do your fights look like sometimes do they get out hand? What draws the line of a massive fight a dv you know do you ever have massive fights ? Most of our fights are started because I dont believe he cares and he claims he does. He keeps telling me its am age thing when your older its just different and hes more mature that way. I think I just want to be loved a little more than he shows I dont know? Please share your marriage experiences!\n\nTl;dr what is your first year of marriage experiences? Are we just ironing our shit out or what?",

Remember, it's 2 becoming 1, and that being said, it's 2 different upbringings that have to learn to balance each other now and work together as a team. Most fights are surface level based on misunderstanding of each other and communication through asking questions and listening to understand each other vs thinking the other person should just know and be a mind reader and understand the problem",

But Relationship? It's definitely not so easy. That's the person you said you wanted for life! That's until death. Not just a few years until retirement.....\nIt seems to be a common theme..... women change careers, usually to a higher power job or a more demanding role, and suddenly, they no longer have the time or energy to be in a relationship or even a parent. It consumes them and all their energy. Any semblance of a work-life balance fails to exist, and all of their focus is on nothing but work, I have seen it happen several times to family and friends, and but only one time (out of 8 occasions) to the man.... and that situation had other factors in it too.\nNow this comment may upset some but it's what I have observed and what has been observed in society too in may studies, women find it extremely difficult to have a family (relationship)and a demanding career at the same time. Most tend to sacrifice the family first because they worry if they change jobs, they will be seen as a failure and as giving up something too difficult, something they were not strong enough to handle. In reality, that simply is not how others see it. Others see it as failure to hold down a good relationship. And then viewed as \"complicated\" or \"damaged goods\" and \"too much drama\" then usually they remain single.....\n\nAnd they are almost never willing to accept that the career change is the reason for the problems. I would suggest evaluating the situation. There is always the possibility of changing career again..... but to one that gives a better work, life balance. Or throttling back a bit and giving a bit less focus on work and more on personal life.\nSomething to think about.......\n\nSorry if that hits hard, but I hope it makes sense and can make the changes needed to save the situation.",

        "text": "\n\nHi all,\n\nI\u2019m reaching out because I\u2019m emotionally exhausted and feel like I\u2019m battling myself in this relationship. My husband (we\u2019re both 30) has been emotionally abusive in ways that I didn\u2019t fully recognize at first but are now impossible to ignore.\n\nHe constantly gaslights me\u2014denies things he\u2019s said or done, twists conversations, and makes me question my memory or perception. Whenever I try to have a real conversation, he either shuts down completely (stonewalling) or flips the narrative to make me feel like I\u2019m being unreasonable or overly sensitive.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more confusing is that he\u2019s able to  existed himself in an aggressive and insulting way via text messages\u2014but when we talk in person, he avoids accountability and can\u2019t handle any emotional discomfort. It feels like he\u2019s only \u201cemotionally available\u201d when he has the safety of a screen to hide behind. In real life, he seems entitled, dismissive, and emotionally cold.\n\nI\u2019m at the point where I don\u2019t think it's worth it anymore. I don\u2019t feel like a partner\u2014I feel like I\u2019m being manipulated, drained, and dismissed.\n\nI\u2019m posting here to ask:\n\nHas anyone else experienced this pattern?\n\nHow did you deal with the mixed signals (aggressive via text, cold-in-person)?\n\nWhat helped you gain clarity or take the next step\u2014whether that meant staying and working on things or leaving?\n\n\nThanks for reading. I feel really alone right now, and any insights or shared stories would mean a lot.\n\nTL;DR:\nMy husband (30M) emotionally abuses and gaslights me (30F). He\u2019s aggressive and insulting over text but cold and avoidant in person. I feel manipulated, emotionally drained, and unsure if this relationship is worth staying in. Looking for others who\u2019ve experienced this and how they found clarity or made a decision.\n\n\n",

It\u2019s a huge part of why I\u2019ve hesitated, even though deep down I know something isn\u2019t right.\n\nIf you (or anyone reading this) has been in a similar situation, especially with kids involved, I\u2019d really appreciate hearing what helped you recognize it was time to walk away. Was there a specific moment, or was it more of a slow realization? What made it finally click for you?\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand what clarity feels like in situations like this.

I love my wife dearly and I put up with these setbacks. We are both 34. I've kept quiet because I see in marriages we make compromises. But is there anything I can do. She views sex and intimacy as the least important in marriage. TL;Dr wife doesn't open up to any sex positions or vaginal sex.

        "title": "Wife kicked me out for not sticking to agreement",
        "post-author": "JustAnothaDad",
        "text": "So my wife 34(F) kicked me out of the house 35(M) because I fell asleep with my 1.5 year old son in our bedroom. For more context, we did agree that I would give him to her after he fell asleep but I also fell asleep with him. This isn\u2019t the first time this has happened and my wife says that she gets very high anxiety about not knowing where he is. When I was with my younger child, she was with my toddler putting him down to sleep. After I texted her that my youngest fell asleep, I fell asleep and 15-20 min later she texted me that my oldest fell asleep and then she was calling for me and I didn\u2019t respond. She checked the cameras and saw that I fell asleep in our bedroom. \n\nThe last time this happened she was upset that I fell asleep in a room with no camera so she could see where we were. She said that I need to be within view at all times so she doesn\u2019t have to worry about where our youngest is or if anything happened. I told her my bad and okay I\u2019ll do that. I\u2019ll not fall asleep with them ever and give em to you\n\nFast forward to today\u2019s issue, it happened again but this time I told her where I was gonna be and she got mad to the point where she kicked me out. Am I crazy to think that this is very much an overreaction? Our marriage has been very rough the past years since having kids and she said that if I mess up again then that\u2019s it and I said okay. But this time I was actually in view for her to know where I was at. I never expected that we would be where we are at after 14 years together.\n\nEDIT TO ADD EVEN MORE CONTEXT:\n\nTo give more context about what\u2019s going on. I have never once cheated or had an affair or talked to another woman for as long as we have been together; for those who are assuming. We have been together for 14 years and on my end of things, I have never been great at communication. We\u2019ve always had our fair share of arguments and nothing really surfaced until we had kids. My wife has, although not clinically diagnosed, has OCD and is very much has a Type A personality. I have been recently diagnosed with ADHD. My wife has an issue with me listening, communicating, and not following through with things that I say that I will do. I do often leave stuff around weeks on end before picking them up or getting to them. For my wife, she can be very critical of things that I do as they are not the right way or not as we agreed. Since having kids though, she has expressed that she is taking too much of a mental load. Along with  breastfeeding my, she works full time, does the laundry, handles the bills (she feels like in bad at managing money so she takes on the financials), makes the appointments for kids, plans birthdays, and more. If we compare which I\u2019m sure people want to, I make breakfast/lunch/and dinner, change their diapers, do the dishes, clean the house (vacuuming, dusting, mopping, clean toilets and showers), bathe both boys, dress em, brush their teeth, and some other things I\u2019m probably missing. My wife feels like I\u2019m not doing enough and the things I do don\u2019t matter as to what she does. I\u2019ve never once yelled or cursed or called her names. Vice versa, I have been attacked verbally (called the worst names) and even physically (though it hasn\u2019t happened in a while; she pushed me multiple times when I fell asleep with our 2nd child when he was like 2 months. Also pulled/grabbed my hair to make a point). Even with all she has done, she still has supported me through school, my hobbies, through rough times. The source of this all comes from me not being able to listen and to not be able to commit to doing things that we agreed to. I left the house as in I went to go sleep in the car. She\u2019s also upset that I left her to go to a bachelor party for 4-5 days for my best friend that I haven\u2019t seen for 10+ years. I\u2019m one of his groomsmen. She was with the boys at her parents house and had the help of her dad which I thought would be fine. She\u2019s guilt tripping me for about of things\n\n\nTL;DR - Wife kicked me out because I didn\u2019t follow the agreement to give her our youngest after he fell asleep with me and I ended up falling asleep with him",

Also, no matter what there are NO excuses for physical violence on her end of any kind. \nI will say that as just one part of the equation, where you yourself mentioned issues doing things \u201ccorrectly\u201d/etc, it is possible that you have done more wrong than you think. My husband and I had a similar dynamic at one point, because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t do things good enough like the way I wanted them\u201d I stopped trusting him to do them and I ended up having to take on the entire mental load of our daily lives. And he got to relax, and it really screwed us up until someone mentioned the concept of weaponized incompetence to me. Maybe look it up and see if any of it could apply to your situation? No matter who is in the wrong, and it likely is a little bit of you both, if your wife doesn\u2019t trust you to do xyz correctly and safely (whether you have given her a reason to or not), then she will always end up taking on more than she should and there will always be conflict. You two really should look into some kind of counseling or therapy, because sometimes it is the only thing that can help both parties see what\u2019s really wrong.",

Since ADHD often involves forgetting things, she likely is truly worried you'll inadvertently hurt the children. She's desperately trying to control everything, and it just isn't possible, but she doesn't realize that yet.\n\nPlease get both of you into individual and couples' therapy. You need coping skills to compensate for ADHD, and she needs coping skills that don't involve being abusive. She absolutely needs to get this under control before she reacts the same way to the children. Both of you need couples' therapy to try to put this marriage back on track. If it doesn't work, at least you tried your best.\n\nBest wishes for success ~",

He refuses to because he says therapy isn\u2019t going to do anything. I\u2019ve been patient and hoped that he would warm up to the idea of it, but he hasn\u2019t. He says that he hasn\u2019t been able to be a good husband bc of his mental health so my response to that is so are you going to continue to live this way? At some point you have to seek help or try and pull yourself out of this dark place. I feel horrible for saying that bc I feel it sounds insensitive, but idk what else to do/think/say. \n\nI fear I\u2019ll wake up and it\u2019ll be 20 years and we\u2019ll still be in this position. & I don\u2019t want that but I can\u2019t fathom the thought of leaving him.",

Of course it does, but the people who then extend out to being totally confident he is manipulative are being a bit extreme given they just met you today.\n\nYou seem to have a decent handle on it....his mental health prevented him from doing the right things, yet he refused to get the help he needed which is very frustrating. If you have any desire to salvage the marriage, now that he IS trying, this is when you would go to couple's therapy and lay it all out. You'll find out if he really is committed and doing it for you or doing it to protect himself.\n\nHe should be able to hear you say out loud in front of a therapist that while you see him trying, it isn't moving the needle. Then, the therapist (if you both have enough energy left to put forth effort simultaneously) can help you heal.\n\nOne key point I've learned over my 11 years with my wife is that simultaneous effort is required for true healing. If it goes back and forth, it creates the effect of each person feeling like the other is ungrateful.\n\nTL:DR - If you have a desire to try and salvage things one more time, you should go to the couple's therapy and put in one more burst of joint effort. If it fails, you know you gave one more push. Alternatively, if you're just done, that's okay too.",

For the rest of you, I hope you don't find yourself in my shoes, because you're screwed if you do! Now the update, we had a very long conversation this weekend. Saturday 6 we put the kids to bed, I told her I needed to say some things and I'd like here to listen, and if she had a response I was all ears, if not, ok. I laid out for her exactly how I've felt recently, and I didn't hold anything back. If this was our last relationship talk, I wanted it all out. I explained to her that her behavior regarding my feelings was crushing after 10 years of marriage, 3 kids, and 2 home purchases, and it wasn't something I felt I could handle anymore. I told her plainly that if we don't start immediately making moves towards repairing what's been broken, that we were simply going to divide assets and divorce because living this way is not realistic long-term, and I believe we both deserve to be happy, even if that means it's not together. When I said divorce, she went pale. She admitted that she's been purposely avoiding the hard subjects I've been asking to talk about because she didn't know how to handle them. She agreed that it wasn't a healthy way to deal with this, and she knows that, but she wasn't sure what to do, so she avoided it. We both talked about our childhoods and how we feel the way we were raised has affected our marriage (her from a broken home and a mom who was harsh and generally cruel to her dad, and myself from the shit show I grew up in.) We got together at 18 and married at 20, so neither of us had any reliable examples of what a healthy marriage should look like, then had our first kid at 22, so I think we jumped into the deep end before we had figured out how to even tread the water. We sat and talked for 6.5 hours Saturday night into Sunday morning, and it was a desperately need talk. I'm ashamed to admit that I never stopped to truly consider that she might be feeling lost the same way I do and that she was trying to find the same light I am. We definitely have a long way to go before we're out of the water, but I think we've at least found the direction to head. This morning, she called and set up the appointment for us to see a couples therapist. It felt really good to see her taking the initiative and to see her showing a real attempt at reaching the same goal I am. I'll update again when I have more to share. Truly thank you to everyone who had helpful advice to offer! And for those who think I'm a loser or weak, or whatever else, I appreciate that, too! No sarcasm, I really do enjoy criticism. Without it, you can't improve!!\n\n\nHello, I (m30) am beginning to think my marriage has run its course. Preface, we're both 30, 3 kids together, and have been married for 10, together for 12.\nThe biggest fuel to this is we have no communication, zero. She never wants to talk about anything, even when I directly bring up an issue or a subject I'd like to work on, she sits there silently until I feel like I'm talking to a wall and give up. When I brought this up, I was told she needed time to process everything and would get back to me. Annoying, but what can you do? So I said ok, except she never got back to me. In fact, she never gets back to me. It's caused the majority of our talks to become fights, so now it seems like all we ever do is fight. Our sex life is all but dead, and what little there is doesn't even feel hot anymore, it just feels stale and transactional, to the point that I don't even pursue it anymore. We don't lay together afterwards, and the kissing is so stiff and cold. She swears up and down she loves me and that she's happy, but I don't feel love in our home anymore. I hate the thought of divorce, especially because of the kids, but I feel unhappy and depressed in my married life. I set my own hours and make my own schedule at work, and recently I've been taking advantage of that to go into work earlier than necessary just to avoid the morning fight, and working til really late at night so she's asleep when I get home. It breaks my heart to admit, but I have a better day when I don't spend time with her at all. I'm strongly considering divorce, but admittedly I'm scared. What do I do?\nTo make a long story short\ntl;dr : I feel like my marriage has died and I need to do something about it before it gets toxic, but I don't know what..\n",

Good for you stirring the pot, I'm amused.     \nBut I'm going to speak to anyone being serious here...there's nothing to gain by cheating, you're not \"punishing bad behavior\" you would be engaging in it. It sounds like the wife (as well as OP) has had family/relationship issues and is probably not doing anything on purpose, but lacks some skills or motivation. So there's no evidence she is doing something anyone needs to \"punish\". It's normal to avoid unpleasant things you aren't good at. Even so, it's not your responsibility to punish your partner. And if you become a cheater, you risk impacting your kids, and you lose any credibility or high ground to ask for compromise. I would be less motivated to try to make changes because my cheating partner wants me to or they will cheat on me some more.\nSo just leave if you're thinking of becoming a cheater over her poor skills.\nOr OP, you can stay and help her- without judgement or resentment- because if she can't communicate, that's something to be empathetic about. It must suck to have someone think they are keeping their dissatisfaction a secret (but likely to reach this point-OP is likely expressing disapproval over things) - and you can't onboard or discuss it.",

I can be methodical and vulnerable. People who are vulnerable are easy to take advantage of. What makes you think that passion or vulnerability would fix a relationship that he feels is controlling? It would likely have the opposite outcome. Some people need a reality check and to understand how far they've pushed their partner, their child, their friends and so on. Also asking someone you're fighting with not to contact you at work is a common mediation tactic. It keeps both parties from overwhelming each other in an already stressful place (work).\n\nAt 30 I've learned and benefited most from having a realistic plan and goal. This guy wanted to fix his marriage or be done with it. He picked a way to go about it and he got one of the outcomes he was looking for. Be vulnerable when it's appropriate, be passionate when it's appropriate, but being pragmatic and methodical should be people's default. Passion and vulnerability are whims they should be done when the moment inspires or needs it.",

OP\u2019s post reads just as easily like he\u2019s a constant nag and she\u2019s done listening to all his constant complaining about his problems with her and has been browbeaten into ignoring them and making that dynamic the only way to tolerate the status quo. OP doesn\u2019t indicate any real attempt to do anything much about anything except \u201ctalk\u201d (about how he is dissatisfied with his wife). Chances are good that she\u2019s just as dissatisfied but is sticking it out \u201cfor the kids\u201d as so many people do. Since OP didn\u2019t mention any past attempt at or future desire to seek out third-party counseling and intervention, that\u2019s the main thing I would suggest before blowing everything up. \n\nOP laments \u201czero communication,\u201d but OP seems to only consider \u201ccomplaining about the relationship\u201d to be \u201ccommunication.\u201dI\u2019ve been in relationships like that in the past, and they\u2019re exhausting. But communication issues can be fixed, especially if there\u2019s a bigger motive to do so. Like to fix a marriage and keep a young family together. If unmarried and childless and it\u2019s just some annoying boyfriend or girlfriend constantly in your ear about how this or that isn\u2019t good enough\u2014or how the relationship (and you specifically) needs to be improved (by you specifically)\u2014people can just pack up and walk pretty easily. Nobody wants to hear constant whining about how much they suck and how inadequate they are. That gets old in a hurry. \n\nFrankly, OP sounds to me like a nag. Nags don\u2019t cultivate lively bedrooms, and they don\u2019t encourage reasoned discussion. They complain, the other party gets defensive, fights ensue, bad feelings translate to nonexistent or bad or dismissive sex, and that turns into bitterness and then indifference. \n\nTherapy can help. Couples therapy might work. Individual therapy is going to be critical for OP regardless. The next gal isn\u2019t going to want to \u201ccommunicate\u201d this way, either.",

Find ways to connect - stop deliberately avoiding her! Try and start having regular date nights once a month and rekindle some of the old spark. \n\nHaving kids is extremely hard on a woman - we lose a lot of our own identity when we become a mum - there is little time left to put into ourselves and we can become fixated on the mundane and the marriage suffers. Protecting the marriage and keeping it fun and exciting should be paramount as your happiness or unhappiness will rub off on those kids.",

By 8p when the kids go to bed, I'm beat. But I don't just stop, I make sure to make time for her and I after, because to me, making sure she feels loved is just as important as making the kids feel loved.

Every camping trip, every evening dinner, every holiday was just sad. They split when I was 18 while I was gone to basic, and the difference between them together at my high school graduation, to them apart at my boot camp grad was like meeting people I had never known before.

Turns out that (as a very ingrained part of his personality, probably formed in childhood)  he cannot bear confrontation. I had a hard time relating to that, because I've always been a \"lay my cards on the table\" kind of person. But for me to even say \"I need to talk to you about something\" struck such terror in his heart that defenses would immediately go up and he would outwardly seem to go along with me, but over the years, resentment grew and he struck back at me in hidden ways. (Forming inappropriate emotional bonds with other women, mainly--women who always treated him gently and took his side on every issue bc all they ever heard was his side of the story, and how mean I was to him, and anyway nothing he did affected their lives so they could afford to be his cheerleaders.) Anyway, not to delve too much into my personal situation, my point is that I wonder if your wife is like that--just simply unable to manage even the slightest confrontation. My husband is just never ready to go toe-to-toe with me about anything, big or small. I thought I was just miraculously winning every argument for 28 years, turns out he was forfeiting and hating me for it. Anyway, we've learned that emailing is a way for us to have the serious conversations. Sometimes I can hardly wait for him to leave for work so I can email him what's on my mind. We find that instead of flying off the handle, we are more thoughtful about what we say and how we say it. We are less likely to \"pop off\" and give a hurtful response. Maybe your wife would do better at writing her communications to you.\n\nTL;DR - Maybe wife is overwhelmed by confrontational conversations--try having them in writing.",

What does happen is one or both people stop showing up. Stop fighting for it. Stop putting in the work. And instead of owning that, they slap a poetic little label on it, \u201cthe marriage has died\u201d, so they can justify walking away without guilt.\n\nYou\u2019ve got three kids. That means walking away is not just about you. You don\u2019t get to chase your personal peace at the cost of blowing up their world without first exhausting every option to fix it. And no, avoiding your wife by leaving early and coming home late isn\u2019t trying. It\u2019s hiding. That\u2019s emotional cowardice, not problem-solving. Now let\u2019s talk about your wife. You say she doesn\u2019t talk. She shuts down. Okay. That\u2019s frustrating. But did you two ever learn how to communicate? Did you ever get help? Go to counseling? Work with a therapist? Or are you just blaming her silence for your growing disinterest while quietly checking out?\n\nin my experience, men who start talking like this usually already have someone else in mind. Maybe not physically, but mentally, you\u2019ve already left. You\u2019re fantasizing about freedom. But you\u2019re not thinking long-term. You\u2019re not thinking about what it\u2019s going to do to your kids when Dad moves out because \u201cMom wouldn\u2019t talk.\u201d You\u2019re not thinking about how that next relationship will hit the same wall when you bring the same avoidance and resentment into it.\n\nThis is emotional burnout mixed with avoidant behavior. You want relief, not necessarily a divorce. That numbness you're describing? That\u2019s not proof it\u2019s over. That\u2019s proof you're emotionally disconnected and probably haven\u2019t tried in a long time. So either step up or step out but don\u2019t do it half-assed and call it fate.\n\nGet help. Go to counseling. Fight for your family. You don\u2019t get to check out and call it noble just because you\u2019re scared. You made a vow. Start acting like it still means something.",

He chose to have an affair, and excused it by saying he fell out of love, but never had a conversation with me about it. In my case, im glad he did that so I could get out sooner since I was with someone who would cheat, but the other side of me felt so blindsided thinking why didn't he tell me he was seriously unhappy? Why didnt he just talk to me? You married her for a reason. Try marriage counseling first, and have a serious conversation with her. If she needs time to process, say we'll pick this back in 1 hour so you're forced to talk again. Not saying it will work out, but at least give her a chance to understand where youre at.",

Therefore we may conclude you aren\u2019t helping with the am dress, breakfast, lunches, school run, pickup, homework, projects, practice/lessons/activities.  Housework, groceries, mealprep?  Doc, dentist, eye doc, school stuff?  Planning and packing for vacations?  Vehicle maintenance?  Your work schedule does not allow you to participate in these\u2014you said it yourself. \n\n     You sound completely detached from your family and what it takes to be a parent.  When does she sleep?  If you do the divorce attorney vs counseling card ultimatum and you already know you don\u2019t have time for counseling that means you get the kids half the time.  Every other week and weekend.  Will your work schedule allow that?  If she is a married single mother already, what will change for her if you divorce?  \n\n    When I left my spouse and he had to have our son at first 8-5 and gradually overnights I slept.  I slept so much.  I didn\u2019t realize how tired I was.  If he had just helped me instead of yell at me when I asked for help it would have made so much difference.  \n\n   She is going to give these kids a happy childhood.  They are going to have it.  They are going to go to school knowing they are loved and ready to have a great day.  \u201cMorning fights?\u201d  Really?  While she is getting ready for work and the kids are getting ready for school, that is when you want to talk about your needs not being met and get upset?  Really?  She is not sending them off to school crying and upset.  \n\n    She is going to make a happy home and childhood for her kids.  You are welcome to join.  You will not interfere.  Her flat expression when you bring things up makes me think that when she asked you to help in the past you interfered or criticised, making things harder for her.\n\n    This is a busy and tiring time in your life.  It\u2019s go go go but the kids are still smaller.  Your wife sitting there silently staring into space while you talk sounds like she is at her max.  If you go to counseling she will repeat what she has already said to you multiple times before.  \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you\u201d on your unreasonable if not impossible expectation of just 1 more thing there is no way she has time or energy for.  She knows this.  She is also wondering why you are coming up with one more thing SHE has to do.  \n\n   If she communicates she knows it makes it worse (you mention \u201cmorning fights\u201d, plural) but if she lets you air out your grievances while the kids watch Frozen then at least she sits down for awhile while she dissociates, it buys her some time while you leave her alone until the next \u201ctalk\u201d, and there isn\u2019t a fight the kids see or hear.  She already sees the \u201cfights\u201d don\u2019t fix or resolve things, and she doesn\u2019t want them going off to school upset.  She is not going to fight anymore.  Don\u2019t tell her what she needs to change.  Give her time to sleep.  If you are already leaving everything to her go see a counselor and work on yourself.  \n\nI also recall an interview where an escort said if these guys would spend this money on a cleaning service, doordash, and a baby sitter or part time nanny they would be getting plenty of sex at home.",

Trust me, every stagnant, stale, challenging or rough patch through the ups and downs of marriage will make your marriage stronger and your love deeper if you work hard to get through it. Don't let a down period be the end... persevere! Seek a good counselor to help you form good communication skills. Start dating again. Really focus on each other and building back up your relationship. It is worth it! Divorce is NOT better, the grass is NOT greener - you'll only be trading these problems for much worse problems. The best thing you can do is everything you can to get through this and reconnect to your wife and marriage. Good luck!",

If either of you has checked out, only one thing to do. If she WANTS this relationship to continue, I would consider marriage counseling. Your children cannot be an anchor in your relationship unless you are willing to commit a miserable life, which is unhealthy for them anyways. \"I am willing to try\" is not \"want\". Without genuine want, there will be no real effort or change. Sorry you're going through this. No promises you will find yourself happier after divorce but I can tell you, as long as you love and prioritize your children above all else, you can minimize the pain it will cause them.",

If you are meeting her needs and she refuses to meet yours, you don't have a wife/partner. You have a live-in roommate. Don't try holding it together for the kids. Kids are very perceptive and can tell when something is very wrong with mommy and daddy. Growing up in a dysfunctional household can seriously mess those kids up. They will grow up thinking that that kind of messed up is normal for a healthy relationship. \n\nFor future relationships, you need to lay out your boundaries and expectations from the start and make sure your future partner understands that those are grounds that will cause you to leave. You also can't be afraid to enforce those boundaries/expectations regardless of your feelings. \n\nJust as an example, I love my wife, but she knows I don't do dead bedroom unless there's a medical issue or she has a monthly visitor. I told her if it comes to a point where I feel like I have to cheat to get my needs met, that I'd rather just part ways instead of actually cheating.",

I knew something was up. You were at that stage mostly because of me. I was not a good communicator I was depressed. Hated my job. Got to be at home. Stay at home dad 2022. Which we agreed on I mean, she made all the money it would cost more to have a babysitter May 2024 is when I picked up her phone now we will probably be. We will be divorced in a week. We are selling our house. We have a seven-year-old son   Discovered the first day she had deleted text messages from a coworker. I thought it was just an emotional thing. She\u2019s been working with him forever, and I wasn\u2019t there to communicate with. I was always quiet, but I kept digging. She still sticks to the story she only deleted one text About a month ago. I realize she was a narcissist. I watched the videos and she fitted to the T. 2000s of dollars transferred back-and-forth between them, she took care of all the bills. I knew nothing she would call him every day soon as she left the house about a week ago I piece together. She was doing swinging things with him checking her phone records as little I had these random calls Match those up to people some hot mom with three kids is not delivering her Uber  she was using sex app stating apps backed up thousands of dollars and bills using those pretty sure she had sex with half of my town and half of his town. I just realized this all the other day my loyal wife of 25 years and I was supposed to be the only one she ever had sex with   I knew something was up from day one nobody believe me not my family nobody my whole family. I disowned everybody took her side. Apparently her family knew about this much longer before I did 25 years. She thinks I don\u2019t know her when she\u2019s lying to me I never had to test her before Her father abandoned her mother and her sister to start a life with another woman and she actually has the wedding for their daughter this weekend.  I have no idea you never know we tried counseling. She just lied. Just be honest and go with your gut and good luck. It\u2019s tough when you have kids. That\u2019s the only thing I hate I care about how this is gonna affect my son in a couple weeks when we tell him we\u2019re moving out of our house and mommy and dad are gonna live separately and you\u2019re gonna be starting a new school.   And I could start a new life at 43. No idea what I\u2019m doing where I\u2019m going. I\u2019m alone just be honest with her and hope she\u2019s honest with you. Good luck my friend a lot of good advice here OP I\u2019d also give her permission to have an open relationship just don\u2019t lie to me. I felt so guilty for what I had done.   I am the biggest fool. Cheers.",

So what we did was we listened to a book called Non-violent communication which really teaches you a lot of how to communicate in a healthy way. It also shows how the way we phrase things while confronting a person which makes a big difference. It also teaches you how to see the other person\u2019s perspective in a way that might really benefit you. For example, if your wife is always thinking \u201che doesn\u2019t care about my emotions and is detaching from me\u201d and you\u2019re thinking \u201cshe\u2019s pulling away and won\u2019t talk to me\u201d you both have a narrative in your head about the other which pushes you away even more. This book helps mend those thoughts and feelings and helps you channel your emotions in a positive, productive way. \n\nAlso, my boyfriend and I have \u201crelationship meetings\u201d every other day. Which is just a set time for us to sit down and talk. Because we know when a meeting is coming up we don\u2019t have to worry about issues randomly being sprung which helps both of us. We sit down and say a few things we want to work on or the other to work on, we say this in a way that assures the other that they are loved and appreciate, we never try to say it in a confrontational way that would make the other feel ashamed. Because the meetings are so frequent after the first week of meetings it\u2019s mostly just us checking in and talking about smaller issues, with the occasional larger issues. \n\nAll of this may sound small but it made a big difference, it taught us how to stop always pointing the finger at the other and truly make us reflect in s healthy way, which truly sounds like something you need. If you are going to work as early/late as possible and you\u2019re basically checked out of your relationship you are part of the issue as much as she is. You\u2019re basically saying you stopped trying and it\u2019s only hurting her, your kids and yourself so is this the best solution or the easiest one? It\u2019s not just her fault, it\u2019s not just your perspective, you need to want to see hers. I bet if she wrote a Reddit post about her perspective on your relationship it would sound a lot different from yours, truly think about that. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going through a lot too, neither of you are handling it well but do not just blame her, blame yourself too.",

Feeling unheard and unseen is a terrible thing. If your wife is unwilling to go to counseling (which I highly recommend) then unfortunately I would think of your mental wellbeing and your children\u2019s. They are perceptive, no doubt and can probably sense something as well. It\u2019s always a noble thought to stay in a marriage \u201cfor the children\u2019s sake\u201d but if the parents aren\u2019t happy, the children can definitely feel that tension and it does nobody any good. If you and your wife cannot even have an honest and open conversation about the state of your marriage without it becoming an argument then it might be time to reassess your marriage. Think of yourself. Think of your children.  Think of your wife, too. You still love her. But honestly, she can\u2019t be too happy either, you think? \nIt\u2019s a hard pill to swallow but maybe it is time to look for a lawyer. I would definitely exhaust all resources before heading that route, don\u2019t get me wrong (counseling, therapy, ie) but unfortunately sometimes, some things run their course before you want them to end.

Some of the exercises do feel foolish at the beginning but they do work I promise you. You need to both put back the effort in that you both applied at beginning of relationship. I would suggest maybe setting up some dates, do not talk about home issues,work or kids on these dates. If thinking what we going to talk about then ! What did you talk about before you had kids on dates. I would also recommend talking to your partner about your concerns before giving them the book.

Many times, people say they will change or improve, but that is very difficult to do. Your post reminded me of the life my now husband lived with his ex-wife for 22 YEARS. 22 YEARS of maybe twice a year sex (unless she wanted to get pregnant), no affection, her brushing off or disregarding his feelings, problems never getting solved, etc. They also married extremely young like you two did and were each other's only relationship. While they had 4 kids, they were not partners or spouses in the way a married couple should be in order to set a good example for their children. Their divorce was very bitter, and she alienated his children from him to the point they no longer have a relationship. In their marriage, she acted very similarly to your wife...and never changed...never wanted to. In hindsight, she had mainly wanted a financial provider, not a partner nor did she want to BE a partner. \n\nI often feel so badly for him that he spent all those years not realizing there was more out there. Sure, he had thoughts wondering if there was but would never have left because of his religious upbringing. It was her that had ended it after having several affairs and using him for everything she could. I would hate to see this happen to anyone else. \n\nIf I were you, I would set a time frame in your own mind that you are willing to see if she actually works towards improvement and caring about you. Whether that is 6 months or a year, make sure to observe if these changes are short term (i.e. weeks) or if she actually exhibits changed behavior. If it doesn't improve, PLEASE dont waste your life waiting on someone to care. Studies have shown that children are happier in a healthy, loving environment. They can sense tension/lack of love between parents. It would be better to co-parent and work towards self-love so that you can eventually find someone who *wants* to be a partner and isn't just checking boxes to appease you. Good luck, OP.",

You have to fix it. Talking does nothing. \n\nSpend time with her. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Spend time with her 1 on 1. Get to know her again.

JS.\n\nFor sex life, not tooting my own horn, but she has orgasms every time. Again, not being cocky, just the truth. That's what makes our dwindling sex life confusing. When we have sex, it is a damn good time. It wasn't that long ago when we averaged 1-3 times a day, we've even been known to hammer out a quickie in the laundry room while making dinner, lol\n\nAs for the complaining, I'm not complaining at all, I'm being honest. Wouldn't do me much good if I came in here trying to find advice and made a bunch of stuff up. It's not pretty. It's raw and uncomfortable, and that's what I need to offer to get the raw and uncomfortable answers that can make a difference.

Those things aren't the issue. The issues are communication. Please tell me how showering her with dates and trips fixes the talking? I want the talking, I want to discuss our relationship regularly and make sure we're both having our needs met. Your idea of \"doing something\" is spending money, and that's not life, bro.  That's material's, and materials come and go daily. I want something real and deep, and you can't offer me any help in that realm.

But as someone who\u2019s been married 4 x the way you handled it was very health. I know how to identify unhealthy when it comes to marriage lol . As far as how you both were raised, this is something I do know about. My reactions to my adult life were affected negatively by my dysfunctional childhood. I went to adult children of alcoholics and dysfunction. You don\u2019t have to be raised in an alcoholic home to qualify but a dysfunctional childhood does . Check it out at adult children of alcoholics and dysfunction.org and see if maybe you can relate. If you do look at anything at all check out the laundry list. Maybe I\u2019m off base on this, which would be great . Something you wrote about both your upbringing\u2019s that made me think that. Anyway, good luck to you both !!! Peace",

I'm 43 and been with my husband for 15 years now and it's not that I don't love him anymore, but I'm definitely not \"in love\".. the good news; nothing lasts forever \nThe bad news; nothing lasts forever.\nMarriage is a lot of work and I've been feeling pretty lazy lately .our kids are 13,11,& 6 and by the end of the average day I'm just so exhausted I admittedly expend no effort towards improving the current feeling of stagnation. I've been working on the stuff I can control like going to the gym and staying in shape physically while my husband is the polar opposite of me and completely letting himself go. I'm a huge \"avoider\" when it comes to difficult conversations and I feel absolutely shitty for feeling the way I do. Staying in a marriage to spare my spouse and kids from the pain and potential trauma leaving could cause is super unhealthy and a terrible reason to stay but it is what it is for now.i know if something doesn't change soon my resentment for the situation is going to build up and that's not healthy, either.

I always liked her and wanted to be with her, but she always avoided the situation. So I moved on (sort of) and dated till we were 22. She finally told me she wanted to be with me after rejecting me for so many years. I should\u2019ve given up but there was always something holding me on to her. I was so happy with her for the first 3-4 years. There was a turning point in our relationship when she completely resented my family (it was some small family drama). She made a mountain out of a mole hill and wouldn\u2019t even allow ME to talk to my family. Like she would get made at me if she found out I was talking to my mom. I think that put a lot of resentment inside of me for her. She\u2019s also always been very controlling in our relationship. Simple, small things that wouldn\u2019t bother most she feels like she needs to control.\n\nWe have 0 intimate life at all. And it\u2019s always \u201cbust a nut and roll over\u201d when we do. No connection, no sparks, no desire. We were in this same situation exactly a year ago and these feelings have crept back on me again. Like I fantasize about a life either by myself or with someone else. No one in particular though, just without her. I would never cheat on her, so I\u2019m not in anyway pursuing anyone else. We\u2019ve been married 8 years now and have 2 kids. It\u2019s so hard to feel this way because I grew up with divorced parents and I know how hard it can be. Thankfully they\u2019re only 7 and 5, so if that does become a reality it won\u2019t be too scarring on them. I\u2019ve recommended we do marriage counseling on like 3 different occasions and it never comes to fruition. Idk what to even do anymore man, because I know she\u2019s not happy either. We both deserve to be happy, even if it\u2019s not with each other. \n\nI wish the best for you in your situation man. I really do and it honestly feels good for me to get this out there instead of keeping it built up.",

For 10 years we buried our heads in the sand on every single thing. We never communicated about anything and sex was nearly non-existent. We were coasting as ghosts in a home where it felt like no emotions existed. We were less than roommates. We knew we loved each other but everything was just... gone. I would have breaking points and we would have talks but he would just stare at me and things would kinda get better for like 2 weeks to a month and then we were right back where we started. I had a final breaking point and it was very much how you described yours. The very long talk happened and we have been in couples therapy for about 4 months. It hasn't been all roses or linear (no healing is) but we are the happiest we have ever been. We are always near eachother, touching, kissing, flirting, we consider eachother and communicate all the time and our sex life has gotten so much better. We have been able to fall in love again. It really came down to us both being in the exact same spot with the exact same fears and neither one of us really felt confident or brave enough to truly address it so we just stuck our heads in the sand and coasted unhappily through life, which is a huge regret for both of us, and a part you have to also accept. I can say that we are choosing to look at what feels like wasted years as a major pillar of commitment to eachother. I love my husband so much and I am so grateful that we have found our way back to eachother. I for sure suggest a good couples therapist. I chose a male therapist so that my husband feels like he has an even \"playing field\" and we are so happy with who we are seeing. We also made a deal that no matter what, we talk about it. The sand has been washed away in our marriage. We make time for eachother every single day and we are very happy with our marriage. I hope this provides you some hope. Try and remember the woman you married. She is still there, just a little lost as I am sure you feel the same. Find your way back to eachother... it's possible!",

Me and your wife have the same coping mechanism and it would be often that my spouse and i have the same issue: no communication. What we have found to be effective is to sit near one another and just jot down what it is you feel so that you two can get some communication in without being verbal. Also you going to work earlier/coming home late isn\u2019t the solution, its only going to boil over into a huge nasty argument. When\u2019s the last time you made her feel beautiful or went on a date? Essentially to keep the fire burning between you two.. it\u2019s what she hasn\u2019t said that makes all the difference. You guys cannot stone wall each other because that will not get you anywhere and if you two genuinely want to work it out, you two will have to be willing to put in the work before allowing a 3rd party to intervene. I been in your shoes and found that my s/o is dealing with unresolved trauma but together we are still working thru it together.. it\u2019s all in due time and we, mortals, have lots of it. She may be struggling and keeping it to herself cause she\u2019s in survival mode now. When a man uses the word \u201cDIVORCE\u201d it has weight to it, its not to be used lightly by neither gender.

I am wondering if you have any coworkers or older friends who have stable marriages that you might want to engage more socially, just to be around stability and see it in action.  Some people might suggest going a religious route, but that is up to you.  I have seen many relationships fail in and out of churches.  I think it all depends on how much work you both are willing to put into your relationship and communicating.

By the fact she passively controls the conversations shows who is in charge.  You are continuing to chase her and following her way of doing things.\nYou need to set your expectations for her and your boundaries. Then, you need to have yourself in a position that protects you in the event that she decides that divorce is her choice over fulfilling your expectations. \nSo you need to get yourself financially set and legally set up to not have as much stress or problems through divorce. \n\nGo see a lawyer and get yourself the information for your situation. \nI would change bank accounts so that your income goes to a separate account prior to any divorce or separation. This is because once legal issues start, the courts usually put a legal freeze on your ability to change these things.\nGo cancel all recurring payments on anything that you don't need or use personally because otherwise, you will be paying for them until the divorce is final.\nEven can separate phone bills if you want to make a serious change that she has no way to ignore. \nPersonally, when in a similar situation, I made it clear that i was done working to pay for anything that didn't benefit me or my children directly. \nSo all the things that she does rather than putting energy into improving the relationship get cut off.\nIf she makes her own money, then she can spend it on these things.\nI would only pay the necessary bills, and that's it.\nToo often, men are just doing too much.\nSo many times I have seen where men working 70hrs a week and they don't spend any of the money on themselves having any real things in life or any type of healthy fun or enjoyment. \nIt's simple if you have things you would like to do either alone or with your children, then start doing these things. If she doesn't want to talk about it, then leave her home alone to do nothing. \nGo out and have a good time with your friends or family, especially your children. \nIf she doesn't care that you are out enjoying life, then you know she really doesn't want to be by your side.\nEspecially when she has no access to your financial benefits without asking you directly for access. \nShe can feel what it will be like to be alone, and maybe she actually cares enough to make changes that are positive. \nI don't care if others think my way was wrong. It worked in my situation it made her see that I was not going to just be someone that she used.\n\nI learned the worst thing any man can tell a woman. \"I will love you and be here for you no matter what.\" This is the worst thing men do they yell women to be terrible just to test that man's words. \nInstead, tell her, \"As long as you are treating me good and fun to be around, I will love and want to be with you.\"\nThis makes it clear that she can not slack off and still be able to have whatever she wants from you.\n\nSince doing this and making it clear that not only was I willing and capable of having a happy life without her but that I was a man that other women found attractive and wanted. \nSince this change, she has been way happier as well. She has realized that she gets real enjoyment out of seeing me happy and pleasing me.\nThis also allows me to do things for her without feeling used and neglected or depressed so in turn, she gets more of what she needs.\n\nPersonally, if it would not have worked, I would have just been single because it's pointless to stay with a woman who doesn't want to be a benefit to you.",

And it already IS toxic, sadly. But that doesn\u2019t mean there is no hope.\n\n>\u2026but I feel unhappy and depressed in my married life.\n\nYou need to get into therapy for yourself, regardless of what happens with your marriage. Also, if you aren\u2019t already, get into the gym. This does wonders for your mental health. \n\nAnd, of course, if you are a man of faith, get close with God.\n\n> The biggest fuel to this is we have no communication, zero. She never wants to talk about anything, even when I directly bring up an issue or a subject I'd like to work on, she sits there silently until I feel like I'm talking to a wall and give up. When I brought this up, I was told she needed time to process everything and would get back to me\u2026 she never gets back to me.\n\nAt this point, the only thing TO do to save the marriage will require an ultimatum.\n\nI would find a good couples therapist and book an appointment. \n\nI would also CONSULT with an attorney to see what your rights and options are. Ask questions about the divorce process, custody, assets, etc., as well as how to go about a legal separation if necessary.\n\nThen, sit your wife down and have a serious discussion with her (you may want to RECORD this on you phone). Tell her you are not trying to fight with her and that you love her and want to work on your marriage, so you have booked a marriage counseling appointment for the both of you AND that you have started seeing a therapist for yourself, because you are having trouble communicating your needs with her in such a way that you feel you are being heard.\n\nTell her that she should ALSO start seeing a therapist for herself as well.\n\nIF she is unwilling to do BOTH, then tell her that you will be filing for legal separation because you have reached a limit and cannot continue living this way. This is not healthy for EITHER of you, and it\u2019s certainly not the marriage that you want to exemplify to your KIDS.\n\nTell her that you do not want a divorce, but that if she is unwilling to put in the work on your marriage, that you feel as if it is your only option, because her \u201cpromises\u201d to get back to you after \u201cprocessing\u201d things are empty.\n\nIf she does not change her mind and decide to put in the work for your marriage in three weeks, you will be filing for divorce.\n\nOn the other hand, IF she agrees, then also plan an evening out that includes a nice, romantic restaurant and something fun. Arrange a babysitter for the kids too. Buy her a dress and her favorite candy. Give that to her and tell her you are taking her out for an evening, and what time she should be ready for you to pick her up. \n\nUntil the date, leave her love notes. Surprise her with little, thoughtful gifts. Book her a massage or spa day\u2026\n\nBring her flowers when you pick her up. \n\nTALK to her on your date, but, more importantly, LISTEN. Get HER talking by asking her questions about herself (find a resource on getting to know your wife again). Rebuild intimacy.\n\nDo NOT treat the evening as transactional\u2026 expecting SEX for taking her out.\n\n> I hate the thought of divorce, especially because of the kids\u2026\n\nUnderstood and agreed. This should be a last resort, when you have exhausted every option.",

Fuck that noise, I want to be where I'm happy and enjoy my time, you only have one life to live and I see no reason to suffer through it! And before you break out the middle school \"bet you cry in your pillow\" comment on me, just know I cry in front of people like a real man, because I don't care about your opinion. I've experienced things in this life that 99% will never know happens in reality, and it has made me a strong man who knows how precious life is. Find yourself some happiness, friend.

        "text": "My husband and I got married almost a year ago and we're having a baby soon. We're both really excited to meet him, but we've run into some trouble with his family. His mom, although very generous, can be very controlling. She expects for us to be at every Sunday dinner or she'll be hurt. \n\nAs I'm 8.5 months pregnant, I've gone over there less and less because I'm very tired and gearing up for the baby. Not to mention, I am not entirely comfortable with my in-laws because of some racial tension and comments made by them. \n\nTo make a long story short, his dad asked me if I grew up eating fried chicken the first time I met them. I was shocked to say the least. My husband didn't take up for me-no one did, so the racism is pretty casual, but the family doesn't see it as an issue since they don't say the \"n-word\", I guess...\n\nAnyway, my husband and I have deconstructed these comments and he has understood that he grew up with racism and, especially with becoming a father of a mixed son, he has worked hard to rid himself of blindspots.\n\nLast year, in anticipation of my husband and I starting a family, I tried to have a sit-down with his mom who has said some things and would presumably be around my son the most. She deflected and said that she won't be blamed for my past trauma.\n\nA year later, I've distanced myself, again because I'm tired and pregnant (still working full time) and she had a problem with this. I was honest and let her know why and she was completely unwavering in her stance that her racially-insensitive comments have anything to do with me creating space.\n\nMy husband went to talk with her to set boundaries about us being present EVERY Sunday, but come to find out, she told my husband that she thinks I'm a bad influence on him, thinks that our son is at risk of being amoral because I didn't write thank you cards after our wedding (just me), and that I'm not doing enough around the house and I'm making my husband do too much (again, 8.5 months pregnant; still working, cooking, doing chores, making honey-do lists, doing a course, etc). She also said that she doesn't understand how my husband is so close with my family, considering that they live out of state and we only get to see them a couple times a year. \n\nAfter hearing all of that, my husband and I feel that it might be best for her to have limited to no contact with our son once he's born. She pretends that everything is fine when I'm there, but does and says all this underhanded crap to my husband, thinking he won't tell me what was said. Any advice on how to proceed? \n\ntl;dr \nMIL talking behind my back, says I'm a bad influence on her son, believes my son will not have morals and doesn't like my husband's closeness with my family. DH and I thinking of going no-contact",

        "post-author": "SaveMyMarriage518",
        "text": "I know what I did was wrong. I am now struggling with how to seek resolution and begin healing my marriage. A few weeks ago, my wife found that I had been on a porn site\u2014it was a cam site, but I *did not* interact or pay, I am new to this so I just was watching in the free area (only adding this because she continue to bring this up and says she refuses to believe that I didn\u2019t interact or pay, despite what I profess). Porn is a bright line for her and I terribly screwed up by crossing that boundary. I know it was wrong. I have admitted to this and am trying to take full ownership. In the wake of this, I have tried to be as honest as possible even if the truth is painful.\n\nShe confronted me in an absolute rage that day and I immediately confessed to being there and masturbating to it. She is vehement that this is *not* masturbation but rather that it is full on cheating and \u201cf*cking the cam girl.\u201d She pressed for how many other times I had done this, and I was honest (2 other times, once in 2024 & once in 2022\u2013both of those were \u201cregular\u201d porn, not live cams if there is any difference, I am obviously clueless about this). Just for context, we have sex maybe once a month, and the times I have used porn have been during months-long spells without sex\u2014this is *NOT* a defense or justification, as it would still be wrong if we hadn\u2019t had sex in 15 years, but it is just an explanation for why I was masturbating in the first place. I recognize that when I did it I was probably justifying it to myself with the dry spell, as well as to be a \u201cnice guy\u201d and not pressure her into sex when I know she\u2019s not interested. I now clearly see the horrible flaw in that line of thinking and should have communicated my needs, but when I say that she then says, \u201cOh so it\u2019s my fault for not satisfying your needs?!\u201d Which is not what I am trying to get across\u2026it was my failure to communicate, that\u2019s all. I have never once pressured her into sex, as I respect her autonomy.\n\nShe kicked me out of the house that day, I spent 19 days in hotels before being allowed back in this weekend, but the tension is palpable and I\u2019m living in the basement. During that time apart we met a couple of times and I have owned up to this transgression, I have not minimized it, have not been defensive, have not asked for her to feel any differently about it. She calls this outright cheating and says that I am \u201cf*cking that woman online,\u201d which I have not challenged at all, as I know that\u2019s her truth. However, I do feel like there is a difference between the two; I recognize I may be wrong, so I am not pushing back. She gets extremely reactive if I say I was \u201cmasturbating\u201d or \u201clooking at porn\u201d and berates me saying I am \u201cfcking that woman\u201d and cheating on her. I would never in a million years cheat on my wife in the \u201creal world\u201d (neither physically nor emotionally), so it tremendously pains me to hear those words, but I was extremely blinded by the veil of the computer screen and the one-way nature of it made it feel like it was less evil than she sees it. I now see that it hurts her just the same, so I have not shared my naivety on why I felt like it was a lesser crime, because ignorance is not a good reason, especially when I knew porn is wrong to begin with.\n\nShe now wants us to sell our house and separate for 1-3 years until I can work on myself to heal as an individual and not until then can we begin to mend our marriage. I said that I felt like that was a path to a divorce. It also feels like avoidance, which I am actively focused on directly confronting problems right now rather than avoiding. In my heart, I feel like if we sell and separate for 1-3 yrs that would be a huge overreaction, but I have not said that directly. I think digging in and going to couples therapy is the path forward, she is refusing (she says maybe in the future, but no promise). I want to fight for my marriage, and I am willing to take all of the arrows and bullets in person to do so, but she won\u2019t agree to that. What do I do here?\n\n\nJust for more context about how I am trying to respond here (not saying this is enough to heal this pain, just sharing that I\u2019m trying my best to respond positively and in ways that are speaking to her love languages), while I was kicked out, I went to the house several times (with permission) to handle as much housework as I could as an act of service so she could relax and not lift a finger when she\u2019d get home. One day I used a sick day to spend 6 hours deep cleaning everything from top to bottom. Another day I pressure washed the entire exterior. Came and handled every chore in the house another day despite living in a hotel 30 min away. Brought flowers 3x, sent cookies, communicated my efforts to improve & heal (I have gone to multiple workshops, got in with a therapist, and have been introspective and journaling the entire time we\u2019ve been apart). \n\nMaybe my efforts are in vain? I desperately want to save my marriage, any advice is welcome. Up until this point, we have had a very loving 8-year marriage, and just the day before this all came crashing down we were saying how we love our life. Certainly there were some issues, but we had been navigating them. Now they are all being brought back up in 10x fashion due to how I have shattered her reality and the marriage is being dragged through the dirt as though we had this horrible corpse of a marriage that had been propped up. I am reeling and don\u2019t know what to believe.\n\nTL;DR: I was caught watching porn about a month ago. This is not a recurring issue, but it is a bright line for my wife. She wants to separate and will not commit to couples therapy until we each have healed individually, which is an ambiguous distinction.",

It IS emotional abuse. Insidious kind too. \n\nI used to bring up my spouses sins when we'd argue. I would use always/never language. I was hurt and it was a way to inflict on them shame.

It really hurts as it undermines my contributions and I end up feeling defensive, because it distorts the reality of the past and is a way of \u201canchoring\u201d the history towards her desired narrative.\n\nI am very confident that she is not seeing anyone else or even flirting. This reaction is coming from a moral belief and value of hers\u2014which she is entitled to and I ought to have either confronted it or adhered to it, not just say ok and then flippantly cross it.\n\nYes, she is often extreme and has highly convicted/intense opinions on most things. I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s room for debate when she takes a strong stance, so I lay down when I disagree (my own issue that I need to address how I approach conflict vs. avoiding, which has been a lifelong habit for the most part).\n\nHistrionic\u2026in some ways (excessive/shifting emotions, self-dramatization/victimhood), but not others (not seductive, not an inappropriate dresser, not the \u201clook at me\u201d type out in public, however the focus very often comes back to her within our relationship even if I\u2019m trying to talk about myself, so perhaps differently?).\n\nWe are not connected as a couple, as demonstrated by the lack of physical intimacy. Physical intimacy feels very transactional in our relationship\u2014it often feels like I can only earn it after putting in all of this effort in all aspects, but even then it usually isn\u2019t enough and it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not on the table (a topic will inevitably come up about how stressful work is or how she\u2019s not feeling well right at that point in the evening, which feels like code for \u201cdon\u2019t even try\u201d), so I don\u2019t push for it. That makes me feel rejected, and at times, I would rather not put in effort than feel rejected. I get it that there needs to be an emotional connection, particularly for women. But physical intimacy is a way that I feel connected. Ergo, it\u2019s a death cycle in the bedroom.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to sound like the victim here, but it feels like that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I don\u2019t know what to do.",

However, if you can actually count how many times you've had intimacy in a number of months, be able to point this out to her and she repeatedly dismisses you, then she is not respecting you or acknowledging what you need and expect in your marriage. I feel guilty if I go more than 3 days without intimacy with my spouse. I cannot even fathom months at a time. So your seeking out behavior is something she should be able to logically understand if it's an issue you've discussed and there is nothing but dismissal and being diminished and told that your needs don't matter. \n\nI wouldn't be shocked that you feel defeated and deflated in your marriage. You need to do something to earn her respect back. Not just apologizing and appeasement. I mean like stand up to her and say \"I'm meeting you halfway here, and I need you to understand X does X to me, and when you say and do X I feel at a loss.\" \n\nA lot about marriage is NEGOTIATION. You have to learn what is tolerable for you to accept overall. Allow for compromise. She isn't doing this. \n\nShe has already decided for you both that she wants out. She found her reason, she's not giving up that bone she's chewing over. Does that make sense? I totally know what you mean about the death cycle thing, I think that a lot of couples together for a long time can experience this at some point for any number of reasons. It's whether you can find your way back out with both people coming to terms of agreement, having empathy and understanding for the other person and having a level of sacrifice, duty and love to extend themselves for their spouse. You seem to be doing a ton of self-reflecting and figuring out how to communicate better and approach things. If she's not willing to join you on that path and improve things then I would agree with a separation being the answer here.",

That\u2019s on me. \n\nPorn isn\u2019t a topic in our house because it just doesn\u2019t come up and I have used it 3 times total in 10+ years, so it\u2019s not something on my mind. The times I used it, I was horny and in a dry spell in the bedroom and it was a spur of the moment thing. No forethought, she was out of the house so I did it and felt shameful afterwards. Our sex life has gone from the initial romance 2x/day to now 1-2x a month or many times less. We\u2019ve had sex 3 times since Thanksgiving. I have never turned her down for porn, I think only once ever did I turn her down at all because I was feeling like shit (I remember this because I tested positive for Covid the next day).",

You just need to flat out state this to her...I'm gonna do something I don't normally do and suggest giving her the benefit of the doubt...she may not have realized it's dropped off *to that extent*.   If she has, however, it's completely unrealistic and unfair of her to expect you to be completely celibate if the sex continues to drop off, you still have needs too.\n\nNow, if she's not in the mood all that frequently...maybe suggest to her that she take some naughty photos(when she's feeling sexy/confident but not really in the mood) for your eyes only when your needs do kick into high gear..that way you've got some material to use..\n\nThere's some communication on both parts here that needs doing, but maybe start with the above.   Try to avoid blaming as much as you can.   It's still you two against the problem",

Because that emotional intimacy is subjective, and sometimes it doesn\u2019t matter how much effort I have put in or how close it feels like we are and even in those instances it\u2019s often that sex is still non-existent. We can have a great week of connecting and cap it off with a fun date night, but then it usually takes a turn at the end and reasons come up\u2014not physically feeling well, exhausted from work, just so tired in general ready to fall asleep, etc.\u2014which if I voice an opposition I would sound like an asshole. Or the topic shifts to some stressor in her life, which has been a subversive shutdown tactic. Either way, that makes me feel rejected.\n\nOr 2) \u201cWe have sex probably every other week\u201d which is factually incorrect, and even that amount would feel insufficient. But when I point out that she\u2019s overstating how often it occurs, then the shift is to how I\u2019m keeping tally of when we have sex. At one point she seemed to admit to the lack of sex in our marriage but then went on to say, \u201cOk fine, but we are still having sex once a month, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re \u2018not getting it\u2019 and need to go to some sex worker.\u201d",

Do understand that the more you use porn, the more you need it. It is an addiction that can get out of hand.\n\nModeration in everything, that's the key.

We meet from 6 pm to 11 pm usually\n3. We don't get drunk\n4. We don't blast music loudly, although we might get carried away by the game and get loud ourselves, specially if playing Smash.\n5. We all are 35-40 yo\n6. I've been married for 10 years now\n7. We don't have any kids\n8. We rotate the house in which we meet except my house\n\nWe bought this place 5 years ago, it was run down and in very bad shape, over the years we have improved it and it is in much better shape now, to the point that I feel comfortable bringing people, but my wife does not feel like we are there yet, and she feels the house needs more renovations for that to happen. But in reality I know that won't be the case for two reasons, 1. she is a perfectionist, this house won't be up to her standards ever, we would have to tear  the whole place down and build it from the ground up, and 2. even if that happens the real problem is she doesn't like my friends, that is the real reason she doesn't want them to come.\n\nNow, I feel I have a right to bring people home, within limits of course, like we won't stay too late, I even negotiated with her that they would leave at 10 pm tops for instance, and that we would meet in my place once a month tops, but in practice that would be once each 2 months based on the rotation cadence and that there are weeks we can't meet.\n\nI have told her that there must be a middle ground we can reach, not bringing them at all would be on one extreme, and bringing them each week would be on the other end of the extreme. She just won't relent.\n\nThis issue has been putting a lot of strain on my marriage like I have never felt in over 10 years we have been married/dating. TBH, I don't care that much about my friends, I am not choosing them over her. What I care about is my independence and my right to enjoy the house the way I want. I am not insisting in bringing them home for THEM, I am doing this for ME, because this is something I want for ME.\n\nIf she does not compromise I think I will just bring them and that's it, I will just let her know this is happening and that's it, we will see what happens then.\n\nAm I in the wrong here? Or am I right to want to bring people home? She doesn't really have friends, just some acquaintances, mostly she sees family members and she have brought them home, which is fine by me. I have brought family members as well.\n\ntl;dr I wan't to bring friends home and my wife won't let me. Is this a red flag for my marriage?",

I\u2019m married (70m) and have found that MANY women have a huge thing about their home being like their identity when it comes to appearance. Maybe her not liking your friend\u2019s point has a meaning behind it you don\u2019t understand. EVEN if both of those issues aren\u2019t the problem she may has other reasons that you don\u2019t know of. We as men are so different from women so respect her wishes, don\u2019t make a big deal out of it to your friends. Don\u2019t make her out to be the problem to others outside your marriage. Protect your wife. Honor her by giving in. You will reap the rewards. \n\nWhen we were engaged 41 years ago another older couple casually when discussing getting along mentioned that what good would it do if a disagreement happened and you \u201cwon\u201d the fight and she or he ended up hating your guts. As a man you would not be in a good place relationship wise with her and any intimacy would go out the window. I personally would start there at that approach. \n\nI was not raised like this to give preference to my wife. My dad was not a good example but of course I loved him. He sadly passed away a few years ago. He never bought my mom a birthday present or did a romantic thing for Valentines. It was all about him. I had to learn it the hard way. I also had to forgive my dad and accept him as he was. He had many fine qualities but sadly my mom who is still living at 99 had to accept the faults in him. She lowered her bar and accepted him. \n\nI\u2019m still learning the very type of things that you are mentioning. The learning never stops. Coincidentally, I am meeting at our Church\u2019s office with a group of men (35-40) that break up into small groups after watching a short video on Vimeo from an organization called Betterman. Their video content and different subjects are available online. The basis of Betterman is to make you basically a better husband, a better dad, a better leader and protector and provider to your wife and a better father to your children. Our current 5 week session is on Women. We are guys so we don\u2019t hold back when discussing (all remains confidential). Basically there is nothing new under the sun the older you get. We as men can so selfish and clueless. \n\nSo I wish you the best and will pray for you and your relationship with your wife. I know that it is a VERY difficult road at times. She is worth it so don\u2019t bail on her physically and emotionally. \u2764\ufe0f",

Your wife doesn't mind your playing and spending time with your friends (whom she doesn't like \u2013 why, BTW?), as long as it's not at your home? \n\nAs you said it yourself, you really do need to find some compromise here. For example, if she feels uncomfortable because of unfinished home repairs and improvements, try to agree with her on specific timeframe or specific improvements which will need to be done before your friends can come over.\n\nYou're not wrong in insisting that you should be able to host your friends at your home, but I would be careful initiating direct conflict before you exhaust every possibility to find a solution together. At the end of the day, a successful marriage is always based on good communications and ability to understand each other and compromise. It's worth investing some serious effort into before giving up, especially after 10 years together.",

Some other times she might tell me she doesn't want me to buy something for instance, but I do anyway, just because I want and can. That has never been a real issue because it has always been smaller unimportant things, I see it more like a pull and push which I assume is normal in any relationship. \n\nThis issue with my friends has been different because she is set on not wanting them here, and I have been set in bringing them.

Like unfinished and needed some dry wall or a complete gut and restart? Where are you currently in the remodel? \n\nThe reason why I ask is because it seems that there may be something else in the background. Having friends over is fine because you live there. It is also her space too so I wonder if she is uncomfortable with people over in general, or your friends, or is worried about the judgement of the space. I would ask some direct questions on the underlying discomfort and then decide from there. \n\nIt just may be she is more introverted and doesn't like people in her home. There is space for compromise. Maybe she can take the time they are over to do something she likes outside the house or join some local groups through MeetUp. She doesn't have to do it with others but make it a personal adventure. \n\nWhat I wouldn't suggest is just doing what you want and telling her to suck it up. You will make things worse, it will not solve things long term, and she will start to resent the invasion.",

        "text": "For context, feel free to look at my last post\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/s/yyXDofNXCG\n\nAfter almost leaving my marriage, my husband is doing everything he can to save our relationship. He has been making promises to get us out of my grandma\u2019s home and be the sole provider of our family after 3 years of being reliant on family and government assistance. He is a delivery driver, a YouTuber and full time student. \n\nRegardless of whether or not he is able to provide for our family, he has made it clear he wants me to be home to homeschool our child and be a present mother and wife even though I told him I could get a job so that we could move out. Even if he is able to fully provide, I can\u2019t help but feel disconnected from him. He is finally stepping up after I\u2019ve already given up due to the extremities I have faced for the last 6 years of our marriage. \n\nAlthough he is genuinely trying to make this work, I feel that my heart has grown a hole that I can\u2019t fix overnight. A part of me wants to stick it out especially for our child, but in the last few weeks of contemplating divorce I truly felt free and myself again. I felt like I had something to look forward to again. \n\nHe has been constantly complimenting me, showing me affection, asking me how I feel, but I force myself every time to get to that level with him but I don\u2019t feel it. I can\u2019t say no to sex with him so I find myself giving him my body when I prefer to not be in that way with him until I decipher my feelings about this marriage. I also feel that I use sex to prolong decisions & hide what I\u2019m actually feeling to prevent hurting his feelings. \n\nI\u2019ve been scouring the Bible to see if I have a legal right to leave this marriage, and 1 Corinthians expresses that downside of marriage and goes on to explain that a wife should not leave her marriage and if she does she cannot remarry unless her husband passes away. \n\nI feel selfish for staying with him when he could be with someone who would be in love with him, but I know it would break his heart if I told him I don\u2019t want this anymore. He\u2019s trying but I fear I\u2019m already checked out and afraid to spend another day lying to myself. I am hoping it gets better and that I find myself falling in love with him again. Maybe the situation is still too fresh, but in time I pray it gets better so that the Lord remains pleased with me. \n\nTL;DR: after years of emotional & verbal abuse my husband is regretful and actively becoming a better husband, but I am no longer in love with him as a result of the pain I endured.

                "body": "Look. I am not a theologian.  And a \u201clegal\u201d right is not a great way to look at it.  In theory Bible there are three different types of laws.  Jesus came to fulfill the law of salvation, but there are two other types of laws (civil and moral).  Divorce lands somewhere in those two.  The reason for Civil law is to help maintain order among people living with each other.  The moral law is to help people live the best life you are able to, for example honor your father and mother is an example of a moral law because it is good for you personally to do so.  Divorce is a bit of a cross over between the two because divorce feels with more than just yourself and it also is moral law because it is also many times it is for your own good as well. \n\nHis tells us He hates divorce. Why? Because of the damage it causes to everyone in proximity.  Yet at the same time, He said there are reasons for divorce because there are times when it is absolutely necessary and also I believe (personally) that it is to encourage couples to actually work on their relationship and not take it for granted (because if there was no means to leave a relationship it would be hell for many marriages because of the abuse that would unfold.   \n\nThe third commandment (or \u201cstatement\u201d as I like to say) is a strange one.  Do not use the Lords name in vain.  And what makes it strange is that it is the only commandment that tells us, God won\u2019t forgive.  Which sounds incredibly weird.  I studied this for a long time and found that it is not talking about using \u201cJesus\u201d or saying \u201cGod damnit\u201d (although that last one can have a different argument of being bad but not because of the 3rd commandment). Instead it is talking about using the name of God (his teachings and essence of who He is) for your own vanity\u2026 or rather for your own purposes.  And that He would say this is not forgivable is to show the severity of weight on this command.  Yet we see the Bible being misused left, right and center and I am certain the God does not like it one bit and it shows when Jesus called out the Pharisees, that they blasphemed the Holy Spirit and that it was not forgivable. \n\nAll of that mini-sermon to say.  Are you looking to leverage the Bible for your own vanity?  Look, if you divorce your husband for whatever reason, that is on you.  And I won\u2019t/can\u2019t stop you, but just know that there will be damage if you do.  But if you do it and are looking for an excuse for your own gain from the Bible, you won\u2019t find it and I advise that you don\u2019t look for it, because you are crossing a line if you do.  You just need to be honest with yourself and not justify yourself. \n\nNow that that warning is out of the way. I know what it is like feeling trapped in a marriage that you don\u2019t feel much toward your spouse because of how they have treated you.  Here is what I have personally done.  I have leaned more into the relationship and I have taken my relationship as a mechanism that helps me grow better as a person.  My skin is unbelievably thick now and I have learned what is something I can do vs something that is out of my control. \n\nI found the book, Love and Respect pretty helpful.  When I would actively practice my spouses love languages, I would find myself becoming a better person that I loved.  Sure they got to receive something but I was surprised at how much I was able to receive by being such a better person. But that is me and my story, I don\u2019t know if it would work with you.",

Then after some time she hugged me and tried kissing me intimately and I told her that pls not today to which she replied I k ow I have stopped wanting you for a long time now. (Ps. We have been very intimate with each other this whole week and she was the one initiating most of the time since we are trying for a baby). I got a little mad and when I came back from the gym she saw me and asked what had happened. I told her I didn\u2019t like the way you talked to me and she said the word \u201csorry\u201d and went in the room. At one time in the week she said that our baby which was born 2 years ago is good for us as she was looking for a sign whether to leave me or not. I was hurt very badly at that but never said anything since we never fought that much. She tried talking to me after 2, 3 hours and I said we are fine to which she started crying. I heard her and went up to her and tried talking things out to which she said to lower my voice so neighbors don\u2019t hear me as I was winning the argument and she had to apologize to me. (This has been her go to sentence to tell me to lower my voice whenever she feels she is loosing the argument). It was 12:30 am and I stopped talking to her immediately and went outside the house to clear my mind and sat on walkway in front of my house. She saw me from ring camera and said if this is the solution we can go outside for a drive to breathe. I didn\u2019t reply and after 2, 3 minutes I saw her coming put of the house with our 2 year old baby wrapped in blanket who had been sick for two days but fine now and unlock her car, but when she saw me sitting at the curb she sat with me and I didn\u2019t want to argue again so I moved. After 5 minutes I told her to give me our son so he might not get sick again and she said we are coming inside as well. I came back and laid on the bed. She put our son on the bed and started crying so loyd that our neighbor had definitely heard it. \nNow what do I do. She starts crying every time when she does not get her way and starts fighting with me every time things do not geo her way.\n\ntl;dr: my wife says very hurtful things but starts crying whenever I feel hurt and get mad.",

Somehow the story of the pillow is related to her looking for a reason to leave you, but a child is good for you guys.  Very confusing.  How did the kissing you fit into this, that causes you to get mad and go to the gym?  Perhaps use some paragraphs.",

        "text": "My husband and I are in our early 30's and married for just over a year. We have a reoccurring argument that I cannot seem to figure out.\n\nFor example, he doesn't clean at all but that's because he says he has different cleaning standards than I do. I'm medium-level clean I don't clean like crazy but don't want the house to be a disaster or unsanitary. I said I'm worried one day when I'm gone a lot (my job will require me to travel a lot) he won't clean at all like now and I will come home to a disaster of a house and continue carrying the mental load. He said that's probably true because he doesn't have the same standard as I do and when I ask him if he could understand that total chaos gives me anxiety he said he will not be changed.\n\nThis is an example of the reoccurring argument. He views really anything like this - that he is being changed/controlled - when I bring up an issue. When it comes to day to day life stuff I struggle with having to hold in any concerns I have or worries because he gets mad and says I am controlling/changing him.\n\nIn these arguments he also says he has no desire to make me happy, which of course you have to make yourself happy first, but the same issue arises for other things - like I told him I would love flowers once in awhile and he says he is not that type of guy and that he would never do that. Me wanting that would be changing him.\n\ntl;dr I'm unsure if I am being controlling/unreasonable or if husband is not putting in effort and that it will become a bigger issue one day",

Did you guys get married after a month of dating or something?\n\n\n\n\n\nMarriage is a partnership, you'll have to do things you don't really want to do for the sake of your partners happiness. Just like they should do for you. It's a give and take situation that you do because you love this person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to cleaning, that's a big deal. Nobody wants to live in a dirty house, and it's crazy to me your husband would say he doesn't care. That in itself deserves some malicious compliance.. If I were you I'd take a week off from him and go visit some family and see how he actually deals with it, and if he does actually not clean up for himself when you get back then only clean the areas you use. Or actually you might not even have to leave.. Just don't clean up after him anymore if he wants to act like a child. \n\n\n\n\n\nLet it be known your both adults, your both married to eachother and you are not his mother. There's no need to be cleaning up after someone who thinks living in a trash heap is ok. That's gross. Now if you were a clean freak and he was a regular cleaner that would be different because that's just overboard. \n\n\n\n\n\nOn another note... \nIt baffles me on how many posts I see with similar content. Not exactly this but I mean in a sense where it seems like they just married a stranger. I also feel like people take marriage lightly these days. I think people should actually get to know the person they're going to marry before marrying them. I feel like people these days are just like whatever, I'll get a divorce and find someone else. That's crazy to me too.",

It's just that I constantly see posts similar that idk.. I feel like people should actually know the person they're going to marry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile you were dating, did you go to his place? Did you not see signs of unclean living? Or did he have roommates that could have possibly been cleaning up after him?",

Our couples therapist has thrown out suggestions for how to say things, what to say and to do at home. So far I\u2019ve been the only one doing. He\u2019s admitted that it feels hokey, even to the therapist. \n\nI\u2019m starting to think he\u2019ll never see my side of things. He pretty much insinuated tonight that I\u2019m the problem, and our lack of affection is on me and he won\u2019t take ownership. I\u2019ve been trying to talk to him about our issues for some time. Even today I brought something up. Our toddler came into the room and he says not now, we need to talk about this later. Tonight he turned on a movie after kids went down and passed out within 10 minutes. \n\nSorry, probably missing key details or context.

This is so Men have a higher likelihood of raising and caring for their offspring. Weird right?\u2026..but as guys we have a lot of catching up to do and we have no idea initially what we are doing. \n\nHe should feel blessed though, we haven\u2019t had any intimacy for over 8 months. She tore pretty good couldn\u2019t have sex the last trimester despite our efforts. Sometimes you gotta change your perspective. Children are hard, it\u2019s gonna be a challenge, you gotta learn how to navigate this properly\u2026. Shit sucks my wife and I have both had our struggles. Sleep deprivation, added pressure, lack of connection or intimacy\u2026.on top of having a newborn\u2026.  It does get easier and he will love that child. But I wouldn\u2019t wait for the 6 month mark before having this talk.",

Not in regards to the husband\u2019s hormones\u2014which is a very good point\u2014but psychologically, the husband may be feeling a little jealous of the attention that the baby is getting now instead of him. This isn\u2019t logical and may be hard for him to really put into words, but we all have feelings that are illogical sometimes\u2026\n\nOP sounds like she\u2019s doing everything that can reasonably be expected of her, so I don\u2019t think she should take it to heart or let it stress her out that her husband feels under appreciated. I actually think it\u2019s good that he expressed himself here rather than keeping his feelings bottled up, and I think that she should be patient with him as he adjusts to the new reality and keep the lines of communication open.",

Nine times out of ten in marriage (from my perspective, anyway) giving one\u2019s spouse the benefit of a doubt and responding with patience is the better for both parties.

In the delivery room, when you felt annoyed with his Netflix, that would\u2019ve been a time to tell him, in no uncertain terms, that he needed to be sitting there alert to your needs, even if it was boring for him.  If he had a problem with that, then that would\u2019ve been a good time to tell him to get F out the room.",

That's great, seriously. But that's not the same thing at appreciation. You are doing a fantastic job of holding up your side of the household. But that's not the same thing as appreciation. That's one of the differences between men and women. My wife feels it when I help, especially with the kids. She essentially wants me to say, \"I see you carrying that heavy load. Let me lighten it for a bit.\" I don't work like that. I actually feel worse if she helps. I don't want her help. I want her adoration. I want her to say,  \"I see how hard you work for us, and I think you're awesome for it.\" Maybe you think you're saying that with all you do, but that's not what he's hearing. So tell him how much you appreciate him. Tell him how strong he is. Tell him how sexy he is to you.  I bet that will change his attitude over time. He'll probably even find the energy then to do more when he gets home.",

I believe our bond might be a trauma bond, anxious attachment, avoidant, any combination of all three or more.  We do get along well and have fun together.  \u201cShe\u201d comes from a rather sex-shamed upbringing, and mine was based on sexual repression that I chose to revolt from.  I don\u2019t believe in breaking up a family, non-consensual sex, or anything truly immoral but I am definitely not a prude.  Over the past 10 years my wife has slowly ended our sexual relationship.  I am 50.  She is 45.\nI get accused of being the problem, and there is always a HUGE variety of reasons given but I\u2019m just going to say that I am not an asshole or cold person.  I have really tried to always improve myself and be a good selfless partner.  It hasn\u2019t always been natural for me but I feel like I try my hardest with what I have to provide a good life for her and our kids (now almost out of the house).\n\nI don\u2019t know if she is cheating on me in the traditional way, if she has some other type of sexual excitement in her life, if she has become Asexual, or what.  But she has just gone completely cold to me, and makes the conversations about this aspect of our relationship difficult, brief, and seemingly full of landmines that I always step on. \nI am the only one who brings up marriage counseling.  It feels like she is just wanting to be roommates who are friends, best friends, etc..which is \u201cfine\u201d\u2026but, you know what I mean??\n\nTl;dr - I can\u2019t tell if I am being lied to by my wife about the past present and future of our sex life.  Although I am open-minded about sex, I have never cheated on her\u2014but it also feels like she conveniently characterizes me of just being interested in sex.  When in fact, I have just noticed that she is doing everything possible (including communicating with me) to avoid sex/intimacy.  I do not know how to communicate all of this, to her (again), to a marriage counselor (alone), or just file for divorce. Please offer a perspective.  Thank you",

Get some coaching in communication and boundary enforcement \n\n> Although I am open-minded about sex, I have never cheated on her\u2014but it also feels like she conveniently characterizes me of just being interested in sex.  \n\nCould she be right?  You aren't asking how to make the marriage better.  You aren't asking how to understand her or to make her happier.   The only thing you mentioned is you getting sex. \n\n\nMy advice :  go to her and say \"I want you to have a great marriage.  We both deserve a great marriage.   I want to make one relationship between so I'm going to marriage counseling.    Would you consider doing me a favor and coming along?  It would really help the counselor help me.\".   Then you make the appointment.  If she ends up not going, go anyway.       \n\nIf she will never ever go, then you just commit to solo therapy.    You are 50% of the dynamic in the relationship. You have the power to change things",

It's also possible that she only ever wanted sex with you to make babies (though ten years old is awfully young to be \"almost out of the house\").\u00a0\n\nBut the vibes I get from this are that she has had problems with the marriage for a long time and you have never had good communication. From her perspective you ignored or minimized her feelings about the marriage and treated her as a bang maid (though she would never use that term herself). It was only her loss of sexual interest that caused you to belatedly ask her what was wrong, which was a further turn off.\u00a0\n\nMarriage counseling might still be helpful, though not as much as it would have been five years ago. You can't treat it as a sexual fix though. She needs to feel heard. And even if she is, the relationship might be too far gone.\u00a0",

To a certain extent\u2014I agree with your hunch, and really I think your hunch is about as accurate as can be, given your actual familiarity with me/her/our relationship.  \n\nWe are both working class, hard workers, raising two kids.  They\u2019re good kids. \n\nBOTH of us have had real life struggles that are difficult to hang up\u2026and before we met.  Our relationship hasn\u2019t been a bad one.  And it has had its struggles. She works hard, I work hard.  We usually work together really well.  It feels like she just wants to be friends.  \nIt\u2019s hard to feel demoted.  I feel lucky to be considered her friend.  I\u2019m being quietly quit. But I feel like she is staying \u201cfor a reason\u201d that isn\u2019t a pillar of a solid relationship.  \n\nIt\u2019s like we are together for survival.  Which isn\u2019t horrible. But it also hasn\u2019t been fairytale.  And she is an absolutely voracious reader.  She wants fairytale and constant schedule adherence. .  I am salt of the earth and sometimes free-spirited. \n\nI don\u2019t view her as a fuckmaid, but feel like I\u2019ve been typecast AS that because I\u2019ve asked why everything else gets done EXCEPT for that.  It became a focus, and then I\u2019m accused of \u201cjust wanting sex\u201d but it\u2019s not black and white like that. \nActually THIS spin is incredibly frustrating because I love her so much and really am not a dog like that.  But I get accused of that and it\u2019s just not accurate.  Any thoughts on how to communicate on this ?",

                                "body": "Again, this is speculative, but this tracks with a common pattern in communication problems. Like many men, you are task oriented; that is, you have something like a list of things in your head that is expected of you, and another list of things that are expected of her. If you do your tasks well, then you've done your job. She's doing everything you want and expect except for sex.\n\nOften, women don't think like that. It's hard to articulate exactly what the difference is, but it's more of an intuitive, interactive approach to things. She kind of expects a spouse to periodically look around, see festering problems or things that aren't getting done, and step up without having to be asked. A failure to do so is seen as a lack of empathy and/or maturity. A husband that doesn't do that is more of a business partner than a romantic one.\n\nI'm not saying this is the whole root of the lack of sexual interest, but it may well be a big part, and is well worth working on for its own sake, with or without counseling. But still . . . ten years. I don't know if this is fixable after such a long time, even if it would have been before. Good luck, man, this is a tough one.",

        "text": "please be patient w me as i am not much of a reddit user but i have no one to talk to. \n\nI (F25) married my wife (F29) about a year and so ago. we had only been dating for a few months before we decided to get married; i know don\u2019t need to say anything about it. i was honestly ok w the commitment as i had been previously engaged for about 2.5 years and considered she would also be prepared for our marriage since she was about to get married to her gf but found out she cheated (this happened more than 5 years ago). \n\nat the time we got married, we lived in different states since she was military (i was living in the same city her & i grew up). after we got married, i decided to move w her and take a big step in leaving my independent life (i lived by myself and worked 2 jobs) and my family (i moved more than 700 miles away from home). i didn\u2019t care much since i was coming to live w my wife and i wanted to take a mental break from my very busy life. i would have to say that i started to notice her detachment from me a month or 2 after living together: she was distant & not as loving as she portrayed herself to be when we started dating. she did tell me she was a very introverted and quiet person but i don\u2019t see how that means avoidant and cold to your spouse. eventually (& ever since) some family members moved in w us and we have not had an exclusive space for ourselves which kinda made it worse. we only had alone time for 2 month after moving in together and i became a non priority. she started disrespecting me & yelling at me in front of her family, not caring about me, being distant, ignoring me if i was upset at her or vice versa. eventually i introduced the idea of couples counseling because i felt like i was going insane and also asked her to see a therapist (she was taking SSRI\u2019s but never actually had a therapy session). i did start looking for therapists myself but more because i felt like i was in a very stuck space of feeling like my wife just doesn\u2019t give a f*ck about me and just doesn\u2019t wanna tell me. things started to get worse ofc. i kept getting ignored for days, talked to in a very belittling way & abused mentally. when we went to counseling i didn\u2019t feel like anything was solved or talked about: she confessed that anytime i would be upset w her she would mentally solve things on her own (pls wtf) and not tell me anything but also blame a lot on her \u201cmilitary lifestyle\u201d. \n\nas of a couple weeks to months ago, i told her i feel very disconnected to her, like im a roommate not a partner. she doesn\u2019t ask about how i feel or seems interested in sharing a life w me. i feel very suffocating & burdening. she thinks that me asking for reassurance is repetition & asking for communication means talking about things that don\u2019t need to be talked about. she\u2019s not romantic towards me anymore and probably hasn\u2019t been since i moved here; we haven\u2019t had s*x in about 3-4 months and i feel like she\u2019s just not interested in our marriage anymore. also feels like me wanting to have my accomplishments celebrated is absurd & just being celebrated in general is stupid and childish. \n\ni gave up a lot because i felt like she would be my safe space and ended up risking & losing it all to gain nothing. currently im just home, while she\u2019s away for who knows how long (military stuff) and the few times we been able to talk it doesn\u2019t seem to bother her that we are away from each other; she rarely even tells me she loves me. i see all these amazing couples that their s.o. is so detail oriented and careful, respectful and just so in love & i see my relationship and i feel like im settling and it\u2019s not even bare minimum. i don\u2019t even feel like i have intimacy w my own partner and i have to be my own and her partner. \n\nTL;DR \nafter moving in with my wife she started being distant and kinda mentally abusing. she started making me less and less of a priority and i feel kinda stuck. i don\u2019t really have anything to fall back on as i left everything for us to be physically together. she doesn\u2019t seem interested in fixing our relationship but i don\u2019t think she wants to admit it. \n\nwhat would you advise for me to do? should i just work on my own stuff & then ask for a divorce when im in a better position or hope that she\u2019ll notice that we\u2019ve been in the trenches for far too long and fix things?

Nope you need to control what you can control and that is yourself.  I would encourage you to keep going to individual therapy and check out Marriage Helper on the PIES of Attraction because you can be happy in a bad marriage by taking care of yourself, even if that means buying toys and getting your own job.  I would specially look into going back to school while marriaged in the military because you might be able to get some good certificates that can get you good jobs which if things don't work out then you will be okay.  So Marriage Helper PIES of Attraction and also check out Gottman 4 Horsemen, sounds like you two are fighting with those bad boys which makes fights last on and on and on and thus breaking the trust (whats left) down.  \n\nSo to me it sounds more like broken people got married and not a broken marriage and if you two got the help you two needed you can make it through this but it would require you both do the work.  I assume there is a lot of grieving and pain going on with her with her ex cheating on her like that and you also have some pains with one failed future marriage.  So address these things because they are the archors in your relationship that is sinking the ship.  \n\nAs for comparing your marriage, please never ever compare yourself to other military marriages because to be honest behind closed doors they are messed up.  People cheating, partner swaping, only fan couples, addictions, all different kind of stuff and at all ranks, the military is full of people who know how to smile in public and hate themselves in private.  So don't let comparison rob you of joy, which is just another form of creating resentment.  \n\nHave you sat down with your wife and asked her what she wants the marriage to look like, what does she want it to feel like, what does she want her house to feel like?  \n\nAlso tools to help with your next counseling session, both of you take ACEs test, personality test, attachement style test, and BDSM quiz.  \n\nI hope you two make it through this rough path.",

I can absolutely admit that, but to me that seems like it's more his problem than mine. I can't understand why that doesn't want to make him step up so I do need him.

        "text": "As per title. Any examples or experiences would help me determine patterns of potential manipulation in my own marriage\n\nTL;DR I feel that some things my wife says about my family are manipulation tactics to get me against them or she's really just overanalyzing words and just bad at interpreting people's comments. \n\nEdit 1: caveat: this is probably gonna be petty. sister and her were sitting at the back of the car with my mom. My mom made a comment at my sister saying for her make sure her weight doesn't go on my wife since I kinda drive fast and do fast turns. My sister became quiet and stopped talking and my wife said that she tried talking to my sister twice and she ignored her. But then whenever I spoke, my sister responded. When we were going to get out of the car, my wife held the door on her side as my mom was sitting on the opposite side and was taking time to come out of the car, so my wife waited with the door on her side held opened and my sister apparently ignored her (I don't know if she noticed or if more of her was on my mom's side to get out from there) and this happened twice in the same day, and my sister wasn't talking much until everyone noticed and asked her. She then started talking more and claimed she was having cramps and then went to get a medicine from her bag in my car. My wife doesn't believe that my sister's pain suddenly went away and doesn't believe my sister when she said she didn't ignore my wife. My wife claims that my sis doesn't like it if she isn't involved in an inside joke between mom and her because she always asks on a suspicious way that what's being laughed about, and why she isn't part of it etc.\n\nThere are other things where my wife feels my sis didn't do certain things before, and when my sister sees my wife doing that thing, she doesn't acknowledge it, just starts doing it without saying she got reminded of it or inspired through my wife, becomes competitive. For example, wrapping gifts. My wife asked me if my sis ever wrapped gifts before and that she has never seen my sis wrapping gifts after I married my wife but only started doing it when she saw my wife doing it for my parents, she starts doing it. Tbh my sis did wrap here and there before as well. Idk if my wife is manipulating certain details to get me to think bad things about my sis\n\n\n\nApologies in advance for the pettiness in these stories",

They'll get over it your sister will get over it if it bothers your sister too much telll her to move back with them w her husband and kids and she'll be quick to say no. She'll get over it too. And if not then just continue to maintain a relationship w them all.  Remind her that you want privacy and want your bond with your wife to grow and love deepened.\nMy advice move out.

He insisted he doesn't know and lied straight to my face that he just copied pasted it. I didn't buy it. It's a straight lie. I was not born yesterday. He said he didn't upload photos, but in fact he has 4 photos, another lie.\n\nI asked him the reason why he created that profile. He  gave back the question to me confidently \"why do you think I did that?\" he said.\n\nHe admitted that he created a profile because he is sexually deprived!\n\nI am 3 mos. postparturm, had an emergency CS. Our baby is only 3 mos. old. He never spoke about sex with me. When I was pregnant, I was open of having sex but he refused thinking about the baby's safety (fair enough). \nI tried to be intimate but I felt most of the time that he's not interested.\n\nCouple of times I opened up and ask him what does he think is the problem, he said he had no idea. \n\nI understood that his father just passed away and he got severely sick too. Maybe that's the reason why, I was convincing myself. \n\nIt's been 3 mos. postpartum and lately, I feel sex deprived too, I masturbate sometimes when I'm alone. Actually even when I was pregnant, I did. But I am trying to understand the situation and believe that it is just a phase in our relationship.\n\nI thought we were okay. I have never felt any interest from him though. I felt unwanted most of the time because I am fat, I have stretch marks, I sometimes not able to take shower, I snore loudly (as he always points out) and I was told that I am boring. \nI thought, it's okay! maybe.... I am really unattractive right now. \n\nAt times, I'll be happy with random cuddles, hugs and kisses. Some random compliments that I'm pretty would make me smile.\n\nI am very open to communicate about sex and I am always willing to try to come up with solutions. I've never expected that my husband will choose to be on Tinder even it can potentially damage our marriage.\n\nNow, I can't avoid to think, what if I never caught his hidden Tinder profile. God knows. He might just continue using it, start flirting with someone and end up having an affair. Possibilities! He knew this even before creating his profile for sure but he still chose to do it.\n\nHe said he never meet someone. I am trying my best to trust and believe. He said, he never lied to me. I think maybe never, not until I came to know what he's hiding.\n\nHe said he made a mistake and he is sorry and this will never happen again. I feel numb. I don't know how to take it. I feel like an idiot. Trying to be the best wife! Little did I know, my husband is starting to be unfaithful because we were not having sex!\nMy husband is looking for someone to satisfy his sexual needs on Tinder!\n\nIt scares me. How a person can be betrayed, stabbed behind her back inspite of loving and taking care of her husband.\n\nI just want a happy and peaceful family life, but this situation is making me feel that maybe I am asking too much. It makes me question myself, maybe I am not good enough. Maybe I have done something wrong. Maybe I am the problem.\n\nTL;DR: I don't have my parents anymore and some of my relatives whom I thought I could count on left me and now, my husband, my love, whom I thought I could lean on, may safe space, somehow chose to betray me.\n\nIt's a cruel world indeed.\n",

It takes a lot of maturity to sacrifice, provide, and protect when one is receiving less attention than before. For men who are emotionally immature, this time is like navigating a field with landmines. It's a huge percentage of cheating posts that have the words pregnant or postpartum in them. While it may seem like they're all just born philanderers, I would bet that it's due to hurt feelings and lack of validation that leads to resentment. Add 24/7/365 access to porn, dating apps, OF, etc ...\nTo be clear, cheating is a choice.\n\nThis is obviously terrible for mothers who deserve more care and provision, not betrayal, at such a vulnerable and special time.\n\nI feel like men are in a crisis as many of us were raised by emotionally immature fathers, uncles, grandfathers and there isn't much in the public discourse about how to be ready to be a father. There's some basic stuff that sounds good like I will love my child. But that is the barest of minimums and can in theory be done from 3 states away. How will we prepare to sacrifice? To put her/them first (even when snoring etc) To be present and engaged in household tasks and share the mental load?\n\nIf men can't do these things, then women aren't going to have much use for marriage.",

I took a lot of offense to this and freaked out on him for not being into me because I had a different body. Not much came from that conversation, Im just saying it's ok to be upset that your husband wasn't into you during your pregnancy. Now that I've had a baby, i also FEEL fat and gained some weight, but it will go away. My husband tells me I still look hot. Whether he means it or not, it is supportive mentally, and you should have the same support. The fact that you just had a baby makes it disgusting for him to be on apps like that. Also, it's really challenging because what do you do? You just had a child with him, and you were expecting a family, but you find one of the more gross dating apps on his phone. If you have another place to go, I would make arrangements to stay there for a while to decide what to do. If he's cheating like this already and while you were pregnant than its most likely he'll keep on doing it, and that's not what you need right now or ever. You need love and support, a place where you don't have to worry about being cheated on in your face. Or if you're not sure, think about an open relationship. Either way, he doesn't sound like a good guy and definitely not a good dad for putting you in this position when you're just surviving through the newborn phase. Also, I went through this with my first son, and because I was so upset all the time and consumed by my partners failures to be a good guy, I missed out on my sons whole early life. I hugely regret missing his baby hood and early childhood, and I will never get that time back. You dont want to go through those emotions because it's really sad and hard to swallow. Don't let this guy rob you of some of the most precious times of you and your baby's life. Find a place to stay, and give him a sit-down conversation about what he's doing to you emotionally and physically. Get out of there and look for an apartment. It will be hard but easier in the long run.",

I butt heads with my MIL and FIL often because of the ways they want to involved in our day to day life (they live very close by) that truly are bewildering to me because it just so different from how I would expect family to support each other. Some examples: MIL wants to know all the details about our 7yo activities not necessarily to help us manage them but so that she can decide for us whether the activities should continue. She almost never thinks it should and will send long text messages and bring it up every time we are in person to lay out why and what changes we should make. FIL is always pressuring me to go back to school to get degrees I have no interest in and gives me career advice when he thinks I work in a field I don\u2019t actually work in. It\u2019s near daily conversations. If it weren\u2019t that consistent I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t be as bothered by it. \n\nIt results in me telling them as little as possible about our lives as I can, a tactic I now recognize my husband is incredibly good at. My husband and his two siblings are nearing their 50s and from my observations have struggled to feel a strong sense of self because their parents have always controlled so many aspects of their life. This has lead to me often getting so frustrated with our marriage and relationship that I have to ask my husband if he even knows who he is, because he always does what they tell him to do, from the littlest to the biggest parts of his life. I ache for him. I know we expect different things because of the vast difference in the ways we were raised. But I\u2019m feeling exhausted by it. \n\nTL;DR Does anyone have experience with this difference in control within family cultures? How have you learned to manage it? ",

        "text": "The other day my husband(28m) and I(28f) had attended his sister\u2019s graduation. Afterwards we had went to pick up some food from a few places as we were planning on going back to my in-laws house to celebrate her amazing achievement. Ok no problem.\n\nNow, we are parents to a 2.5 year old and a 3 month old. My 2.5 year old has been dealing with a bit of congestion for the past few days and ended up puking on herself in her car seat from a coughing fit while my husband was inside a carry out story trying to get food. Naturally I call him to tell him what happened and that we needed to take her home quickly to clean her up. Who wants to sit in their puke?\n\nOfc he agreed and decided to stop at a store after this carry out place real quickly as it was on the way back to the house. Then the last place we stopped to gather more food was literally walking distance from our house. It was a bar/corner store/carry out type of gig. They told my husband that it was gonna be a little while for the food to be done so he told me to go to the house to take care of the kids and that he would call when he was ready. Ok cool.\n\nI leave. I get home and i begin trying to quickly take care of kids. My 3 month old is crying as his diaper needed changed and he wanted to breastfeed. My 2.5 year old is upset because she\u2019s now hungry and wasn\u2019t thrilled about taking a quick shower. During this chaos my husband apparently is calling me saying he\u2019s ready to be picked up. I missed his first few calls because my phone is on silent mode and because I was tending to the kids. He gets pissy because I didn\u2019t answer the phone when he called the first couple of times, and that I wasn\u2019t moving quick enough essentially and that I was \u201cdragging\u201d my feet. I ended up hanging up on him because I couldn\u2019t deal with the stress of everybody needing me at once. I quickly shower my toddler, dress her then sit down to nurse my 3 month old for a few minutes while browsing my phone before trying to pack the kids back into the car to get my husband.\n \nWell he ends up walking back to the house and sees me sitting on the couch on my phone while nursing our son and proceeds to immediately start arguing with me. He says I was sitting on the couch doing nothing, and that I had abandoned him at the store. I was taking too long to come get him(It took me 30 minutes to take care of the kids). He has told me he had decided to wait outside(it was a rainy day) instead of inside the bar for me because he was uncomfortable being around drunks. He said that I should\u2019ve just wiped our daughter off and changed her clothes instead of bathing her as it wasn\u2019t necessary and he insinuated that I was making the day about myself when it was a special day for his sister(that pissed me off to no end but okay). He says I always play the victim.\n\nAn argument follows. He takes my son telling me that we need to leave to his family\u2019s house. I will admit I started yelling at him telling him no I don\u2019t want to go now, he can go with the kids by himself. He grabs my arm preventing me from walking from him. Eventually I did then tried to escape to our room but he wouldn\u2019t let me shut the door. I kept refusing to go with him to the event. All this happened in front of our kids which I feel badly about. Then once he saw I kept refusing. He finally grew calmer and still insisted we leave. As pissed off as I was I finally gave up and we left.\n\nNaturally when we arrived, his family could tell I was not in a good mood and started asking me what\u2019s wrong. I didn\u2019t want to vent to them or make the occasion about myself obviously so I just told them I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. It was so hard for me to not kill the mood but I tried to be as pleasant as possible even though I really didn\u2019t want to be bothered. My husband is acting normally and ended up talking until a little past midnight. We leave and then he proceeds to act like nothing happened and wanted to talk my ear off.\n\nThe next day I tried talking to him about what happened and that got heated as well.  He says that what happened yesterday was entirely my fault and that i always play the victim. He said he doesn\u2019t remember grabbing my arm and he concluded that I\u2019m a narcissist as I don\u2019t want to take accountability for what happened and that I always play the victim. I told him that physically preventing me from walking away from him was a deal breaker and he basically said he didn\u2019t care and that I could leave him if I want. \n\nIdk how to move past this besides pretending that we\u2019re cool again as leaving him is obviously not the easy or quick solution. This is not his first offense for physically not allowing me to leave the situation and thinks it\u2019s ok because in his words I act crazy sometimes. My husband has seemed to have entirely moved on and is acting like nothing happened once again. Should i just agree to disagree as I\u2019m just making myself miserable at this point replaying it all in my head over and over but obviously this is letting him know that he can treat me however he wants. Idk what to do. Starting to think standing up for myself is a waste of time and energy because he doesn\u2019t care and knows that me leaving him is not possible right now.\n\nTl;dr: husband is angry that I abandoned him at the store in the rain on an important day for his sister and that I\u2019m essentially a narcissist because I refuse to tell him that I was wrong for leaving him stranded while not moving fast enough to tend to our kids. He thinks I did it intentionally. Should I just agree to disagree and act like nothing happened like he is doing?\n",

Ultimately your kids care is going to come first. 100% shower after vomiting all over yourself is the right thing to do and to me it sounds like you handled a vomit covered toddler and a new born like a boss while he just sat and waited on food. He's the adult your children are at helpless hard ages. He needs to get over himself. He's already told you everything you need to know about where he views you in your relationship and you shouldn't brush that under the rug and pretend everything is okay just because he doesn't want to be accountable for his behavior. He should absolutely know that things aren't okay and nor are they going to be until you two are able to talk and work things out and resolve your issues. \n\nThere isn't an easy out here. I get where you're coming from in that leaving isn't an easy or fast option but seeing as how this exact behavior also happened 2 years ago and who knows how much similar in between. You both have a lot to probably work through and you probably should be looking at all of your options and preparing for them in the meantime. Don't give him the easy out of brushing this under the rugs. Treat him with the caution he's made clear that you should.",

We\u2019re sitting on the couch and he asks me if I like surprises, I say not really, and he goes \u201cthe flowers I got you were a surprise, so I\u2019ll just go return them\u201d I of course don\u2019t like that joke and ask him if he thought that comment was necessary. Boom. Things blow up, he tells me I\u2019m being dramatic. I have issues. He\u2019s so fed up with my childish behavior. Tells me to shut the fuck up when I tell him his role in blowing this up is childish. He goes upstairs and tells me to leave him \u201cthe fuck alone\u201d. I go upstairs after 20mins to apologize for my end of things, of being in a funk. He lectures me on me being a child and not handling things like an adult. I cry. He blows up and cusses more. And tries to leave the house and keeps saying how miserable this marriage is. Am I an idiot for staying? We have no kids, split our mortgage. Married for 6 months\u2026 he does therapy but I don\u2019t see where it\u2019s helped him.

We never fought when we were long distance. Because it was 3 weeks together, every three months. The last time was 6 months apart. When I moved here. It was bliss for about a month then we started learning how to live together. We\u2019ve had many arguments and some fights. But never once, did either of us call each other names and tell each other to \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t put up with that shit. We have our moments, but we are respectful and work through it together, even if we\u2019re pissed at each other. Name calling is never okay. Speaking to your wife or husband that way is not okay. Part of having a successful marriage is all the good stuff, love, sex, best friends, etc. But it also involves knowing how to fight and have arguments with each other. Knowing how the other person deals with those moments. (I only know from watching my parents for 32 years, and had a very good upbringing with wonderful parents who always worked together even through the tough times) \n\nI was married once\u2019s before and I can tell you, he didn\u2019t know how to fight well. He was horrible and we lasted 6 months because I wasn\u2019t going to put up with that crap. My life is too precious and valuable to be treated like shit. This marriage now, we work together through everything, respectfully. We\u2019ve had one bad fight, that lasted weeks honestly. But we always treated each other with love and understanding. \n\nSo yeah, if it\u2019s already like this. This is how he fights, and it\u2019s dirty. I would be careful and re-evaluate what you want out of life and if you deserve to put up with someone who is okay with putting you down when he\u2019s upset. That tells a lot about a person.",

Unfortunately they had to learn to manage being around him when he blows up. I was single for 7 years and remarried and sadly I was fooled by my new husband and got me another narcissist. It\u2019s only been a year being married to my new husband and I can say I learned not to waste time this time around hoping he will change and for things to get better. I wasted 13 years with my first husband, I will not do that again. I know it\u2019s easier said than done to leave someone you love. So I would say give yourself a timeframe, if he doesn\u2019t do better that\u2019s your time to leave. Don\u2019t waste years like I did. I pray for these men.

Couple's counseling maybe?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't think he should be \"blowing up\" over little things like he is. That seems strange. Could it be the way you talk to him? Could you be coming off as accusatory maybe? Or idk, maybe using words that make it seem like he's a fault? And that could be why he's acting the way he is? I'm not saying you are. Just trying to have you be a little mindful of the way you talk to him if that could be the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr maybe he just doesn't know how to handle conflict or different perspectives.

If it wasn\u2019t for our child, we would not still be together. He is not a bad man. He treats me well. He\u2019s a great father. But I have no romantic feelings for him. Sex has never been great, but I loved him. I have zero interest in having sex with him. \nWe don\u2019t have many hobbies in common, and I noticed recently that I  gave up on my hobbies, because he didn\u2019t like them. That\u2019s LAME!\nAnyway, I don\u2019t want to get divorce. I have older children that have a lot of trauma from me splitting up with their Dad. I don\u2019t want that for our son. He\u2019s still so young. \nBut I feel like I need to communicate my feelings. It\u2019s not fair to him, for me to pretend. \nI know it sounds crazy, but I don\u2019t want to get divorced, and I don\u2019t want him to move out. Ideally, he would sleep in his room (we have 2 extra rooms) and we could co-parent our child. That\u2019s pretty much what we have been doing anyway. \nI guess I\u2019m just looking for advice on how to navigate this. \nTL;DR I don\u2019t love my husband but don\u2019t want a divorce. \n\nEdit to add: I received several comments assuming that I want him to take care of me, financially. That is VERY far from the truth. I work full time, and I make triple what my husband makes. Neither of us are worried about money. I don\u2019t want anything that isn\u2019t mine, and he doesn\u2019t want anything that isn\u2019t his. \nAlso, I plan on giving him a choice. I have zero intentions of not telling him how I feel. I\u2019m just not sure how to go about it.",

                                "body": "A commitment is there regardless of how you feel.  I'll use the example of your child.  You don't always feel like waking up in the middle of the night to feed him.  I don't know if your kid is a boy.  I'm just using a placeholder.  You don't always feel like changing his diaper.  You certainly won't feel like dealing with the tantrums as he gets older.  We don't feel like taking care of our kids all the time.  But we do it anyway because that is what a good parent does.  You don't stop being a parent just because it stops being a joy and feels more like enslavement.  We have a commitment to our children.\n\n  \nNow while you are not biologically obligated to your spouse, you did make a commitment.  You made vows.  That doesn't go away because you no longer like them.  That doesn't go away because you are no longer \"happy\".  Happy goes away.  Happy is very fleeting.  It's been my observation and that of others that most couples have about 18-24 months before feeling \"in love\" goes away.  Normal life sets in.  The passion goes away.  Your spouse isn't as attractive because now you've seen them every day in nearly every shape.  That doesn't change the fact that you made a vow and a commitment.  \n\n\n\nLove is more than a feeling.  It is an act.  I love my wife.  I love her when we are having phenomenal sex.  I love her when we are not.  I love her when she's yelling at our kids.  I love her when she puts Mary Poppins to shame.  I love her when she done up for a photoshoot.  I love her when she's sick and looks like death.  It doesn't change the way I treat her because she is my wife on the days I like her and the days I don't.  She has been my \"ride or die\" since before we said, \"I do\".\n\n  \nShe is my wife, which means I put her before everyone.  She comes before my kids.  She comes before me.  This only works because she puts me first, before everyone.  This means that when she starts talking, I stop what I'm doing and listen regardless of how little I care or how important my current task is.  This means that I take care of finances so she doesn't have to.  And yes this means that she will have enthusiastic sex whether she feels like it or not.  And often times usually that's what gets her in the mood.  She does it because she's my wife and that's how I need to feel taken care of.  Just like I cuddle with her because she's my wife and that's how she feels loved.  \n\n  \nAt the end of the day it's about putting your spouse first and giving them what they need.  It's loving them in the way they need you to.  And it doesn't matter is you don't want to at the moment.  They are your spouse and they are more important than your feelings.  Just like you are their spouse and you are more important than their feelings.  I think that's the final point I'm trying to drive at.",

I made a deal with her openly that we stay a family unit and raise our children and we can do whatever we want outside the house but we provide a loving and peaceful environment for the kids.  We do this until the kids are 18 and then we can go our separate ways.  We never introduce every single boyfriend or girlfriend to our kids, that we can be a family without us having sex.  I lived in a house like that as a child and I can say without a shadow of a doubt, kids DO NOT CARE who their parents are having sex with.  They just want peace and a loving environment for them and dont want to see a parade of sexual partners being thrown in their face.  So i did my part of the deal. I was a good friend to her because I love her and I only separated from her because she had no interest in me at all. Never held my hand, never hugged me, never sat next to me on couch, slept in separate rooms for 7 years, sex for me felt like I was forcing her.  I begged her to change how she treated me or just leave me but she did neither. So i felt like a wallet, nothing more, so that is what I gave her. I took care of her financially and was her friend and a dad for my kids.  \n\nFast forward to 10 years later, she accumulated 6 Louis Vuttons, gucci watches, drove a new car eveey 2 years, i paid for all that, all the bills. I can tell you that it was torture for me, being treated like my only worth was money and she took it for all these years was a bad feeling. I am not saying you feel that way about yoyr guy, but your child is young.  Let him go, i did exactly whar you did, and in the end she just abandoned our sons with just a year left before they are both gone.",

To give one what we couldn't give the others, a loving family. And to help blend the kiddos with a sibling they all share.\n\nSuper rough pregnancy, I noticed my wife would get out of bed in the night and sleep on the couch. So. Obviously seeing the woman I love carrying my child i started just sleeping on the couch so she could get rest. I thought it was a kind gesture but it never stopped. Anyway, cut to our daughter being born, hospitals still to our knowledge weren't accepting guests so we had sitters for the kids. The plan was 2 days home just us and the baby to get settled then have the kids back to meet their sister. We'll my wifes mother called up complaining about her son and daughter and said we have to get them. I say no problem you just rest and pump and call for whatever you need and I'll just get my son too and watch the kids. Should be fine right? Nope! For 2 years now she constantly tells me I chose my son over her, and that all I worry about are his feelings. Now to me it was important that all the kids great thier sister together as a family. \n\nFast forward and my son's mother (who is psycho) sends cops over at 11pm because I didn't answer when she called to talk to our son. Then she starts a bogus CPS investigation and really puts strain on my marriage. My wife said she didn't want my son over during the investigation to protect the other kids...which left me not seeing my son for almost 8 months I was a puddle for that period of time never having been so long apart. We started doing drugs and she would keep going to our daughter being born and then completely bashing my son IE retarded psychopath so on...\n\nSo we start to get better we start stopping the drugs, which I had a harder time with so one day she came home and could tell I'd done something which I lied and said no only lie I've ever told her. Well she kicked me out of the house and at this point I've been sober for over a month but she doesnt believe it even though ive taken tests. She barely speaks to me so i started reading on all the things i could do better, take her notes on my lunch. Sometimes even drop on off on the coffee before i got to work. Show up to keep the yard mowed for the kids. I even came over one night just to clean the kitchen. Well then i find out she has been doing everything she has been telling me to not do. I call her out on it and she says since you lied to me I've made it a point to lie to you...I dont know what to do anymore I definitely dont want to divorce but it seems that she has zero interest. \n\nTl;dR is my wife right have I been an ass? Do you think this is too far or can it be saved?",

We have a deep love and respect for one another. He is highly sensitive and I, like many women, feel unappreciated and overwhelmed with managing so much. We have 3 children together and both work full time. \n\nEmotional maturity is not my strong suit. I also struggle deeply with vulnerability. These issues coupled with his high sensitivity, anxiety and moderate depression aren't doing well together at the moment. \n\nWe've both done individual therapy. He does not want to do couples therapy because he thinks it'll be too painful and being up too many wounds for him. We are on the brink of separation. I do not want it. I think he doesn't want it but feels disillusioned in how I've listened to his needs. \n\nI'm now looking for resources. Is there a way for me to grow into vulnerability better as well as softening overall. I grew up with a single mother who was a narcissist and didn't model softness for me in anyway. \n\nPlease let me know any information or resources that may help.

Yes, you can absolutely grow in vulnerability. Individual therapy helps pinpoint why vulnerability is hard for you. Is it just you? Is there something about your relationship that compounds the fear of vulnerability? Figuring that out can be helpful. \n\nCouples therapy is what helped the most in trying to be vulnerable with my husband, although it's a big struggle for me. Having a third party to help pull you out of yourself, provide a safe space to be vulnerable, and be there to guide the conversation is incredibly helpful; it makes being vulnerable less scary.  It sounds like couples therapy would be a great option. It's better to get out all the painful stuff than to keep it inside. That definitely won't help with vulnerability.",

        "post-author": "Perplexed_Newt",
        "text": "  Please forgive the inevitably long post.  Me '31F' and my husband '30M' have been together 8 years, married 6. We have two kids together 6M and 4F. We've had a lot of problems together over the years, but this is a big one. My husband started talking to an old high school friend (29?F) about a year ago. She was in a tricky spot (in rehab, bad boyfriends, sick dad) and needed a friend and we were having issues. He said it helped him to talk to her about our problems. It made me uncomfortable. I know I can be insecure, and after a few fights and heart to hearts, I dropped it.\n   So around a year passes, he gets a better job an hour away and we plan a move. We find a house, start packing and moving small things over. I put my 2 week notice in at work, and wait for our kids to finish school.\n   I knew my husband kept in touch with her, but I thought it was like brief check-ins or something similar. \n   On my last day of work my husband sends me a message that says someone may be reaching out to me trying to incriminate him with screenshots of the girl and my husband's conversations. Turns out it's the girls new boyfriend who found the messages and wants payment to keep quiet.\n   I've gotten about 9 screenshots sent to me so far, and some direct messages that describe what the others screenshots will hypothetically contain. My husband has deleted all these conversations on every device.\n   I've read the screenshots, and it is indeed my husband using his work phone to send her messages. He called her babe, sugar tits (ew), and suggested she start an OF. He asked her what her sexual desires were. He tried to talk to her almost everyday. \n   As this information was trickling in, I begged him to just tell me everything and he would say \"I've told you everything!\" until the next screenshot came in and proved him wrong. He sent her money from our joint account, which digusts me, we struggle some weeks to afford necessities. They claim to have many more screenshots with a lot worse on them like plans to cheat, but I don't think it would be wise to believe them without proof. \n  The person sending me this stuff is clearly using and hoping my husband pays up to prevent more texts from being released. I don't think my husband has paid this man anything.\n I love my husband- he's been my best friend for so long but my heart is broken. He's always treated my boundaries like they were suggestions. He's hurt me, made me question everything, and I'm tired of always forgiving him. But, as of yesterday I'm unemployed and when I get another job in our new city I will not make enough to support my kids (not an exaggeration, I live in FL). I truly don't want to get a divorce, and I'll be looking for a therapist.\n     Am I blowing this out of proportion? Can couples come back from this? I would appreciate any input. Thank you.\n  TL;DR; My husband is being blackmailed by his 'old friends' new boyfriend. Screenshots I've read from the blackmailer show that my husband has had an emotional affair and has lied about it.",

        "text": "Looking for advice.  I\u2019m a 59 yo female, married to my 60 yo husband for 9 years.  We married when we were both 50, my second marriage, his first.  He\u2019s a good guy and we get along well.\n \nMy dilemma now:  we don\u2019t have sex.  We had sex for the first 3 years of our marriage, but now it\u2019s off the table.  He feels bad that he can\u2019t fulfill my needs.  But I\u2019ve accepted it.\n \nWe recently discussed the possibility of me seeking sex outside of our marriage.  He didn\u2019t like the idea at first, but understood about my needs not being met.  Basically, he has now consented to me seeking sex outside of our marriage.\n \nI\u2019m not sure where to start looking for an intimate encounter.  I\u2019ve heard about an app called FWB (Friends With Benefits).  There\u2019s also Bumble and Hinge.  Is it even worth it to go out seeking?  Safety is a big issue!  With fake accounts/bots, catfishing and who knows what else.\n \nAny advice is appreciated. \n\nTL;DR at my age (59), and given my current circumstances,is it a good idea to seek sex outside my marriage?\n\nAlso please note: my husband is a long time vape/THC smoker, which has killed his libido; furthermore he has bad anxiety. Both of these have resulted in no longer having physical intimacy ",

                "body": "I\u2019m going to recommend you don\u2019t. \n\nHe needs to see a doctor. He likely has low testosterone and that\u2019s an easy fix. He could get on Clomid (a once a day pill) that sparks your body to produce testosterone. He could use a topical cream. He could do injections. \n\nFixing low testosterone will fix a lot of things. Low T causes depression, weight gain, loss of muscle, fatigue, poor sleep, brain fog, and compromised immune systems. \n\nHe might have depression. That\u2019s something many men have and they rarely get it diagnosed. It could be from low t or pther factors.\n\nIf he has ED, that\u2019s also an easy fix. He could take a once a day Cialis, and/or he could take Viagra. There\u2019s a couple of other solutions available.\n\nSolving those problems could solve the dead bedroom problem.\n\nI agree with the other comments that you\u2019re gonna be kicking him while he is down. He is not enthusiastically and willingly accepting this arrangement. He\u2019s desperate to make you happy and to keep you. If you really care about him, you\u2019ll explore other options that don\u2019t involve bringing others into your bedroom. \n\nOthers have raised this point but you cannot separate sex from feelings. It\u2019s really risky. What happens when people go outside the marriage is they get caught up in the new relationship energy (NRE.) NRE will bring you closer to the outsider and cause you to resent and negatively compare your husband to your new partner. Of course he will be devastated and his confidence crushed. This will make you even less attracted to him.\n\nSTIs are a given when you sleep around. How would you feel if you caught one, especially an incurable one? \n\nI certainly would not tolerate a dead bedroom. I would tell my partner that they need to work together to solve it. There are plenty of things that you can do. Solo masturbation is never a substitute for sex, but mutual masturbation or even him playing with you does bring you together. He can wear a strap-on. He could use a dildo or vibrator on you. Lots of options.\n\nI strongly encourage you to NOT open it up!",

        "text": "My husband (35M) is not interested in doing anything I want (35F)We\u2019re going through a rough patch lately and I feel like I\u2019m starting to realize it\u2019s always been about him and what he wants. If I drag him along to do something that I want or enjoy that he DOES NOT want to do he will complain by suddenly feeling sick or tired or will sit there with an RBF the entire time. We\u2019ve been together 15 years married for half of that and I feel like subconsciously I\u2019ve always catered and adapted to the things he wants and neglected the things that I like. For example, we have a free weekend and he\u2019s chosen to go with his friends instead of prioritizing making our garden which I\u2019ve been asking for for over a month. He spent last Saturday with his friends I would think he\u2019d spend this one with me doing something I\u2019ve wanted to do. Another thing is he will never accompany me to any shopping whether it\u2019s for myself, a gift for a party we\u2019ve been invited to, even grocery shopping. But the other day he realized he wanted to buy himself something that requires going to the mall and he\u2019s like hey let\u2019s go and I told him for weeks I\u2019ve been telling you I want to go to the outlets or the galleria and you completely ignore me about it but since there\u2019s something YOU WANT now you want to go? Whole time I\u2019m telling him this he\u2019s scrolling on his phone completely disregarding what I\u2019m saying and he\u2019s speaking out loud \u2018oh man this mall doesn\u2019t have them I wonder what about X Mall\u2019. It\u2019s like talking to a wall.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m starting to realize that it\u2019s ALWAYS been like this and it\u2019s almost like something in me has snapped and now I\u2019m realizing that I don\u2019t even know what I truly like or enjoy. I\u2019ve always supported him and accompanied him in everything he\u2019s ever wanted to do and a part of me feels like why can\u2019t I receive the same support in return? So now I\u2019m prioritizing myself by trying new things with or without him. I just fear this is going to grow apart.\n\n\nTl;dr \nHusbands not interested in anything I like. I\u2019m realizing it\u2019s been this way our entire relationship. ",

                "body": "One of the challenges for couples who got together very young is that they often haven't fully discovered themselves, or each other, yet. At that age, you\u2019re still figuring things out. Over time, it\u2019s also easy to grow complacent and start taking each other for granted. There are also plenty of people I spent time with in my early 20s that I wouldn't even consider being with today. \n\nPersonally, I genuinely enjoy spending time with my partner. I even go shopping with her, yes, even grocery shopping, which I usually can't stand. Just last week, we planted a garden together. These shared experiences matter.\n\nIf I had any advice, it would be this: go out and do the things that make you happy. \n\nDon\u2019t force your partner to come along. If you invite him and he\u2019s not interested, just say, \u201c*Alright, I\u2019ll see you later, I\u2019m going to [wherever you\u2019re going]*\". That does two things, it allows you to live your life fully instead of waiting around and getting resentful, and it also sends a quiet but clear message. It signals that something is shifting.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the truth, if he truly loves you, he\u2019ll notice that change. \n\nHe\u2019ll start to reflect, worry, and hopefully realize that if he keeps neglecting your needs and taking you for granted, he might lose you. Because the reality is, there *are* people out there who not only enjoy the things you do, but who enjoy doing them *with you* simply because they value your time and presence.",

Growing apart is real, painful and a lonely experience. However, I agree with u/Minute-System3441 in inviting your partner to join and enjoying the experience solo. This can give you time to discover new things about yourself and what the future can look like. \n\nWith that said, enjoying different things can also lead to rediscovering your partner and who they have become and vice versa. Many partners have a fulfilling relationship even though they don't enjoy the same things together. The caveat to this is understanding each other more fully and answering bids for attention and affection.\n\nAlso, I would not wait for him to notice that you are enjoying life without him, as he may actually believe that you are happy to do so and never realize how big of an issue it is. Take the time to find a relationship professional, whether that be a coach, counselor, or therapist. It's important to remember that statistically speaking men are least likely to seek help and don't realized how significant the problem is until they are in front of a neutral third party. \n\nWishing you the best, please keep us posted and join u/YourLesbianBFF to learn more from a woman who has played on both teams.",

(Excuse my spelling) and often times during our arguements or bitter moments he reflects the disrespect towards women in the videos towards me.. it\u2019s starting to become a big problem, because it just doesn\u2019t feel like he respects me as a woman anymore. I\u2019ve tried talking to him about it but he just doubles down on the comments the men have made towards women in the videos. I try to be a respectful wife to him, but I do have my limits as to what I feel is degrading, as I was raised in a household where the father shared the housework and my mother is more of a dominant figure in the family and he was raised in a traditional household where women do all the work around the house ect.

        "post-author": "lilquichemoney",
        "text": "My (32f) husband (36m) and I have been married for 5 years and he has always been terrible with money. His entire family is terrible with money. His mom, dad and all of his siblings carry massive amounts of debt and are stressing about finances constantly. He's one of 6 siblings and had no stability in his upbringing. He had lived in 15 houses by the time he graduated high schooI. Both of his parents divorced, remarried and divorced again. I, on the other hand, come from a family of 4 (one sibling), parents are still together and are financially very well off. I am good with finances and have always been financially responsible, and I have a good amount of savings as well as support from my parents if I ever needed it. I know I come from a place of privilege.\n\nJust over a year ago I found out that my husband had $18k in credit card debt and was hiding it from me. We've always kept our finances separate. It was a huge blowout and meltdown and we almost broke up over it. He talked to an advisor and sorted out a plan and promised to keep me in the loop on how everything was going. He was sending me screenshots of his progress and his bank accounts. He was also seeing a therapist regularly.\n\nTwo days ago I saw a gambling app on his phone. He tried to hide it. Turns out he's spent around $8k on sports betting over the last 5 or so years. Another fight ensues, he admits he has a problem. I tell him that the only way we're going to get through this is if he is 100% honest with me and lays EVERYTHING on the table, and that from now on I'm going to take control of all of his finances. I want to collect his checks and give him an allowance. I want his bank accounts on my phone and passwords to his emails. He agreed to this.\n\nWe sit down again and he says that he agrees to my terms but he needs to come clean about more stuff so it's all out in the open. Turns out, his debt is now HIGHER than it was last year, and he's been sending me PHOTOSHOPPED pictures of his bank statements all along. He now owes about $22k.\n\nI'm pretty sure the lying and deceit comes from a place of shame and embarrassment. I do think he probably has a problem with gambling - he's from Australia where he and all of his friends and family grew up betting on horses and sports and it's just snowballed from there. He also buys sports cards (to resell), lotto tickets, is in fantasy leagues online and with our friends, the list goes on. I am just really having a hard time coming to terms with being lied to. He's been crying and apologizing for days.\n\nAll of this aside, he's a terrific person and partner. He's my best friend. We laugh together constantly, he emotionally supports me through my issues, he's the first person to offer someone help when they need it. We cuddle, talk, go on dates, spend quality time together. My family loves him, all of our friends love him, I love him. He has a good job and is an incredibly hard worker, all of his employers and former employers love him. We've talked about having kids - I've seen how he is with his nieces and nephews and with our dog. He picks up my slack around the house - does all the dishes, laundry, will complete any task I ask him to. Walks the dog an hour a day. Buys me flowers, cooks me whatever meals I'm craving, will drop everything to go pick me up an ice cream if I feel like one.\n\nBut I just don't know how I can get past the deceit. He's shown me that he's willing to lie to my face until he's backed into a corner with no way out. My gut is telling me that he hasn't lied to me about other things and it's genuinely just the money and he's in over his head. But how am I supposed to trust him again? Am I supposed to just dig until I find dirt for the rest of our lives?\n\nHe's already called a gambling hotline and has set up a consult for counselling, and he has another appointment with his therapist on Monday. He's agreed to put his pride aside and let me handle all of his finances. I spoke to my mom about it last night and she told me that nobody's perfect and it could be worse, however she's PISSED at the betrayal and will support any decision I make. My dad is in finance and my husband has agreed to talk to him for guidance as well. We're in North America and his entire family is in Australia, my dad looks at him like a son.\n\nThe kicker - we never had a wedding because of COVID so we planned a \"wedding\"/family reunion for the end of June and a bunch of his family are flying in from Australia to be here. I'm not sure how to navigate this.\n\nI guess I'm here to ask - is this salvageable? I love him so much. He's got so many great attributes and I know that no one's perfect and everyone has their faults, but this one feels big.\n\nThanks for listening, felt good just to type this out.\n\nTl;dr: husband has been lying to me about his debt for years and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to get past it.",

You will grieve. Your husband has broken your trust in a significant way and it may feel like a loss, and it is okay that it does. It is okay to go through the range of emotions that come with this situation. \n\n2. Yes it is salvageable, if you both want it to be. This may look like a lot of transparency at first, in addition to professional help both independently and together. While it was his indiscretion it is a relationship problem.\n\n3. Be cautious is taking over the finances. Once you begin adding a \"parent-child\" dynamic to the relationship it can open you up to contempt, criticism, defensiveness, and stonewalling. This dynamic can be very difficult to change.\n\n4. Make sure that any professional you use is willing to help you co-create a roadmap to repair. We have all heard that actions speak louder than words and if you are seeking professional help, then you should also have action steps added to the conversations. There are professionals who may want to talk the situation to death, which can only exacerbate the issue. \n\n5. It may take more than one type of professional to help. For instance, you may find a trauma or affair professional is helpful at first, while a financial professional could be a good supplement to help you both gain a better understanding of the way you each view money, and how to build a shared vision about money together. \n\nI hope you find everyone's responses helpful.",

        "text": "I, 34m and wife 32F, have been married for 10 years, together for 13 years. Went to high school together but did not hang out or started dating until I came back from college. Have two kids under the age of five. It\u2019s been rough lately and I\u2019m worried of where our marriage is headed.\n\nI am the sole provider of the household, which I agreed upon after having our first child. She used to work but she wanted to be a stay at home mom and didn\u2019t want to just work to pay for daycare. My job can be very demanding. Some weeks or months I can be home by 5:30pm, other times I don\u2019t get home till midnight for multiple days. Called out as soon as I get home sometimes and out till early hours of the morning. My wife gets very very frustrated with my job because of this now. It took me almost 8 years to get this job. My job pays well and puts my family in a position to make ends meet plus some, along with really good health care and insurance. 401K and pension plans makes retirements with this company very nice. Which is what I was wanting to get to.\n\nWhen I am able to be home on time and not working weekends, I help clean the house, laundry, cook (by means of grilling foods) and bath the kiddos plus assist with bedtime routines when I can. I play with the kids and try to keep them entertained while she makes dinner most of the time. Yard work, and trying to develop our property when I am able. I do a lot of the automotive work on our vehicles and RV, which was bought ahead of time for the kiddos to go on camping trips and what not. \n\nBut it feels like it\u2019s never good enough\u2026I feel like she is always mad and frustrated at me. She tells me that she is lonely and misses me, overstimulated with the kids and when we can I take her out on a date out of town to change things up and we have fun. Shopping for the kids or taking her to Barnes & Noble, her favorite place. Dinner and back home. Granted a lot of our favorite past times is just cruising the highways together. Which we do! I alway try and flirt with her and compliment her on things to help boost her moods or let her know that she is my number one person. I try and let her know that I appreciate her staying home with the kids, making dinner and helping out with making sure the bills are paid. We talk about my job and what\u2019s going on there and I always ask her about her day, we talk about old friends and family, social media or news topics. We discuss and talk about books we are reading or listening to. If I have enough energy I\u2019ll play some old video games of mine to relax the last hour of the day away before going to bed while she listens to a book or asking me about the game I\u2019m playing. \n\nSex life is almost none existent at this point, which does frustrate me but doesn\u2019t stop me from loving her. Her love language is acts of service not physical contact, mine is physical contact. I have always told her that I\u2019ll never force her to have sex if she isn\u2019t in the mood because I want her to want it and her to be raw and in the moment with me. Maybe that is a thing of respect from me and me cherishing the act and physical contact with her. The sex has diminished some in my eyes, it\u2019s one position and her vibrator (which has never bugged me). We used to be all over each other and multiple positions. \n\nMost of the time now when we talk by text or phone calls, there is a negative feeling to it. She is always venting or saying she is frustrated because of our oldest acting out or being difficult. I get home from work and it\u2019s never a smile anymore when I see her it\u2019s a look of defeat. I always have to go and hug her or kiss her, she never comes to me. (Again she doesn\u2019t do much physical contact after having a hard day with the kids). We shower together most of the time which it\u2019s nice to scrub each others back or share some kisses and hugs. (It always leads to my arousal). If it doesn\u2019t seem like the day was too hard on her and she seems like she is in good spirits I may flirt and see if she may be interested in sex. Usually it\u2019s a \u201cI\u2019m pretty worn out, maybe tomorrow.\u201d So I drop it and try to move on to other things or conversations. Typically sex doesn\u2019t happen for months at a time now. \n\nI\u2019ve communicated with her that it\u2019s always me initiating or chasing her, never the other way around and asking her to possibly attempt it from now and then. I\u2019ve always told her that if she needs to get out of the house to have a breather she can when I am able to due to my job. \n\nIt\u2019s just I don\u2019t know what to do anymore, I feel like I\u2019m living with a roommate instead of my wife, like I\u2019m carrying the world for her and the kids. Like no matter how hard I try to tend to her needs or requests it\u2019s never good enough. I try so hard to keep my cool from my jobs stresses or me being exhausted from long hours of work or staying up with kids when I can to help her out so she gets some sleep or rest at night. I some times lose my cool and bark or have a snappy response to a question. Which at times I don\u2019t even notice it, I\u2019m just responding to the question with a direct answer. I\u2019m burning out and feel like I\u2019m putting everything into our relationship. I don\u2019t feel appreciated anymore at home except from my kids. I get more appreciation from work now. \n\nWHAT AM I DOING WRONG OR NOT DOING!? Need some advice or viewpoints.\n\nTL;DR: Lost, lonely and don\u2019t know where my marriage is headed.",

        "post-author": "Upper_Past_3537",
        "text": "This story is so incredibly long and detailed I've decided not to even try to encompass it in full narrative form. Instead, I'll try to share some facts about where I'm at and then describe my current heartache/dilemma.\n\n\\* She's 40, I'm 37\n\n\\* Married 4 years, known her 5 years\n\n\\* She's divorced with 3 children (at the time we met all elementary age)\n\n\\* I'm divorced with no children\n\n\\* I met her while she was in the midst of what ended up being a custody battle for her children that lasted more than 3 of the 5 years I've known her\n\n\\* Before we married we discussed having children of our own together. It's a big dream of mine. I'm a giant sucker for kids. I love her kids, I want my own kids, I play the making fun faces game with other people's kids in line at the grocery store, etc. She agreed, we married, and by the honeymoon we were talking about baby names. By the next year we were working to conceive.\n\n\\* Her custody case with her children, however, hung over our heads this entire time. Her ex husband continued to push courts for modified custody. His case was pretty strong. The fact that in the midst of the stress of that my wife had a suicidal episode, and then a few months later another one, did not help. We ended up having to settle that case in a way she is not pleased with. She is devastated. Went from 80% custody of her children to 50%.\n\n\\* I also was very affected, as I love her kids more than anything and had concerns about their well being in the other household. I felt sad for now having less time with these beautiful and vibrant children.\n\n\\* Her stress and instability during those times was so high she would say anything and everything to hurt someone around her..usually the safest person to take a swing at, which was me. I'm a pacifist. I don't yell, I don't shout, I don't slam doors, and I have never ever touched a woman in any hurtful manner. She knows this through and through, therefore I was the punching bag she knew wouldn't punch back. Some real damage was done, for which she has only partially accounted for. The fog of war, I guess.\n\n\\* It was during one of these rages she shouted at me \"you know I'm never having your child, right?\". I will have that moment in time burned into my brain like a photograph for the rest of my life. I can tell you right how she was standing in the door frame. Right where I was sitting. That the overhead light was on, which it often wasn't. I was destroyed. But I didn't yell or shout. I figured she probably didn't mean it.\n\n\\* Turns out she did. In the 2 years since then I have worked hard to figure out how to sort the difference between how much I wanted that vs how much I value standing by her and her kids' side regardless. In those 2 years, though it took a very long time, she has apologized for how heartless she was in delivering that message.\n\n\\* She has told me repeatedly since that I should leave her. That I should go find someone to make my dreams come true with. I've consistently replied that I love her, and her children, and I'm working through how not to go anywhere.\n\n\\* What I've had in the meantime, however, has not been her gratitude. It has been her total withdraw. She no longer will do activities with me if they aren't going out to eat or watching TV. She cancelled a week of vacation time I set aside for us to work on building a playroom for her children. She threw a tantrum in December where she \"uninvited\" me to her youngest son's piano recital and then ordered all the kids' christmas gifts without me...something we have always done together because she fully knows giving christmas gifts to people I love is one of my favorite things on the whole earth.\n\n\\* She has, since then, also begun repeating the phrase \"YOU left me\". She tells how much I hurt her by \"leaving\" her and her children. I just can't even come up with where this comes from, except for the one life change my counselor recommended I make which was to stop waking up at 6am to take her kids to school since I often work late nights and this was perhaps me giving too far in a relationship I wasn't receiving a lot back in.\n\n\\* Otherwise I have continued to be the breadwinner for her and the kids. I pay for our house, our food, our insurance. I pay to fly her to see me when I travel for work and buy plane tickets for her family members to come from out of state to see her. I have continued to spend immense time and energy supporting and parenting her children. But she just repeats \"you've left me\" or \"you've left the kids\".\n\n\\* I finally got a backbone and, after suggesting it for years, drew the line on marriage counseling. She tried for more than 6 weeks to dodge it. At one point when I brought it back up she said \"oh, I didn't know you still wanted to do that\". What? I was in no way unclear, and haven't been bringing it back up weekly to suddenly not want to do it anymore.\n\n\\* Eventually I got her to come in with me. We have a seemingly skilled doctorate level counselor that we both appear to respect. I got one session where I was permitted to voice my hurts, which was good. I shared it all, and the counselor got to hear it and she got to hear it. The counselor correctly identified that it sounds like there are hurts that need to be healed here.\n\n\\* The counselor asked me to present what would help me. I said my biggest issue is not actually the rug pull on having kids. It's that ever since whatever snapped where she won't have a child with me she refuses the concept of ANY future plans with me that were not her idea or solely to her benefit. I've tried saying can we plan somewhere to retire together, or plan a new project on our house together, or could I adopt a child and you step parent the way I step parent your kids so you don't have to disrupt your career. Could we find a way we meet each other in love and dreams. Something we dream together about? All of this she flatly just says no to. She just won't.\n\n\\* When the counselor asks her vision for our future, she says it's her doing her thing, me doing my thing, and she comes to visit me. As in like..even retiring to different states or something? All on my dime, of course, I assume? And when asked why, she says \"because he left me\".\n\n\\* Odd as this all is, relationships are not black and white. She does not seem to want me to go entirely. She initiated making love a few weeks ago. She calls me at work in the week when she's upset about something with her kids and I listen to her. We still share a care.\n\n\\* I still love her. I love her kids. I love her family. But I can not figure out where this on like a light switch one minute (usually when I could use some support), off light a light switch the next (often when she needs my support) rages will come from. I tried today in counseling with her to suggest at the beginning that we go ahead and turn a corner. That we let go all the past things and work on building a new and positive relationship here forward. Counselor wasn't opposed. She was. Much of the rest of the session was spent talking about how I don't apologize right. Much of the session before was spent talking about how I didn't give her the right advice last time she was upset about something with her children. Repeated through all of this is how I've \"left her\".\n\n  \n==\n\n  \nIf you've made it to this point, you're probably asking why the flying fuck I have not bowed out. The short answer; I feel stuck.\n\n\\* My friends, and my individual counselor I've engaged to help me with all of this, are a bit beside themselves that I have not left such a situation. They say it's common and respectable enough to go follow one's core dream of having a child, even if it wasn't in context of all this other nasty stuff. They say the other nasty stuff on its own could also be justifiably enough reason.\n\n\\* Thing is, I have a very hard time doing that to her kids, who have known me as the only example of a good and stable man in their life. How do we explain to them that now their little lives are getting upturned again because mommy and I can't hack it?\n\n\\* I have received supreme appreciation from her family, many of whom have privately gone well out of their way to profoundly thank me for taking care of their daughter/sister/etc after what she's gone through in the prior divorce. I take pride in this. I love being that for her. I love showing them that I am that. It makes me feel good. It brings me purpose. Or perhaps they've met her and know what I'm putting up with, and are profoundly thanking me for doing so? Hard to tell, but either way I love her family. They adore me.\n\n\\* And I love her. I care about her. I don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling guilty for leaving a woman alone with her 3 kids, especially a woman who has trouble with stability and taking care of them. I fear she'd lose the rest of her custody. I fear she'd take her own life. I fear I could never forgive myself.\n\n\\* I also think I mourn for how it once worked, and pine for it to perhaps work that way again. When we were new. When we did dream together. When we wanted things together. When we worked together to plan and then carried out those plans together as a team. There isn't any of that anymore. I still want it. She doesn't. I've begun seeing \"you left me\" as a projection. She left our dream of having a child. She wanted to leave this marriage and this life through suicide. She now has closed any door for future planning or dreaming together.\n\n  \n==\n\nTL;DR If I had a time machine, I wouldn't be in this marriage. But I am. And there are kids involved, kids that have been through a lot and are in a very precarious situation and at very impressionable ages. And I love her family, and they love me back even more. I don't want to let her down. I don't want to let her kids down. I don't want to let her family down. I don't want to let myself down. I don't know if my heart can make it.\n\nSo I'm faced with a choice. Stay, and find a way to come to grips with the new reality. Get some new hobbies. Have sex with her when she wants it (of all things that still usually works well for us, it's nice). And otherwise do what she's asking. That I just live my own life without any desire for or expectation of mid to long term planning made with her...and drift along.\n\nOR\n\nI leave, and go start again. A third time. It would be my second divorce. That feels pretty shitty. Talk about baggage. I do think there's a chance I could find a woman who is more wonderful to me. Who wants to dream of owning a house in the forest together, or a farm, or of a lifetime of travel. Of having and raising kids together. Of being a TEAM. But would I even enjoy such a thing with the guilt of having left a mentally ill wife and her three children and her very loving and appreciative family alone to have it?\n\nTo be clear, I'm not really asking for their sake. I'm asking for mine. Leaving is not really worth it if I'll just be kicked in my own ass the rest of my life by my own guilt.\n\n  \nI'm not looking for someone to take my side in this response. I'm looking for real talk. Tell me to buckle down. Tell me to get the fuck out. Tell me something I'm not thinking of. I don't need someone to tell me she's an asshole. I need someone to tell me which path hurts least. I can't take much more pain.\n\nThanks for your time, kind redditors of /marriageadvice",

I know this isn't what you want to hear, but it's probably best she doesn't have any more children. Who knows what the stress of pregnancy, childbirth, and an infant might do to her in her current condition.\n\nAre you in a jurisdiction where the children can choose their own custody arrangements anytime soon? Would they choose to stay with their mother, with or without you? I gather from your writing you don't think they would be better off in the care of their father, and unfortunately, I doubt you have any legal rights regarding them. How much longer before they'll be leaving home as adults? If both their parents were declared unfit, could / would you step in and take over them legally?\n\nIt seems you've thought of all the issues. You know you're in a toxic relationship that isn't likely to get better. You know the children need a reliable, loving, responsible parent, and you are apparently the only candidate. You also know that even if you stay, their mother could lose custody, and your sacrifice might be for naught but for whatever time they had with you. You know it's possible their mother could take them away, although that sounds highly unlikely.\n\nSo you're back to the question: leave to pursue your own dreams, or stay to do whatever you can for the children for as long as you can. Only you can decide if a new life with a new family might ease your  questions on whether or not leaving was the right thing to do. Only you can decide if you can effectively live in an uncertain hell in the hopes you'll be around the children long enough to see them safely off on their own. \n\nHopefully, you know there is no right or wrong decision here - the woman you married no longer exists, and the woman she is now may be incapable of ever being a loving partner again.\n\nIf you are spiritual, you might want to seek counsel of an elder of your faith. If you believe everything happens for a reason, you might consider if you were meant to have these children instead of additional biological ones. You should not feel badly about yourself whatever decision you make, though. It's a miracle you've stayed this long, and you are to be commended for it.\n\nI'm sorry I can't give you answers, just more questions. Whatever you decide, pls take care of yourself so that you can give yourself a version of the future you hoped for if / when the time comes.\n\nSending heartfelt concern for all of you ~",

She agreed at my insistence at the end of 2024 after a particularly bad episode of acting out to see her counselor weekly, something she had prior been resistant to. Her behavior has improved some since then, although I don't know if its because she scared herself with how indefensible that particular outburst was or if the regular help has brought some balance to her. Only a marginal improvement, but at least hasn't had a complete meltdown where all logic and self control exits the room.\n\nThat said, my attempts to get her help have apparently gained me no goodwill. Today in our marriage counseling she spent a good portion of the session accusing me of trying to diagnose her. When I calmly replied that I've never done any such thing, nor told her any label for any of this, and just want her to have whatever support she needs to feel happy she went off on quite a speech about how she says her counselor says my counselor says that I say she has xyz... which is either really unprofessional of her counselor, or is her spinning hard here. I can not imagine that her counselor asked my counselor what I think she has. How the hell would I know, anyway? I'm an engineer, not a doctor. I feel more lost on this stuff with her than any topic I ever have in my life. Point is..my efforts to get her to get help are both something she accepts, and happily has me pay for, but then uses as a weapon against me. Such are many things I do here. Given with love, accepted because she wouldnt otherwise have them, but then taken for granted at best and used against me at worst.\n\nThen this afternoon she's texting me photos of her daughter's soccer practice and saying she loves me.\n\nI'm not a doctor, but my heart has compassion for what does seem like some kind of imbalance? I just want her to be ok. And by extension for me to be ok. And I hate that right now the solution for me being ok is..distance. Even if still in the relationship, the amount of damage done to it seems such that it can't ever be like it was before. Or even if not like before, that it can't be wonderful again. I want it to be wonderful again. I need it to be wonderful again. I'm willing for it to be wonderful again. It's just hard for it to be when the person who has said the nastiest things about me that anyone ever has in my life, and who after all of that I've said I'll still stay with you and your kids, continues to need to tear me apart.\n\nExpectations root disappointment. I know I need to stop expecting I can find my happiness in someone who has been this way for the 5 years I've known her, and probably well before that. It just leaves me figuring out if I'll live a more lonely life of service to her while perhaps just spending time with friends or hobbies when I need connection or excitement, or if I should cut lose.\n\nShort of her punching me in the face, or hitting her kids (which she has never done), I can't imagine I have the heart to leave those kids alone. They already have had the most absurdly complex little lives I can imagine so far.\n\nOn the how old are they front, 5 years is a long time in the life of kiddos. One is now in high school, one in middle school, one at the top of elementary school. We have like 10 years of kids left. Which I don't mind conceptually. Again I love her kids. I'm more like..fearing the 10 years with her if she doesn't get better.\n\nBut some of it is because I do try to pine for it to. Maybe I need to just let go. Let be. Care for my wife in sickness and health and migrate my hopes and expectations to things she can't ruin.\n\nSorry for the long post. Half of the benefit here is me must typing and processing. Thank you again, kind random soul. You are a wonderful person.",

I don't regret it, but after they were gone, we separated for several years. During that time, we both worked on ourselves and eventually got back together, but I can't say it was easy. We both had to let go of the past and what we thought our lives would be like, accept it for what it was, and concentrate on the future.\n\nOn the individual counselors, I'd confront both of them. If your wife is fabricating statements supposedly made by them, she needs to be called on it. It's a good sign that she is in therapy. The right therapist should eventually be able to help her find and heal the pain that's causing her current difficulties. Try not to lose hope that it can happen unless the disappointment is too painful for you.\n\nTake care of yourself and understand that you are a wonderful person for your perseverance in loving them all ~",

One obviously gives their spouse benefit of doubt, and perhaps even has a duty to take their side on such things, but I will say that over the years my eyes have opened to the likelihood the situation was not exactly as she described it. I do think he's a man with less tasteful ways of managing his anger than I have. I hold myself to a very high standard for that. It's a core part of me. I've come to the impression that she likely provided the insane levels of frustration/noncooperation, and he provided the inappropriate response to his frustrations. As in, his frustration was likely understandable but his actions taken thereafter were not acceptable manners of handling it.\n\nSo yeah. I guess so, minus the threatening stuff?",

She actually pursued me with a message after I thought I\u2019d never talk to her again. We got married. We had twins that we held in our arms for one day then both died (IVF-my wife has a medical history). This happened 2 years ago. I\u2019ve never been the same since. We\u2019re together with a daughter now. But no sex. We tried after but I just couldn\u2019t. It felt weird and I was emotional and just not right. I can\u2019t have sex in that manner anymore. To be fair the sex wasn\u2019t great even before but I figured it\u2019s not about that. I also walk through life as a zombie sometimes due to my mental health. Our marriage is devoid of anything sexual or even relationship wise. We live together and share a house child and maybe a couple tv shows that\u2019s it. Idk if I have much of a drive but it\u2019s not nothing and my depression is so severe. Idk what to do I feel stuck and lost in this marriage. Not to mention the crippling mental health issues since childbirth from the immature 18 year old parents that didn\u2019t have a clue how to raise a child at all.

Sounds like from comments you are seeking out some therapy and I pray that starts to give you some healing and you can figure out what will help best to start getting back on the track of living LIFE!!  Your little girl- NEEDS you so much. Daddies are so valuable and vital, and you sound like you have the best heart- and behind the depression, there is a huge desire for more!! Hold onto hope for that.\n\nSo maybe don't put too much pressure on yourself for the sexual part of marriage...but intimacy is VITAL and doesn't always have to be sex. Start small. Hold hands. Cuddle. Flirt with each other. Do THINGS together. Even if it feels awkward at first...that can go away once you feel safe and allow your heart to trust.  Give massages. Allow yourself to feel loved by her. Allow yourself to love. I'm a person who can easily put walls up...and for you, that seems like what has happened?  Keeping yourself safe from any more hurt...it is so natural. What is the WORST that can happen if you allow yourself to be loved a little...at the end of the day you are already experiencing loneliness.   Sometimes we have to fight the feelings and just DO the actions...and feelings can come later?\n\nWhat is something that brings you joy? Music? Nature? Reading? Could you and your family try to do something together, maybe just for an hour or so a week...start small. No pressure...just do it?  Or get some of that time alone also to do something that brings a smile?  Laughing is vital...when was the last time you and your wife connected and just had a good laugh?? Maybe can't even remember that last time?\n\nPlease please give yourself a ton of grace too. You have been through so much. Everyone is so different in how they handle grief.  Sounds like you are getting some support- maybe even do that with your wife too? Have you sought out marriage counseling after the loss? Such a HUGE stress that you have endured.  Have you tried to find any community groups with people that have gone through loss?  Do you have any guy friends that are  wise and can offer up support and encouragement?  My hubby tries to be \"strong\" but he has had to lean on male friends in the past...and it is so valuable.  Your wife likely needs a support group of women around her.  As a former agnostic...and found my faith during the hardest time in my marriage....my faith changed EVERYTHING for me...and my marriage.   Do you have anything like that?",

Music speaks to me- and sometimes listening to lyrics that you can relate to can be helpful...but grab hold of that line.   I pray for a LIGHT to shine in your families life.  I am praying for you, my friend...that you will have a turn around.  I'm going to go Jesusy on you...but that is what CHANGED my life in my mid 30s (I was agnostic before that) . Jesus- gave me a JOY- didn't take all the hurt and pains away...but there was a joy in the midst of some of my hard stuff. A light was turned on for me.  I knew I was seen. I knew I was HEARD. I knew I wasn't alone. You aren't either. I pray you feel that...and listen...if you call out to HIM. HE HEARS you.  I did...and best decision I ever made.   Give yourself grace. Take your days minute by minute. Find something to be grateful for- love your wife anyways....find some support....pray- even if you don't believe!!",

        "text": "To cut the story short, my husband and I got married in October 2024 after 6 years of long distance (UK-US)\n\nThe plan was for him to move to the U.K. in September 2025. We have been talking about this plan for at least 1+ years. \n\nTragically, his parents passed away from health related causes in December 2024, which has thrust him into lengthy legal proceedings with:\nA) Trying to obtain their house for him and his 2 sisters (22 & 30) and\nB) Needs to start a conservatorship for his middle sister who is an adult but mentally ill and in need of full time care \n\nI have been very supportive during this process, but he\u2019s been adamant that September is still okay, he just needs to get a lot of the main, important legal bits sorted and can then manage the rest from afar (as a lot is done digitally nowadays). \n\nWith it only being 4 months away, he called me yesterday to say he is no longer able to come. Which I completely understand, even if it\u2019s overwhelming that we may have to do long distance for even longer. \n\nMy compromise was:\n- I\u2019ll wait here for as long as he needs to sort out what he has to do and he can join me when he\u2019s ready, with regular visits between\n- this means we can start to plan a family (I have great benefits from work, it\u2019s free in the U.K. and I have my community around me to help) \n- he can still manage a lot from a distance, but fly back when needed\n\nInstead, he wants me to:\n- apply for the US visa to join him in 1.5-2 years (I\u2019ll be 37 by then)\n- not be able to travel to him during that time \n- quit my job\n- sell my apartment \n- start a family in the US without any community or my own finances \n\nI know he\u2019s going through a hard time, but it feels really overwhelming for him to ask this of me, without considering what\u2019s best for our future family. He said I\u2019d regret choosing a job and apartment over my husband but it\u2019s not that\u2026its everything that comes with it \ud83d\ude14 Why would I want to raise a family in a tiny little back house in LA with no one around me, none of my own money, when we absolutely could do it here and \u2018have it all\u2019. \n\nAny advice would be so very appreciated. Thank you. \n\n\nTL;DR - Spouse is saying he can no longer join me in the UK in September. Am I wrong for asking him to stick to our plan and join me in the U.K. when he can? ",

You may have to compromise and move to LA even if it\u2019s not what you wanted to do, or you may have to decide that given the circumstances and the long distance and the timing that this isn\u2019t meant to be, which would suck, but I feel like you have to look at the bigger picture here",

I seriously do not want to get into it on the smell of that if trying to get intimate. \n\nHe\u2019s different than me and states that he\u2019s okay with doing things with me regardless if I\u2019ve showered or not but for me personally, I\u2019m not okay with it. \n\nHe gets upset a little when I say that as well. Just because he\u2019s okay with bodily odor doesn\u2019t mean I have to be right? But anyway this has been going on for years now. To top it off, he\u2019s quick if you know what I mean, and not the most well endowed. I truly don\u2019t care about that, but the lack of hygiene WITH this, makes me want to get it over faster than I can even fathom. Which means no foreplay and I am honestly left just super dissatisfied. I don\u2019t want to make out because his breath. I don\u2019t want to receive because I\u2019m worried about a UTI. And I don\u2019t want to give because it smells. \n\nAnd it sucks. I love him and I want to be with him but the smell is just awful, even after brushing his teeth or showering. He kind of just barely washes in either scenario and I\u2019m exhausted of explaining myself. What do I do? \n\ntl;dr - my husband never fully showers or brushes his teeth and sex sucks because of it - in every aspect. What do I do? ",

Thirty is a big milestone in life and this might be where there is a lot of self questioning, feelings of failure, wanting to \"find\" more, etc., especially with the death of a parent. While this has been going on for a long time, that can all start as one approaches 30. \n\nWith that said, I would not withhold sex in a hurtful and punishing way, but you should most definitely place your mental/physical health as a priority. This may look like having a very honest conversation about your fears of UTI or yeast infections etc. and that you want to be fully immersed in the experience but cannot do that with the concerns you have. This could be a time to offer to make and go the dental appointment with him (yes it sounds like handholding), and begin with rebuilding your \"friendship\" by learning your love maps, learning how to show admiration and affection (limited physical if needed) and improving how to have more difficult conversations. \n\nYou have been carrying the load for quite some time and this is not always easy or fair and being the first to create a new habit is hard, especially if there is no guarantee that our partners will follow. Keep your individual therapists while seeking a couples therapist, counselor, or coach. It can be helpful to work independently while together.

You can wait to change your name in Oregon you will change your name with social security first but you need to make sure you have at least 2 certified copies of your marriage certificate/license whatever it is in Colorado that has to come from Colorado. \n\nNow there is a concern about future ability to vote. If you do not have the means or ability to obtain and maintain a passport with your married name I would not change your name. Because there is a bill this administration is very actively trying to pass that makes it so you cannot vote without your name on your license matching your birth certificate. Which if you change your name to your husband\u2019s name obviously they will not match. However a valid passport can replace your birth certificate. So just consider your options. Personally I plan to keep and maintain my passport. I also had already changed my name before all this happened.",

        "text": "My husband and I have been married for a few months. A little over a year before we got married, his nicotine habit started to really escalate. I saw his body composition changing and he was becoming very quick to anger with me, starting to swear at me. He thought he\u2019d be further in life at work by that time, but blamed me for his career not advancing because our long distance relationship was getting in the way. He explained nicotine gave him clearer thoughts. \n\nWhen asked why he wouldn\u2019t eat for an entire day, he also said it would give him a clarity of mind but to me it just looked like he didn\u2019t know how to take care of himself. Now that we are married, he blames me for not eating enough and not eating lunch daily specifically. \n\nHere we are a few months into marriage and he\u2019s taking more nicotine (lozenges, pouches etc) than ever. He spends 5+ hours on the couch nightly watching tv & movies and playing a game on his phone called \u201cLast War\u201d. We haven\u2019t been on a date since our honeymoon, which cost over triple what we budgeted for and I paid for 80%. Money is a constant source of argument between us. \n\nI don\u2019t make more money than him, but I come from money and don\u2019t necessarily need to work. I always, however, worked until we met. I was actually studying to go to grad school when we met but was dabbling with art as a side hustle and hobby. He kept telling me I should go all in on art, which I finally said ok if he really believed in me. But now, it feels like his encouragement for me to become an artist full time was just him controlling me to become a stay at home wife. Every time I say \u201cI need to go back to a corporate role for _____ reason\u201d, he tells me that he thinks I should keep life flexible especially for when we start having kids. But he isn\u2019t making enough to give us the lifestyle we want and with kids. \n\u2026and even tho we haven\u2019t had sex more than 5 times since we got married. We have no sex life. We had sex 3 times on our honeymoon, if that. \n\nWhen I talk about us spending more time out of the house and with friends, he\u2019ll only want to see very specific people and with them it\u2019s in a specific environment. I\u2019m used to being a social butterfly and spending time at a local watering hole, which brings me a lot of joy, but he puts the place down so much I\u2019ve started to believe him implicitly that my old behaviors were bad. That my old friends weren\u2019t friends at all. \u201cBetter to have a few quarters than a thousand Pennie\u2019s\u201d. \n\nI know I want to be with him, I know I love him and am meant to be with him, but I\u2019m terrified we are in some bad habits that are hurting our relationship. I *want* to want him, but with how he\u2019s currently acting, I\u2019m just not impressed and feel completely shut down. \n\nTL;DR we\u2019ve both sunken into bad, isolating behaviors and are no longer intimate. What do we do to get out of this hole without me trying to control him? What way is forward? How do we find bliss again? ",

        "text": "My husband and I have been together for 3 years, married for almost 2 and we have a 21 month old son. This morning I found a Polaroid photo tucked into our couch of the naked behind of a woman. I confronted him about it and he's insisting it's an old photo of an ex from 2020. I'm hurt and confused and don't know if I can believe that story. \n\nFor context, we've been having a rough couple of weeks and haven't had sex in probably 2 months at this point. He's been driving Uber some nights and out until 2am. On a few occasions I've tried to see his location to find out if he'd be coming back soon and it's been turned off. Then it's back on the next morning once he's home. When I asked him about it he said he didn't know why it was like that, that he didn't turn it off, and I let it go because sometimes that happens randomly. I've had a small feeling that he might be out seeing someone but felt like I was being paranoid.\n\nWe've also had an ongoing issue in the past around porn. I've found him watching old pornographic videos of him and past partners and he was saving nudes of random women all the time. I expressed to him that I don't have a problem with him watching porn online but I am not okay with him keeping old videos from past relationships and not okay with him saving porn on his phone. He thought I was trying to control him but after talking about it again in marriage counseling he agreed to get rid of them and not do it anymore. But then I find this physical copy of a nude and I really don\u2019t know what to think. After finding it I immediately jumped to the thought that he was cheating (and I already had a small suspicion) but I also know he has a history of abusing porn. I have no way to confirm because it\u2019s a physical photo and doesn\u2019t have a timestamp like an iPhone photo, so I really feel at a loss.  If it\u2019s recent then he\u2019s been cheating and that\u2019s awful, but If it is old, it\u2019s still messed up because he\u2019s continued to disrespect my boundaries that I\u2019ve made very clear. \n\nHe\u2019s made it very clear that he is not sorry for this behavior because he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong. I obviously don\u2019t want to go through the process of divorce especially with a young child, but I fear I will continue to be disrespected by him for our entire lives if I don\u2019t take that step. What can I do?\n\n\nTL;DR: After finding a pornographic photo, I don\u2019t know if my husband is cheating or just continuing to disrespect my boundaries. Either way, I\u2019m not sure how to move forward",

I'm a marriage coach so there's a lot I want to say here but my first thought is - avoid a lot of generic advice like go to marriage counseling and tell him directly that you think he's cheating. What you actually want to do is get really clear on what your deepest pain is. Typically when women are concerned or paranoid about cheating it's because their desire for \"oneness\" aka closeness isn't being met. But our ego jumps in and inaccurately detects that there is a threat and wants to protect us so, our brains start spinning a story like \"maybe he's cheating\" so that the brain can protect itself. The problem is this story is usually not accurate and the underlying fear/ desire gets buried which leads to even more distance in a relationship which is the exact opposite that you are craving. I hope this helps as an initial understanding. As far as advice, as I mentioned, get really clear on your desire - closeness, etc. then find a healthy way to vulnerably say this. The simplest way to talk vulnerably about wanting closeness and feeling disconnected is to start with saying \"I miss you\".

I hate this feeling I get.  I talked to him and he assured me nothing is going on.  I didn't ask to see his phone because I just don't want to seem crazy. I mentioned to him that we need date nights.  He works away from home Monday through Friday and is away a lot for training.  I always trusted him until a few weeks ago when we got into an argument. He just seemed different.  Everything seems good now,  so I might just be super paranoid.  I hope that's what it is.",

But its not always cheating. I've never gone thru his phone bc I think thats invasive. But what we have done over the yrs during these periods is expressed how we are feeling like roommates or just not having fun anymore and are losing that spark. SO we then started making more of an effort to go on dates, play games together, or plan an overnight trip or weekend somewhere. Doesn't have to be fancy. It can even be a nice stay at a hotel for a staycation. Find that spark again. The minute people stop dating each other especially in longer relationships the more that spark dwindled. So put the effort in, dont accuse him of cheating and see what happens once u both try to plan dates and see the effort he places. We even picked one night a week to do something together. Each week taking turns to pick out something new and different to do. I.e. Frisbee golf, movie night, try a new restaurant, go to the museum, or go see a show or comedy show. Start off small it doesn't have to be expensive. Usually that rekindles the relationship and has worked tremendously for us to get that spark back. If you have kids dont make it an excuse, bc the marriage always still comes first. When you talk with him just tell him how you are feeling lonely and miss the spark yall had and you want to get it back, dont start off with accusing, etc that won't end well and will immediately cut off any efforts.",

I found not only dozens of random local single women, but also women he has met through work. This is on top of him admitting last year in counseling that he has a porn addiction and was using porn multiple times a day. \n\nI messaged a few of the girls because I went insane and some of them have said they know him through jobs he's done for them (he is a contractor). \n\nI tried to get past the porn issue and he promised be would stop but then it got even worse over time. Now he just hides it on a private browser app. I absolutely cannot get over him searching women he has met or looking at thirst traps from girls that live near us. \n\nI don't know how to move forward. Its been a week now and every day I'm on edge wondering what else he has been doing, imaginging the things that I'm not even aware he's done. \n\nAny advice? \n\nTl;dr husband has been searching for local women and women he's met on jobs. He has a history of porn addiction and sex addiction as well as cheating in previous relationships and when we were first dating. What should I do?",

It only gets worse if not stopped by an aware parent and if it's gone too far, a therapist.\n\nBesides that, your husband doesn't respect you, and doesn't have any reason to stop because there are no consequences for him to stop. Just think about your husband's activities and attitude toward porn. Going from porn to searching for women he knows or has the possibility of meeting is making you paranoid he's cheating. Can you live life searching for his activities or worrying he's cheating? If he's cheating what will you do then? \n\nThis isn't going to stop, he has you right where he wants you, feeling you're trapped. Only, you aren't trapped. You have choices, even if they're not comfortable ones to make. Discuss this with your therapist. Then decide what you want, and what steps to take to protect yourself and your kids.",

        "text": "I\u2019m really hesitant to post this but have thought about it several times so here I am. I\u2019ve been with my husband for a very long time, since we were teenagers. We\u2019re in our mid-30s now. We separated for less than a year a couple of years ago.  During that time, he held himself out to me, and everyone else, that he was just a good man working on changing himself to be the husband and father he needed to be and prove it to me. We explored reconciliation and we sat down and talked about everything that would need to change for it to work. I also asked him if he had been with anyone and that I needed him to be really honest with me for my health. I specifically said those words. \n\nWell, turns out he lied while looking me right in the eye. He basically had a whole relationship for several months during the separation. \n\nHe gave me a cancer causing HPV strain due to that. I\u2019ve only been with him and all my doctors point to his little fling given the time frame, my onset of infection that inflamed my poor cervix, etc. I believe them. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve had multiple locations of precancer inside me and outside of me because of it. I\u2019ll have to be closely monitored for the rest of my life. I had health anxiety prior to this incident. This situation is an absolute nightmare for someone with health anxiety.  I did not handle the diagnosis well. I spiraled for months, crying and researching all day for MONTHS. I barely made it out of that time. Then I was diagnosed with stage 2 out of 3 precancer on my cervix months later. It took the breath from me to get that diagnosis. I had surgery to remove that precancer and while the surgeon was doing that, he discovered vaginal wall precancer . It\u2019s incredibly rare. When I saw my note on my portal after surgery and saw where he had noted the wall dysplasia, I spiraled again. It was bad to have that one. The cervix can be removed if things are severe or recur over and over. No one is functionally or cosmetically missing their cervix. But the vagina itself? That taken from me?   He got it all out but recurrence rates weren\u2019t positive. 6 months later I finally tested negative on my PAP. I thought I could sigh with relief and maybe move on. But something kept nagging me that felt off.  I was diagnosed with vulvar precancer just three months later. It was like my entire world crashed. Another bad one to have. Recurrence is 50 percent and you\u2019re monitored forever. Chunks of you removed every 6 months or a year or maybe every couple of years if you\u2019re real lucky.  Many women go through god awful mutilating and painful procedures to keep cancer at bay just for it to then cancerous anyways. Even stage 1 of vaginal or vulvar cancer isn\u2019t great because recurrence rates are roughly 50 percent and if you have a recurrence, your survival drops down dramatically. If he would have not been a selfish coward and just told me the truth, I could have gone to the gyno and taken the HPV vaccines and been proactive. I never got them before because my parents never took me when I was a teenager and because I never worried since I was not sleeping with anyone but one person. \n\nI was changed forever. \n\nI\u2019ve been diagnosed with PTSD and most recently my surgeon said I have severe medical trauma so, yeah, didn\u2019t handle the whole thing well. Haven\u2019t had any recurrence yet but knowing there\u2019s ALWAYS a chance forever and always haunts me. There\u2019s not a day that goes by that I dont think about it and feel terrified.  Meds don\u2019t help. Tried lots. Nothing helps because nothing fixes death and nothing can stop what\u2019s coming if it\u2019s going to because I got the virus already. I feel as though I\u2019m running from cancer 24/7 with no rest. \n\nThe fun, funny, light hearted person I was is gone. I spend my days working and staring at the ceiling in pure depression and anxiety. I\u2019ve lost a piece of my labia that I\u2019ll never get back. I\u2019m 1000s of dollars in medical debt, which he hasn\u2019t gave me a dime to help with. Painful biopsies and surgeries. \n\nOne can\u2019t imagine health anxiety like this without experiencing it. It\u2019s flight or fight every second. Every goddamn second. Panic like you\u2019re drowning. I wake up drenched in sweat at night. I\u2019ll never be the same again. \n\nGiven everything I just laid out, to add, he has not changed a single thing that we agreed was a problem and that he agreed to change before we reconciled. Not one. \n\nThat makes things a lot worse. \n\nI thought time might heal my mental wounds with the medical trauma but it actually seems to be getting worse. I realized how much pure resentment I have for him. He got to eat his cake and have it too. He ruined my life and I have to deal with the consequences of his actions while he gets to sleep like a baby at night. It makes me sick. \n\nSo why don\u2019t I leave?   My children. I love those kids so much. I know they will face heartbreak and difficulties no matter what I do but I never want that to ever be because of something I did. Because of my choices.   And I know this will hurt them and it\u2019s essentially my fault because I\u2019d be the one pulling the plug and ripping their safe little world apart.  I thought I could put on a mask and pretend. I just thought, as long as they\u2019re okay, I will suffer and be fine. I can do this. Boy, I didn\u2019t realize how bad it would be. How hard it would be.   I don\u2019t know if I can keep doing this, not even for them and that destroys my soul. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what the point of posting here is. I guess to bitch. Idk. \n\nTl;dr husband gave me medical trauma due to a lie",

                "body": "Thank you for sharing something so deeply painful and personal. You didn\u2019t just \u201cbitch\u201d\u2014you told your truth, and it deserves to be heard without judgment.\nWhat you\u2019ve endured is profound trauma\u2014physically, emotionally, mentally. You placed trust in someone you\u2019ve known your entire adult life, someone who was supposed to protect and honor you, and instead, you were betrayed in a way that has left permanent scars. You're not weak for feeling the way you do. Your grief, rage, anxiety, and trauma are not only valid\u2014they\u2019re inevitable responses to what happened.\n\nIt makes perfect sense that you feel like your old self is gone. You're living with a constant sense of threat and loss. What happened should never have happened. You were not reckless. You were not careless. You were loyal\u2014and you were misled. You didn't consent to this trauma. You were denied the ability to protect yourself.\nAnd the most unbearable part might be this: he\u2019s not paying any of the price. You are. Every day. While he sleeps peacefully, you live with a kind of waking nightmare. Of course that resentment is building. That\u2019s not bitterness\u2014that\u2019s your brain screaming injustice.\n\nAs for your kids\u2014your love for them shines through every word. But here\u2019s a painful truth that many women carry: staying in a home where one parent is suffering silently\u2014losing herself, fading out, becoming a shell\u2014can also hurt children. They might not see the full picture now, but kids are sharp. They pick up on tension, tone, unhappiness, even if they can\u2019t name it yet.\n\nYou are not selfish for wondering whether staying is sustainable. You are not weak for thinking you can\u2019t keep wearing the mask. You are a woman who has been through medical hell, psychological betrayal, and emotional abandonment\u2014and you\u2019re still showing up, every single day, for your children, for your work, for life. That\u2019s strength, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it.\n\n\nNo one can tell you what to do next, but you deserve support. A trauma-informed therapist, a medical trauma support group, legal advice about your rights, even just a safe place to unload. You deserve a village to help carry this. Because no one\u2014no one\u2014should carry what you\u2019re carrying alone.\n\nPlease don\u2019t give up. You are not irreparably broken. You are in pain. But pain is not your identity. You are still here. That matters. And it\u2019s okay if all you did today was breathe.",

Another thing he always vents about is how his mother can't spend time with their child the way that his wife's mother can. So she will get to cuddle, hug, and put the child to sleep but his mother can't do any of that. \n\n  \nI've been coming home and just journaling because he's a real good friend of mine it's starting to stress me out too, I'm always trying to make sure that they're okay and always looking at the bright side of things rather than focusing always on their problems.\n\n  \nWhat does everyone think?\n\n  \ntl;dr My friend always complains about his wife being too involved with her parents/sister and letting her parents spend time and do things with their child.

My husband and I just got a really big fight over the weekend to the point where I have kind of decided that I might end up getting divorce sooner or later. It has been an ongoing issue with his drinking. But this time it went to another level to where he disrespected me by calling another female, which, by the way I feel in my gut was his ex-wife from years ago and completely talked poorly about me while I\u2019m in the other room. I can hear everything he say and I was so hurt and destroyed. I have let him know after it happened when he was sober how I really feel. as always, he says he couldn\u2019t remember and of course the number was deleted from his phone, so I\u2019m not for sure who he called but I know it was a female because of the way he talked on the phone. It just has me in a really bad mental space right now to the point I don\u2019t trust him. what makes it even worse is this coming weekend was my birthday celebration that I hadn\u2019t planned for us to go out of town. I already had told my daughter that it was just gonna be us because of our argument. They were really excited that he was gonna be there. A little background my girls are not too fond of my new husband. He has been trying to make it up to me trying to be extra sweet trying to be there for me more. But I just can\u2019t forget about it. So we are going to do marriage counseling which will start till June 3. I really wanna go on this trip especially cause it\u2019s gonna be just me and my daughter going. But he says like things that kind of make me feel bad for going without him. So I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing the right thing by going with my daughter to take some space to myself to relax or am I making it worse between us by leaving to this vacation trip?\n\nTl;dr it is ok to go on my planned vacation without my husband after a fight?\n\n",

No, this isn\u2019t a man who doesn\u2019t remember what he does while drunk; this is a man *choosing* to treat you like this, and then lying to you when he says he can\u2019t remember - the perfect excuse, apparently. Don\u2019t believe him. And now he\u2019s trying to guilt/manipulate you into not going with your daughter to celebrate your birthday? Hell, no! You need time away from this toxic man. Don\u2019t feel bad. Did he feel bad when he called up another woman and spoke shite about you while you could hear him? Did he feel bad lying to you about not remembering because he was drunk? Does he feel bad about any of the awful things he does to you, do you think? Of course he doesn\u2019t, because they\u2019re designed to make you feel bad. Please, please go celebrate with your daughter, and speak to her honestly about everything you\u2019ve been going through. You deserve so much better than this. Updateme!",

And it\u2019s your sweetness and patience that drew him to you, because you\u2019re perfect for the type of weak man who gets off on manipulating and emotionally abusing a partner. It\u2019s how he\u2019s always made himself feel important. Of course, what it really shows is how truly pathetic he is. This man is convinced that you will always do as he wants, because he doesn\u2019t see you as a strong woman. Please prove him wrong, before he robs you of any more of your self-esteem. It\u2019s time to show yourself that love and respect thats so sorely lacking from him, and rip off the bandaid. Yes, it will hurt, but how much more painful is it to bleed out with every argument and insult, slight and humiliation over months and years/ Talk to your daughter, and start making that plan.

I tried to compromise in the middle but she doesn\u2019t seem to want that and continues to do things that disrespects me. For example, we have a 19 months old daughter and I would love for her to have her naps and quite times at night. But on her side of the family, her nephew always come over to sleep and they are not the quite kind. I\u2019d bring up this issue many times and we have fought over this every time so I have had it and decided to laid out the rule, which is a compromise in itself. I told her they can come but they are not allowed to sleep over. One day I came home from work and it was late so I offered to take the nephew home. She said he was sad after hearing it so she\u2019s going to have him sleep over and not make a sound. I know that\u2019s bullshit and it\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to compromise again like before. So I contacted her sister to take her kid home. Wife didn\u2019t talk to me after what I had done and we haven\u2019t spoken since. This is just one of the examples where I felt disrespected by her. Right now I\u2019m contemplating to get a divorce but my daughter makes it that much difficult to do. I could never have my daughter be raised in a broken family. \n\nTl;dr getting disrespected at home and wants a divorce ",

                        "body": "While I tend to side with your opinion about quiet time, there is not actually a right or wrong answer in this case. You feel \"disrespected\" because you made a demand that your wife never agreed with, or finds her people pleasing self unable to agree with, and now you feel violated because she didn't do what you said. Like you're her boss and you get to fire her for not following your orders.\n\nHave a think about it. She's close with her family. You hate yours. Which type of family do you want your kid to grow up in? A loving one, or a broken one that is just you and the kid?\n\nYou realise that when you get divorced, and get 50/50 custody at best, you'll have to do everything for the kid when you've got them? Ll the stuff you're likely getting your wife to do atm?\n\nAnd guess what, she's still gonna have you kid half the time. So they're still going to get a shit sleep. Divorce is not the golden ticket you imagine it to be.\n\nGet on the same team as your wife. You and her against the problem. Firstly you need to discuss the problem and agree on what the problem is, and whether there is really a problem. Focus on your kid. Is your kid getting disrupted sleep? What is the impact on the kid? Is your wife OK with the sleep disruption that your kid is suffering? Does she perceive it to be a problem?\n\nIf yes, you need to discuss with her what boundaries she what ideally set to manage it. And then discuss what is realistic for her to hold and enforce on her own. She obviously feels uncomfortable setting and holding boundaries. Being with a champion boundary setter like yourself probably makes her feel even weaker about this.\n\nLook at her values. She values her child's sleep I imagine, but she also values her sisters approval. The child's sleep has a future impact on her, whereas the sisters approval is in the moment. When feeling weak, it is easier to cave to avoid pain now from her sister and minimise the pain later of the baby not having sleep. There's even a psych term for this. I tired to look it up - something like overwriting immediate emotional pain. Look at Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). \n\nThis would be a common marital problem and definitely not worth divorcing over alone. It's easier to solve it in couples therapy with a facilitator than alone, but go it alone if you can't afford therapy. \n\nThis is a result of miscommunication. All couples have it is varying ways. \n\nGood luck. \n\nI think it was a poor choice to call the sister while the incident was happening. If you want to call the sister, it would be more effective while her kid isn't at your house. Ask her to stop asking your wife to take her kid. Even if your wife agrees. Because you're trying to establish a sleep pattern. Tell her you're happy to reevaluate it a months time, but so not ask to stay in the next month, as refusal may offend!",

Personally I don't believe that kids get to make their own decisions about where they sleep. All they can do is ask. Adults decide.\n\nHow old is this nephew? Why does your wife want him around extra? Is there some missing info? Is he charming her to stay? Is he throwing a tantrum to leave, and she can't hack the tantrum?\n\nDefinitely don't divorce over this. You're a smart guy and you can work this out. You might have to have a few goes. And fail a few times. And you might feel very uncomfortable. You'll have to do a lot of listening and trying to understand, even if her reasoning sounds irrational, you'll have to withhold that judgement, and listen from a place of compassion, like you're listening to the woman you fell in love with rather than an adversary. \n\nEven if you coparent with your ex wife you're still going to have problems to resolve together, so you won't be able to avoid working out how to resolve disputes with her forever.",

Kids can chuck scary tantrums. Or is she sad she doesn't have her own 6yo son? Try not to see it as you VS the kid. It needs to be your kid VS the nephew. Your own child's routine must come first.

Do you think there might some issues with her childhood at play?  OR is this more a reflection of how you were raised vs how she was raised and your images of parenthood or marriage isn't matching and thus clashing.\n\nAlso I recommend you and her learn about 4 Horsemen by Gottman, this treatment of not talking is called stonewalling and its not not fighting its a silent fighting and destroying your marriage which you seem to be feeling. \n\nI hope you two really see a marriage counselor first, I would also encourage you to watch the videos and info by Marriage Helper and Gottman to help your marriage in the season of hell that is a marriage with little ones",

I would also setup a marriage counseling with your wife as well because there is going to be a need for extra support which you and her (specially her) are going to need moving forward so that the past doesn't keep sucking you two back and apart.  \n\nYou two can save this marriage but you alone and her alone can't save your verison of marriage you will have to come together and define what your marriage is going to be moving forward.  \n\nYou are a good husband and you are trying to help but it sucks to be rejected by your wife and by the mother of your beautiful child... it hurts deep and creates mistrust and that is something in you that triggers some past pains it seems like.  I really think you two can work through this but its time to sit down and paint the family and marriage portrait you both are happy with.  The tools of the past and the marriage of the past you had is over and its time to make a new one and a better one with this new amazing new person you two created.  You don't have to plan 5 or 10 years out but do a 2 year plan and keep coming back and making a new painting with your wife.  \n\nYou were once a young man with a tool belt, when you married you got a tool box to carry, but as new father you will need to add more tools moving forward to have your tool chest till one day when you are a grandpa you will have the tool shop to show your daughter and her partner and if lucky your grandkids what amazing things you can make in life with your tools.  You can fix a lot but right now its time to say hey we need to go to home depot to ask the experts what tools we need (therapy) and how to use them.  \n\nYou got this man, sorry you are suffering but there is hope",

First your daughter is 1 1/2, I hate to break it to you but this is normal for kids that age to wake up easy. Especially if they have been conditioned for quiet time. Its just like how your immune system works you have to be introduced to something to overcome it. But 2 different human beings are raising your daughter your wife values family instead of banning ask for specific nights where her nephew isn\u2019t there and set exact days that will work for you and her for him to be there that way you know and have time to mentally prepare. Your wife is upset because you did exactly what you didn\u2019t want her to do undermine/disrespect you. By calling her sister you essentially went against her decision and let her family know she has no say in the matter only you do(which from an outsider perspective looks awfully controlling). This had to embarrass her and probably made her feel unequal. Divorce over no quiet time? I can tell you right now its going to be reallll quiet half the time for you(it gets super lonely and weird at your age) and the other half will be just you caring for your child and shes getting to the age where sleep will be a constant battle and trust me you want a partner one on the same team. Work through it yall are wasting precious time not just for yourselves but your child, you said there are multiple reasons so Im going to guess you harbor and dwell, stop, your missing out on watching your daughter grow and your wife being a mother. Enjoy it now its over fast, my daughter is graduating highschool tomorrow there are so many things I wish I did different, appreciate what you have and know there\u2019s still plenty of time to fix it.

        "text": "My husband (38M) told me (37F) that he feels unappreciated, unattached and is not sure \u201cthat we are meant to be\u201d.  I asked him if he still wants to be married and he said he doesn\u2019t  know. We have been together for 12yrs and married for 2 with a 5yr old child. I was his first girlfriend. He has only been in situationships  prior to meeting me. He doesn\u2019t like to discuss his feelings and only talks when I initiate a conversation. He barely talks to me throughout the day and we only spend time together when we watch our favorite show on Fridays. We don\u2019t date often and typical only go out a few times a year.\n\nOur conversations are usually dry but he becomes very jovial when his friends or family call him. He is either glued to the TV, his phone or his PS5. I ask him to spend 20 or 30 minutes with me when I get home from work and he says he doesn\u2019t want to talk because he needs time to destress after work and likes to play when his friends are online. (FYI,  He arrives home 2 hours before I get home from work). He says he is overwhelmed with picking our child up from school and reports that he does a lot to make sure that she is fed (it\u2019s usually and happy meal and our child usually entertains herself or is glued to her tablet). His interactions with our child are very minimal at times. He doesn\u2019t clean or help me do anything in the house but will jump up and help others with their house.\n\nI am stuck in an emotionless marriage and not sure what to do. He doesn\u2019t  touch me and will only be interested I initiate sex. He doesn\u2019t initiate sex with me anymore. He does give me a kiss and when he leaves and when I return but that pretty much it. I think most of the issues he has may have may be within him self and not me. I do a lot to support him and our household and I\u2019m not sure what else I can do at this point. I asked him what can be done to make our relationship better, he reply was cook more and head!!!!! I also need to add that he has leaned on me a lot financially since I met him and I also paid for our wedding by myself. He started to support the household more last year. He pays the mortgage and a few bills, I pay the rest and pay for everything regarding my daughter except we share daycare expenses.\n\nHe recently started a weightless journey and is only focused on him self and his friends he works out with. He also recently started making a little more money and is less dependent on me. Just would like an outsider\u2019s perspective about our situation. Sorry to be long winded and all over the place but I don\u2019t have a lot of safe spaces to vent.\n\nTL;DR: Issues in marriage. Do you think this relationship can be salvaged or do you think it maybe time to hang it up? What can I do to make things better?",

        "text": "Almost two months ago, I made a post about my wife of almost a decade spending too much money but not helping with bills. I received a lot of good suggestions and try to sit her down and talk through it. Needless to say, she got mad, shut down, and refused to talk.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and she starts acting different. Very cold. Distant. I was no longer \u201cbaby.\u201d I no longer got texts saying \u201cI love you\u201d or \u201cI miss you.\u201d She would constantly reject intimacy saying she was still mad at me.\n\nA week ago, things felt VERY different. It was like I didn\u2019t exist and when I did, I was the most hated person in the room. Friday, I told her we needed to talk. As soon as we sit down she says \u201cbefore I say anything, tell me who told you!\u201d Long story short, she has been angry at me for a while, refused to say anything about it, decided to sleep with another man so she could feel something other than anger and, knowing I would be upset, decided to preemptively file for divorce the day before our talk. She said she \u201cmight\u201d change her mind about the divorce but I had to drastically change her mind to help her get over being mad at me. Shouldn\u2019t I be the one mad??\n\nI have two paths ahead of me. \n1)We get a divorce, I let her go, we end up in a custody battle that harms our son and I wreck her for infidelity (she filed irreconcilable differences so I would for sure contest it), I lose her forever and find a way to live with our good memories while also trying live as a divorced dad. \n2) we find a way to reconcile and I live with the constant image of her being intimate with a stranger. I cope with knowing I can\u2019t trust her with Facebook (how she met him) or to go get us food (where she said she was going when she went to him instead). Knowing that no matter how many years down the line we are, that damage will always be on my mind\n\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I haven\u2019t really ate or slept in days. My job is suffering. My son knows something is up and keeps asking if I\u2019m ok. I can\u2019t be alone without drowning in tears. I can\u2019t even look at her when she gets home because it just brings everything back to the surface. Help\n\nTl;dr: wife cheated on me because she was mad and filed for divorce before even talking to me, but might reconsider finalization. I\u2019m lost and don\u2019t know what to do ",

In most states long term marriage is 15-20 yes, some states 10. Look up long term in your state. Even if you decide to work this out, you need a lawyer to HALT the time on the marriage. Some states are no fault where infidelity doesn\u2019t matter and some states have IF you try to work it out, the infidelity is erased. So absolutely get a lawyer NOW.\n\n2) do NOT got to MC w/ your abuser. She\u2019ll learn all your vulnerabilities and weaponize the therapy lingo.\n\n3) get tested for STD now and again in 6 months- you truly have no idea if this is the first time she cheated.\n\n4) if & when you get your grandma\u2019s inheritance, do not commingle a penny into the marriage. That money/assets is legally 100% yours. She can\u2019t get a dime in a divorce.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 get a financial advisor to advice you of the property right on the maybe inheritance so you can take action fast. Everyone but your mom needs to pay rent. Houses have Maintance and taxes- you\u2019ll be responsible for those taxes whether you charge rent or not, so figure out what the taxes are plus a reasonable maintenance fund for: hvac, roof, etc on EACH HOUSE.\n\nIf you own all the houses, you\u2019ll be responsible for all this.\n\n\ud83e\udd17 you can get a real estate manager to take care of all the rent collecting and emergency maintenance (leak in the middle of the night.)\n\nAlso check insurance for that property as yours or rental. Find out if you knowingly rent to drug addicts if that defaults your policy- like if drug pipe or drug-induced memory loss to shut stove off causes a fire, are you covered.\n\nCause your not just maybe inherently this property, your also inheriting ALL the problems.\n\nYou cousin overflows the whatever and floods the house, cousin can sue you for every day the laundry machine is broken and days in a hotel (fear of breathing in mold/construction), and all sorts of ridiculous things that can cost you major dollars in legal fees & landlord penalties.\n\n5) see a therapist. DV shelters can give you Referals. You need a therapist that is familiar to with all the abuses plus PTSD that comes from BOTH abuse and infidelity.\n\n\ud83d\udea9 you are being abused!

So really the two options you have are a little different from what you mentioned:  option 1 is to divorce her on the basis of infidelity (don\u2019t let anyone make you change it unless it\u2019s her giving you a settlement that drastically is in your favor including shared custody).  Option 2 is for HER to come with a plan of action to re-earn you.  That means she makes a public admission of her infidelity where she names the guy publicly and takes all accountability for what happened with no \u201cbuts\u201d.  It means she agrees that you\u2019re entitled to a hall pass to sleep with someone else to even things out.  It means her signing a post nuptial agreement that gives you everything if she ever cheats again.  And it means she takes ownership of re-establishing your intimate life together where she sets up dates, initiates sex often and proves through total transparency that she is faithful and remorseful for acting like a selfish child.  That\u2019s option 2.  And the odds of her being mature enough to sign up for option 2 is almost non existent.  So that puts you back to option 1.  I would 100% let her know what option 2 looks like and see her reaction.  She will likely be petty and try to double down on it being your fault but depending on your legal situation based on her cheating you will be able to make her regret her choices.  This isn\u2019t the time to waffle.  You need to be cold and the only person saying they\u2019re sorry should be her.  !updateme",

Not to mention she had the audacity to what? Sleep with some guy after 10 years of marriage on some whim because she was mad at you? Who does that? What kind of person is she?\n\nCertainly not someone you can trust and grow old with. I even question her parenting when she buys expensive clothes for the child that they aren't allowed to wear. What kind of signal does that send to a child?\n\nI'm sure you love her, but what about her do you love? What is it about her character that you admire? Do you think you could ever trust her again since she responded to your request for help by radically sleeping with someone else while (if I'm correct) picking up food? That is kind of a weird situation. \n\nFrom the beginning your marriage didn't have reciprocity as one of its tenets. Take your happy memories and move on. Reduce your living expenses (she can now pay her own electricity bill) and start saving for retirement.\n\nFind someone whose values more align with yours and consider a joint account. I had friends who did the separate finances, and he had a gambling problem she didn't know about until he had withdrawn his retirement and some of their savings. He lied about where he was going for 2 years, so she divorced him. Luckily he didn't have access to her retirement. \n\nTake time to grieve and think about seeking professional help because I would propose that her behavior toward you over finances for almost a decade constitutes a form of financial abuse. \n\nBest of luck.

No one knows how hard it is to let go of someone and the life you envisioned with that person. It will take time but you are strong so you will recover. \nSecondly, I am a woman and I can clearly see where you wife lacks accountability and quite frankly, love. She has a son, did she ever stop to think how her actions will affect him?? Not even you in this instance since she clearly did this to hurt you but you're son did not deserve this from his mom. \nLast but not least, this is the time you will take to love yourself and pour into your son. Show him you don't tolerate disrespect and prove to yourself that you deserve genuine, honest and graceful love. I pray it all works out for you mister. God bless \u2764\ufe0f",

And it was her choice\u2014lots of choices: hundreds, maybe even thousands\u2014that led her to cheat on you, the man she\u2019s supposed to love and respect. From the sounds of it, this was all done to *punish* you for daring to speak to her about her spending. And did you see any signs of her shame after it happened, because it sounds like she just carried on punishing you until she thought she\u2019d been rumbled.\n\nPlease don\u2019t let her blame you for something that is wholly her responsibility. She could have spoken to you at any time about how she was feeling, but she *chose* to stew in her anger while she thought of the best way to get back at/hurt you. Honestly? Do you really see yourself reconciling with this woman? Reconciliation only works when the cheater is fully accepting of what they\u2019ve done and the damage they\u2019ve caused. *She\u2019s* the one who has to lead, not you. Until she\u2019s ready to accept she\u2019s the one at fault\u2014not you\u2014and can show *genuine* remorse (the absolute starting point of reconciliation), it won\u2019t work. You\u2019ll continue in this toxic cycle, whereby she treats you however she likes because she\u2019s punishing you for something you probably don\u2019t even know you\u2019ve done.\n\nYour child will not thrive in this environment. And neither will you. My advice is to seek your own legal advice with regard to divorce, and go from there. It\u2019s time to love and respect yourself enough to know that you deserve so much better than this. Updateme!",

Ideally, separate for a few months and try to cool down.\n\nThird, if you talk about getting back together (preferably after a while) or if you simply consider this possibility, forget about her facebook, her going out to buy food, and her infidelity altogether. None of that really matters. If you still love each other, if you think you enjoy being together, then you should be able to overcome whatever happened in past. If you can't, it's not worth it.",

Sex life has been in the gutter for months. Few weeks ago she told me she wants to move out to let us both heal ourselves prior/in conjunction to healing the marriage. Divorce talk happened and she agreed it will be the worst case scenario.  \nShe\u2019s been staying with friends most days of the week for 2/3 weeks now and has started to move into a short term rental home in town. We talk daily still, exchange I love yous and hugs. \nShe has been attending therapy for about 3 months now, we talked about it and I have signed us up for couples therapy, she asked me to do the first two sessions myself then she will join after that. We started using the Paired app and since she has actually started using it I feel like we are opening up more and more. Our communication has been sub par most of our relationship and this app is helping be the middle man in it. \nMy question is those who have separated but stayed married how did you rekindle or if you didn\u2019t how long did you stay in the situation before calling it done? I really want it to work out and am willing to do whatever it takes and as I told her if this is what she wants to try and make it work I\u2019ll be at home when she\u2019s ready to come home. \n\nTl;dr My wife wants to move out to heal our relationship.

The ONLY way a separation can work is if you truly trust each other and together agree to rules around what is acceptable during the separation.  Rule #1 has to be no dates, no sex and no \u201cexploration\u201d with another person.  If you bring that into the scenario and she is unwilling to commit to that or you see her get visibly nervous at the mention then go ahead and get your attorney because it\u2019s too late.  Trust me, you don\u2019t want to stand by and work on your marriage while she is testing out a new ride and deciding if she wants you or him.",

Couples counciling can be very helpful if you have specific issues that both parties recognize and  that aren't dependent on anyone having to feel a specific way. For example, communication and conflict management are things that can benefit from this, things that aren't good to address would be differences in sexual desire or general interest.\n\nAssume the marriage is over, besides seeking validation from other woman what can you be doing to be the man you want to be and to achieve your future goals?

I get it yeah its hard and one person will suffer more than the other but it shows what words can't trust and thats you are putting in the work and that you are prioritizing the relationship and reconciling over work or whatever else.  \n\nGosh kids that young are the hell years because they are so dependant on one or both parents its hard to breathe and not just breathe for yourself but also together.  So I hope you know this isn't uncommon and if you two can work together on yours and towards each other then this will ride out the season till the new season and the new marriage you two will make in that season.\n\nI think you need to communicate what the image of separation and reconciling looks like to you and they need to do that as well.  I feel that is kind of the issue here as well you two both have different pictures and that mesh is not meshing and makes a stressful life even more stressful.  So I recommend talking but I would honestly say sitting down together and clearly and openly communicating what reconciling looks like and what it doesn't look like.  SPECIALLY when it comes to outside influncers or coping mechanisms that might be other people, beware of an emotional affair when you are emotional distress and beware of a physical affair when you are lonely, this goes for the two of you.\n\nMarriage Helper has a thing called Love Path and its kind of a road map to help couples reconcile so I would encourage checking that out.  I would also encourage their videos on PIES of Attraction.  \n\nWhat was the reason they told you they had to leave?",

She looked at apartments but decided she didn\u2019t want to commit to a 1 year minimum lease as she is hoping to be back within the next few months as long as I can continue to prove my changes are real. Family friends of ours has a home they planned to air bnb this year that they said she can rent it basically month by month till she is either ready to move back in with me or until we decide we are both in a better place without each other. I had a therapy session last night and mentioned that to him and he said to me it sounds like she \u201cwants to be done\u201d but doesn\u2019t want to be done at all or else there would be zero talk of coming back and fixing the couples issues.",

I think from what you just said she has been trying to communicate that your sacrificing yourself is affecting the family and that if you won't listen or trust her then she will do the next best things and walk away so you are left alone with your demons that are conflicting you and robing you of yourself and her of her husabdn and your kids of their father.  If you won't listen what can she do... so walk away and wait and watch to see what the truth is here.  I bet you if you asked her and told her that if thats why she left she will say yes.  Its not that she hates you but she is hating who you were becoming and that was the shell of the person you used to be and the person she loved and trusted.  Sadly now she doesn't trust you and so she waits for you to show up and show change.  Basically the way I am seeing this is like cheating and you are trying to reconcile a marriage with her.  You can do this but you have to understand WHY you did this... to me sounds like your not happy with your work anymore because work has become too much.  I get that and there is only so much you can do about work before you say I can't anymore and walk away.\n\nYeah so WHY did you honestly lose yourself... do you think your job in the marriage and family is to scarife yourself to provide... what does a good provider look like to you... who modeled that role for you... \n\nDepression is a silent killer of millions of men each year",

For perspective: We have two children and he works full time while I am a SAHM. He travels for work occasionally and while he\u2019s away it feels impossible to have a decent conversation with him. He doesn\u2019t respond or tells me he will call, then doesn\u2019t.  I\u2019ve told him that it hurts my feeling when he doesn\u2019t follow through with his promises. He says he will do better then doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a reoccurring things every time he leaves town for work. \n\nHe recently came home from a week gone. We got into a small argument about how my doctors appointment went late and he was, in turn, late for work (because he was watching our son). It spiraled into a bigger argument where everything was laid out on the table. Long story short I expressed that I needed more action from him. I told him I wanted him to make more of effort with our relationship such as spending more quality time together, or him expressing to me how he feels about me once in a while. He told me I have too high of expectations and he needs more space from me in order to be able to give me quality time. \n\nI guess I am just confused. I don\u2019t know how to give him more space. He comes home and sits on his phone on the couch (I try not to bother him so he can decompress from work) then after the kids go to sleep, he goes and plays video games until bed. Yes we are in the same room together, but in my mind this isn\u2019t spending time together. He just had a week away from home and still wants more space. \n\nI don\u2019t feel like we are aligned with what we need. I really need a partner who can love me the way I need to be loved and he needs space from me to be able to love me? Some outside perspective to help me better understand the situation would be helpful or advice from people who have gone through similar. \n\ntl;dr \nI need closeness, husband needs space ",

I\u2019ve had a vasectomy for almost 5 years now so her getting pregnant is a bit of a stretch. Now she had told me she took one test and it was negative.  Now mind you I don\u2019t think she would cheat but anything is possible. She works at this law firm and been working there about two years now and one day out the blue she tells me about a building engineer and how he always flirts jesters like her outfit and her shoes and jokingly says she must have a hot date after work. She has told me he sometimes comes to her work area and says hi to all the other women there. So I don\u2019t really think anything about it much. But suddenly shes going in to the office on her work at home days and says it\u2019s because they need an admin there for idk what\u2019 (she\u2019s an executive assistant) . so I did a little research. Maybe I\u2019m worried she might have slept with someone. I don\u2019t know so I did a little research on the Plan B pill and the Plan B pill can delay a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle now keep in mind her menstrual cycle has never been late since we\u2019ve been together for the last 10 years. Any real advice would be greatly appreciated. female 31 male 45.\n\ntl;dr we been married for over ten years and she has never been late.

She an assistant of sorts? Seems like that should be an in office job because of answering phones and stuff? Could things be busier at work that she does need to be more hands on in office?\nUltimately,  does her personality seem different...  if nothing else seems off, I would try not to stress so hard.  Ask her more questions about her work, stress level. Does she seem happy? Or happier suddenly?   These are all things I'd think about.\n\nAlso, if you have a good relationship..... just talk to her? Not in an accusatory tone.. just express your concerns...  if she gets mad and defensive... that could be your answer right there.  If she's just stressed at work or about life, that's totally reasonable why her period could be delayed. \n\nOn the other side.. have you stepped out or done anything you shouldn't have? (Don't answer, just something to think about)  because sometimes people project their fears when they're the ones doing the shady shit. \n\nMy husband cheated for 12 years. Constantly accused me of doing stuff when all along he was the one cheating.  So..  I hope she's not cheating! I hope she's just stressed (not a good thing to hope, but rhw best outcome, I think).

I totally get that your wife\u2019s missed period, coupled with your vasectomy, made you consider the worst. However, periods aren\u2019t set in stone and can fluctuate at any time, and for a myriad of reasons. Look at it this way: if your wife knows you\u2019ve had a vasectomy, why the hell would she let you know she was taking a pregnancy test if she\u2019d been cheating? She\u2019d want to hide the fact. I was in a similar position several years ago. I was 39 and had my first *ever* late period\u2014it ended up being about two weeks late\u2014and did a pregnancy test: negative. I honestly have no idea if my husband ever had the same thought as you. Like your wife, I was just open about what was going on with my body.\n\nSo, unless there are other neon red flags\u2014and I don\u2019t personally consider mention of a guy in the office, and going in extra to help out as particularly neon\u2014I suggest letting this \u2018pregnancy\u2019 idea, as an indicator or her cheating, go.

Stress, hormones, any number of reasons for a late period.\n\n2) her behavior changed recently (according to what you said).

Date night, some sexy time, etc. \n\n3) Im not sure if I would jump to the cheating flag just yet. Is she not home for long periods outside of work? Is she texting this engineer guy? \n\nAn easy solution to all this is to tell her how you feel. Not that you think she's cheating but that you are concerned with her new schedule and her mentioning this guy. Maybe she's trying to make you jealous to pay attention to her.

        "post-author": "yeepanon",
        "text": "I never really thought I would write this so please bear with me. I feel like I could really use some reassurance that I\u2019m not losing my mind.\n\nMy wife and I have been married for almost 2 years but have been together for a while, since 9th grade in fact. She\u2019s who I lost my virginity to, and I her. We have always been extremely close. We can read each others minds, we can feel each others emotions. But lately it just feels like we\u2019re roommates.\n\nTo add more context, we started dating freshman year of high school and everything was great. We had sex often and were really in tune with each other physically and mentally. Things were pretty much the same for the next 6 or so years through college. Then suddenly, our sex began to get more and more sporadic. I know this is normal as we both accept more demanding jobs and life\u2019s stressors take hold but days grew into weeks and weeks into months between sessions. \n\nI personally need physical attention. Physical touch is my love language so as you can imagine, sex is important to me and helps me feel connected to her. When I have confronted her about this, I try to do it in the gentlest way I can. I have done this for a long time (mostly when slumps are longer than usual) but she typically says that she just isn\u2019t in the mood, or that her sex drive is low. We've had this conversation many times by now and it always ends with the same result (nothing chnages). For a long time she said she felt like something was wrong with her because she had no libido. I encouraged her to go to the doctor, get hormone testing done, whatever she needed but she won\u2019t go.\n\nSeveral years back I noticed that I have slowly but surely pulled away from her sexually. I have a naturally high sex drive and contantly being told no when I'm in the mood for years has led to me not wanting to try and push for it anymore at all. not to mention that she never seems to be interested when I try tto hint at it.\n\nI am stuck because this weighs heavily on me most days. I often ask myself if she still finds me attractive or if she is still even interested in having sex with me. It's really hurt my ego over the years to be honest. I have asked her this question as well and she always assures me that she does but If she feels that way then why doesn't she show that through her actions?\n\nI want to be clear on a few things here so there are no assumptions necessary. Firstly, I am relatively fit and what I believe is atleast average in terms of actriveness. Secondly, So you can better understand the time frames, my wife and I have gotten to the point where we won't have sex for a month or longer at a time. Sometimes when we break a dry streak we will have sex a few times within a week or two but then it just goes back to long breaks. This feels wrong as we are still young and I am still very attracted to her. It is also worth noting that when we do have sex and she is \"in the mood\", it is great, kinky, and fun. I always make sure that she is fulfilled as much as I can. However, sometimes even after a month of not having sex it feels like shes not really interested while were doing it. Like she is just doing it to appease me instead of wanting to do it on her own volition. This is almost even worse than just not doing it at all for me because I can easily tell the difference.\n\nI don't know what to do here. I love my wife and when we do have sex multiple times in a given week I feel very close to her but during these droughts intimacy gets put on the back burner and I am left feeling unwanted and unsatisfied. I would do anything for my wife but it kind of feels like I am powerless in this situation. Am I asking for too much? Am I asking for it to often? Has anyone else had this problem before and can provide some guidance? Please feel free to ask for clarificaiton on anything here but It would be helpful to here anyones thoughts on this.\n\ntl;dr: My wife and I's sex life has been withering away and I feel like I have no control over how to fix this. This just feels like the norm at this point and it does not feel healthy to me. What do I do?",

                "body": "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re asking for too much.  Studies show that female sexual desire in a long term relationship falls much sooner and faster than it does in men, and that it\u2019s not correlated with relationship satisfaction. So this may just sort of be a thing that\u2019s happening to you through no fault of your own.  There\u2019s a book called Mating in Captivity by Ester Perel that I think goes into solutions for this kind of thing, so maybe check that out.  There\u2019s also a book that\u2019s often recommended on Reddit called No More Mr. Nice Guy, which may also be helpful for you.\n\nThese books touch on this, but it could be helpful for you to de-center your life around her and invest more in yourself. Focus more on friends, family, hobbies, working out, dressing better, eating better.  You\u2019re not ignoring her or being a dick, but you\u2019re putting yourself first just as she\u2019s putting herself first. Give her space to miss you and see that you\u2019d be a catch for some other woman.  Hopefully to show that she shouldn\u2019t take you for granted.  And I\u2019m sure when you were first dating, you had other interests and things going on.  Try to get back to that place. I think you also need to consider being prepared to end your marriage if things don\u2019t improve.  Right now, she\u2019s basically getting what she wants and so has no incentive to change.   Your feelings clearly aren\u2019t enough of one, so you need to be prepared with others.\n\nAnd lastly, I heard this on Reddit a while ago, i think from an older guy who was basically in your situation.  I can\u2019t remember if he or someone said this to his wife, or she came to the realization herself, but the gist was: we can break up because of lack of sex (or even sustained effort in that direction), but the next guy you\u2019re with is going to want to have sex with you too. The problem isn\u2019t just going to go away, so wouldn\u2019t you rather work on it with me?",

                "body": "Sorry you\u2019re going through this. \nLet me tell you what I\u2019m hearing:\nIt\u2019s quite possible she\u2019s been in a long term relationship with another person outside of your marriage.  Let me tell you why I say this. When she\u2019s in contact or connected with someone else, your sexual needs will go unmet. When this other person is ignoring her or not responding to her messages, she will be sad for a little while and might take it out on you. And then she will feel the situation with this other person is over. At this point, she would possibly start trying to be intimate with you again. And I don\u2019t mean just sex, I mean be more affectionate and more present and pleasant. When this guy reaches out to her again and they\u2019ve reconnected, she won\u2019t want you to see her disconnect from you. So she has trained you to identify her emotional highs and lows is because of stress, or work and not someone else. \nThis means, she has made it so you don\u2019t feel comfortable speaking out about your needs and desires. \nIt was great that you suggested she go talk to a doctor about her possible hormonal issues and disinterest in sex. But she didn\u2019t. Because she knows what is really going on. If she were really wanting to make a change and she was worried there was something truly wrong, she would have made that appointment a long time ago. \nBut this was just to pacify you. So you\u2019re in a stagnant place.  And when you\u2019re in this place, she doesn\u2019t have to have sex with you or engage in anyway that you would benefit from. You\u2019re accustomed to the highs and lows. You won\u2019t know the difference between the days. A woman will do anything for the man she loves and desires. If she believes there\u2019s a medical issue that\u2019s affecting this and your sex life, she would address this and get it fixed. Women also will feel disgusted that the man who claims to love them and know them so well, doesn\u2019t see that they are no longer interested or that their attention is elsewhere. She\u2019s comfortable now. With your finances, your position in her life, your sexual positions, your technique. There\u2019s no excitement, no mystery. But it sounds like she got a taste of another man\u2019s technique. Sorry. Ripping the bandaid off here. That new experience with another man is one that she feels she can\u2019t really let go of. \nJust think\u2026.when you go to work, you spend at least 8 hours a day with the people you work with. There\u2019s a HUGE chance there\u2019s somewhere there that might pique your interest. Or even on social media or at the gym. That interest can turn into intent and then that intent will turn into action. Then there will be high peaks and low valleys when it comes to your sex life and your emotional connection with your partner and your conversation. Those high peaks and low valleys are what you get when there is a third party added to your \u201cwave\u201d that you originally created together and for each other. The wave is your relationship, the normal flow of your relationship. Our relationships are waves and those waves create patterns that become our relationship norms. There are things that affect our wave, one of the biggest things is another person, ie. the high peaks and low valleys. The other person will affect all of this. Imagine a graph. In that graph you have a straight line running from right to left. That line is your sex life. As you begin to ascend to this high peak, the intimacy, the hand holding, the cuddles, the Netflix and chill together, the dates start to dwindle or lessen. This is where the dry spells are. What you explained is the downfall from the peaks. When she\u2019s going down from this peak, that\u2019s when you\u2019re getting closer to that line that represents sex, so that\u2019s when the affection and attention starts again. The low valleys are the other person and all their interactions. She\u2019s dropped below your sex line and then she\u2019s busy and stressed about work and not feeling the intimacy, which is only an excuse as to why she\u2019s distant or not interested in sex with you. If she\u2019s not being mean to you ever, then she might still at least be considering not blatantly hurting you. Because let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s possible to love someone but not be in love with them. But she will not just have sex with you because you want it if she\u2019s not interested in you anymore. Women don\u2019t operate that way. Women want to be pleased and if you\u2019re not doing that they will resent you for it and make up excuses as to why it\u2019s okay that they\u2019re cheating. Because their needs and desires have to be met. \nI\u2019m sorry if this was a little rough but I try to be as clear and honest as possible when giving people advice about their relationships. Who wants to waste their time? Not me. I\u2019m sure not you. \nTake some time to self reflect. And think about all the patterns you\u2019ve experienced in your marriage. \nWe talk a lot about these same issues in our book. I also talk about this on my TikTok. Check it out. You might hear some things that hit home. Here\u2019s my TikTok info: https://www.tiktok.com/@marriedtomelanin?_t=ZT-8wavNdXeo0s&_r=1\nIf you don\u2019t want to buy the book, (the link is in my TikTok profile) listen to some of the things I\u2019m talking about. I have a very large male following because men truly connect with the things I\u2019m saying and I give them unbiased, brutally honest information. \nMy husband and I are relationship coaches.

Considering you both of demanding jobs, she could also be emotionally tired. We\u2019ve all been there so it\u2019s understandable.\n\nAnother thing I wanted to bring up, is she on antidepressants or anti anxiety meds? This can play a huge roll in lowering your libido. My husbands libido lowered to nonexistent last year and it was very frustrating on me because (much like yourself) one of my love languages is physical touch. If she is on medication, she can ask for a different one that won\u2019t have a huge effect on her libido. I would suggest looking into it with her, if this is her situation.

From what you have written I would say so.\n\nThe one thing you say you have going for you is that you are at least average looking, and most of the post is you explaining things you do that are having a negative impact, and how even when these things don't help anything you keep doing them.\n\nAdditional things negatively impacting your sex life include your self confidence isn't what it could be and you feel disconnected from your wife, and guess what, recieving more validation from your wife in the form of sex wouldn't actually do anything to improve these two things.\n\nYou have to stop treating sex as a need, doing so has led to a lot of your frustrations, makes you dependent on your partner instead of yourself, and led to you treating your wife like she is obligated to desire you when that isn't at all how desire works and your sense of self isn't her responsibility. Worst of all treating sex as a need has led to you doing the same things repeatedly but expecting different results.\n\nYou have to find yourself again as an individual and stop being dependent on your partner. Your self esteem isn't her responsibility and she shouldn't be your entire support system and source for feeling connected to others. You have to respect your partner as an individual (a big part of that is start paying gauging her interest before initiating/escalating, you have faced a lot of rejection because you have initiated many times without much if any consideration of your partner. \n\nNext these two individuals can connect. You have to keep in mind she isn't going to be interested in you because you ask her too, she will be interested in you if you are interesting and spending time with you makes her life more interesting.",

I worked abroad for couple of years worked in other city been away for even a month but she never acted the way she does now. Currently I work in security so have to be away for like 2-3 nights a week and she seems to be losing her mind missing me if I am not at home or by her side like when I spend a night or two at home she would start missing me the moment I leave for work and by missing I mean she would be texting me like every every 10 minutes and when I would be busy and couldn\u2019t text back she would become depressed and stop talking to me. I am not complaining but I am really concerned for her. So I wanna ask does anyone else experience this? Should I be worried about her? Should do something about it? Would really appreciate advice.\nPS: English isn\u2019t my first language so I apologize if I did any mistakes in writing.\ntl;dr: Wife\u2019s been missing me a lot lately even if I am gone for a couple of hours.",

Does she have someone with whom she can honestly share her thoughts and feelings, other than you? Was she abandoned as a child? Because childhood stuff often comes up in bouts, especially if there is an underlying mental health issue, even if undiagnosed?\n\nI honestly think if you suffer mentally or emotionally it is never wrong to speak to a therapist, the way you would go to a doctor for random knee pain, you know?",

The fact that she texts her dad, you and her brothers more than any female friends shows that perhaps she feels insecure and craves it from the people who can give any in your society, which is men. I would sit down and ask her what her fears are, and listen honestly and without becoming dismissive and defensive, even if it seems irrational to you.

Clearly she adores you and by you reaching out to try to help her shows how much you love her. Some people just need more reassurance that they are safe and loved. It's surprising with such a large extended family how anxious she gets.

It's been proven by psychology and sociology experts that a stay-at-home wife should balance her daily activities with a hobby, a craft, and spending time with family and friends outside of the home for the enrichment of her mental health. \n\nAccording to your post, she's expressing symptoms of anxiety due more likely to loneliness and boredom. \n\nBy saying boredom, I don't mean she's bored of being lazy and not engaging in her household's expected responsibilities. You can be the perfect wife and still be bored out of your mind because our brain depends on socializing to be active and healthy. \n\nI'd also advise her to see a therapist, so she can have the support of an expert to help her learning skills to manage her anxiety, and if needed, getting treatment. \n\nGreetings.",

I have a 6 and 4 year old and are just scrambling out of the position you are currently stuck in. Has it been fun? Hell no, this has sucked horribly and I miss my wife. I love my kids but they absolutely suck the soul out of your relationship if you let them. You know what happens if you and your husband don\u2019t put time into your relationship? Possible separation and both of you have to do everything for yourselves along with having the kid at least half the time. Oh and you also get half the income. \n\nGo talk to your husband and tell him what you\u2019re feeling and that you would like to find a babysitter and go out more. You need to focus on the relationship between the two of you or the dreaded thoughts of \u201cI love him but I\u2019m not in love with him\u201d surface.

Love languages are a minute part of a relationship, and frankly are far far over used now days to put 1 label on an immensely complicated human. \n\nIn your case, you seem to have micro focused on your love language of quality time, while admitting that the thing preventing it is simply the rigors of daily life. I assume since you don't feel like you're getting yours, then you're purposely withholding all forms of physical intimacy because, just by pure coincidence I'm sure, he isn't providing yours...his is a bi product of a busy life, partly providing for you, and yours is an excuse, at least that's how this very short post seems. \n\nAside from all of this, everyone has at least a little bit of each love language in their romantic make up. If both partners actively provide all of them while focusing on the main ones, they'll be much better off, rather than dwelling on one small factor as if it's all there is to life. \n\nNow, for the real deal on the love languages IMO. It's not a sensible road map for a happy LTR. While the theory is good, it's flawed in that most people's identified LL changes over time. It's not typically an overall personality trait, but typically the main one people identify with correlates with the one they feel they're missing the most at a given time. How do we know this? Nearly every couple with children identify as this: man = physical touch, because he wants more sex, which typically declines after marriage and kids. Woman = acts of service or quality time, because she's exhausted being the main provider of the children or just has constant general anxiety about raising them. I've been on relationship subs and following counselors a very long time, and this same dynamic is posted over and over as if it's unique...but it's almost always like this. If he dropped everything today and made his main priority in life spending time with you, I almost  guarantee that your LL changes to acts of service within a few months.",

It is what you like/bring to the table to make your home run. \n\nAs for your feelings toward your relationship, I think first you need to talk to you husband. Even show him your post here as it summarizes your feelings. Maybe he feels the same distances too? Maybe he's just a stuck but doesn't know how to approach you about it?  Conversation and open communication is key. \n\nThat's the first step. See what you both can do to re-kindle that spark. Maybe a date night once a month?

The cops came home, and took me to jail. I slept in jail with my soon-to-be-born boy (8-months pregnant). I was left free the next day, but this has affected me profoundly. This will forever show up in every background check.\n\nUnfortunately, for me and us, I had already physically attacked him in the past. Multiple times. He eventually started responding with physical aggression back.

Right after the jail incident, my mom has moved in with us to help with the house chores and the raising of the kids. \n\nOur son is now 1 year old. I still haven't gotten over what happened. We are parents of 2 kids. Our daughter is 3 years old.\n\nHow can I forgive my husband for having been in jail? Should I accept my husband as he is? Or should continue to work with him so he contributes more in the house chores and in raising the kids? What can we do to improve our relationship?\n\nTL;DR\nI blindsided my husband with a slap on the face while his back was facing me as he was folding clothes. I had slapped him before in the past.

        "text": "Sorry in advanced for the novel\n\nMy husband (M29) and I (F26) have hit yet another rough patch in our marriage. I\u2019ve made numerous Reddit posts in the past regarding issues in our marriage that I\u2019ve either hidden or deleted out of fear. My husband and I got married after 28 days of courtship. We both knew we wanted to be married and we had always struggled to find partners who wanted the same thing (a God centered marriage). \n\nMy husband has a child from a previous relationship. He was 19 and in college when he had a kid and when I came into his life, his child was 3 and he got along fairly well with his child\u2019s mother when I first got with him. After we got married she requested more child support and took him to court. She was granted her request and it led to financial hardship, but we made it work. Once his kid started school she filed for full custody and as a result we rarely see his kid. \n\nBefore us having a kid, he was a pastor and had a small church. During this time we would get into fights where he would yell at me, call me degrading names, break things around the house and throw things at me. There were times where he would make his praise team wear shoes in the house because of the broken glass all over our floors. After only a few months of being with him I was already ready to take my losses and leave but after speaking to family and elders they encouraged us to work it out and go to God. Long story short, he quit ministry since we were struggling and he didn\u2019t have anymore help to run his church (eventually our friends and family stopped coming to our church).  \n\nAfter the church ended and I got pregnant, we decided to move in with his mom and we were still having issues of him being emotionally hurtful towards me and I again contemplated divorce but stuck it out so our kid could be in a home with mom and dad. After he quit his job to do YouTube I kept working and was taking care of our newborn while working from home. I was the main one providing financially and taking care of our newborn while also keeping his mother\u2019s home clean. I was overwhelmed and stressed so he told me I could come off my job and we would live off of his YouTube income and cash aid. \n\nFor the past 2 years we have been living with different family members and he doesn\u2019t make much on YouTube. This year he decided to go back to school to earn a degree (I am also in school and almost finished) so that he can become a teacher while working YouTube on the side. He also does Amazon flex for extra income, but he can be quite sloppy at times with his delivery and as a result he has an at risk standing. (I get frustrated by it because I tried to help him with his deliveries but if something seems complicated or he doesn\u2019t want to find the specific apartment or locker he gives up and marks the package undeliverable which leads to your rating going down.) \n\nHe doesn\u2019t see his kid much and it bothers me to see them living a life far from God and being influenced negatively. When he reaches out to his child (10) they don\u2019t respond and they often times seem disinterested in a relationship with him. I feel that it\u2019s a result of not paying child support and us not having our own home for his kid to come to and be with us at. When I address my concerns he tells me I am disrespectful and not a submissive wife. I asked him if we could go to counseling to work out our differences and see eye to eye but he said he doesn\u2019t want to go to counseling \u201cjust to hear them say the same exact things he already tells me\u201d. \n\nHe says that our relationship doesn\u2019t work because of my bad attitude and abrasive tone when addressing things that concern me. We currently live with my grandma and we have no savings. I recently had a miscarriage and it opened my eyes to so much. A lot of our marriage was spent with me supporting his dreams and passions even though it put us in financial hardship. He spent a lot of time putting me down and telling me that I am an \u201cinadequate wife who doesn\u2019t know how to be a wife or a mother and that it isn\u2019t my fault because my mother abandoned me as a child\u201d. \n\nThe thing that really put me off was when I saw he had been looking at my little sister\u2019s and my friend\u2019s social media accounts on a daily basis. When I confronted him about it he said it was because he was trying to hook up his friends (his friends are married and he essentially helped one of his friends cheat on his wife.) with my friend and sister. A part of me doesn\u2019t believe him but I don\u2019t know what to believe. I would hate to think he has been lusting over my friend and little sister because the type of posts they make are very flirty with lots of skin showing. \n\nWhen I saw what he had been doing behind my back, it shifted something in me because I had been feeling like I was a terrible wife this whole time but I took a step back and saw the constant sacrifices and pain I have endured all while being told how horrible I was and in the entirety of our relationship he has not taken care of us. When I first got with him his credit was shot and had no savings but he always had to have a brand new car and the latest iPhone. He used my savings that I came in with to pay off debts and over time my credit went down bc of cars he bought in my name that he ended up losing because he quit his job. I worked the first half of our marriage and when I stopped to be at home so did he and the government as well as family have been keeping us afloat. \n\nThroughout our marriage we\u2019ve had disagreements about finances, biblical viewpoints, his relationship with his kid (I feel he could do more), and what he sees as disrespectful. (I don\u2019t call him names or get irate but I do speak with passion at times). Today he is distant because I asked him last night if we could go to counseling and as a result he feels we are on the brink of divorce. I told him that all I want is true and genuine reconciliation and a deep connection with him. The conversation just centered around how I don\u2019t listen, that I\u2019m rude, and have a bad tone. He told me he is going to talk to a man he looks up to and when I asked if I could go with him, he said no. We agreed that I should go back to work and that we could just go 50/50 but he ultimately feels we are headed toward divorce. \n\nAny and all advice is welcome. Tell me where I am going wrong and what I can do on my end. \n\nTL;DR: my husband and I have had a rough marriage and when I asked to go to counseling he said no and feels our relationship is at the brink of divorce  ",

I've been married 13 years to my wife and together 15 and neither of us have ever called eachother names especially when times got bad. That was our number one rule when we got together no verbal or physical abuse of any kind. We are adults we can talk it out. Also we've always been a team wether struggling or not. We are better as a team then divided especially when facing the uncertain. You need a partner who is there for you through good and bad and pushes you to become the best version of yourself. \n\nSometimes enough is enough and you have to cut your losses. Even if he does go to counseling things might change for a few weeks then it's right back where you started trust me, I've been through it with my first ex wife.

I agree that you should go to counseling for yourself even if he doesn\u2019t join you. If he was at a minimum financially providing for you I could see something to hang on to. But the fact that a grown man is okay putting you and his child in a position to depend on the generosity of others for a place to live is a huge red flag. It sounds like he has a lot and I mean a lot of growing up to do. He will either rise to the occasion or he won\u2019t. It is not your responsibility to police a grown man. Always trust your gut.

I couldn\u2019t remember the website & it was something we had searched recently, so I went into his history. We are supposed to be on a social media hiatus, just because we spend way too much time on our phones, usually on a social site. While searching, I noticed that he had been on Facebook via web, not really a big deal as we were away and he had a lot of downtime. What did bother me though is that I noticed that he had been searching for a woman who had been a point of tension in our relationship several years before we got married. I thought there may have been a sexual relationship between them, but those feelings were never really justified & I couldn\u2019t prove it, so I dropped it and she hasn\u2019t come up in many years. The other thing that I noticed is that he was searching for a woman whom he appeared not to know the last name of - he looked at several profiles with the same first name but different last names. I clicked on the profiles for these women, and they were all very beautiful, either very curvy or very busty, which I am not and just very gorgeous. I don\u2019t typically have issues with jealousy, and I do trust my husband, I don\u2019t worry that he cheats, but seeing the search history really bugged me. I decided that I had no reason to question his loyalty, that it\u2019s OK for him to look up people from his past, and I decided to leave it alone.\n\nWell, then this morning my husband initiated sex, as he does many mornings, but while we were being intimate, he went soft inside me. On weekends when we\u2019re kid free & we\u2019ve been super sexually active, I have tired him out & this may happen, but it\u2019s rare and it really takes an entire weekend to tire him out. That was definitely not the case this weekend - we were surrounded desk by family, there was very little privacy. I tried really hard to be graceful about it, and not say anything, but I think he could tell that it bothered me. He masturbated a, got hard again & rolled me over and we tried again, but within a few minutes, he was soft again. And now I\u2019ve been sitting at work all day really questioning What the hell is going on with my husband. Why was he searching for those women? Am I not satisfying him anymore? Is it possible that he\u2019s cheating? I think I\u2019m just losing my mind but the more I think about it the more I start to spiral. It\u2019s completely possible that the searches and this morning\u2019s incident are not related so if I bring up the searches, I could come off as accusatory and if I bring up the AM incident, it could be really embarrassing for him, and I just don\u2019t know how to proceed\n\nTL;DR: husband went soft during sex, after I found him searching for random women on social media. Feeling a little insecure and not sure if I should question him about it",

So I would approach it as two separate instances.\n\nAs far as the online searching goes, you could absolutely say hey saw you searched on Facebook for these two gals what\u2019s going on and see what he says, or you could just leave it be and accept that maybe curiosity struck? Nothing more. \n\nOnly you know the tenor of your relationship. So if he is searching for women, and that is what you believe to be out of character, then definitely bring it up, but if you think it was just maybe curiosity, I would leave it alone for now.",

It's not necessarily related to the ED.   He's making it like he's not online on social media much.     You find out he is. And he's been searching  for some woman that he has some sort of inappropriate relationship with before.   It's not ok.  You have a right to be really upset.   He needs to be confronted",

He is likely not cheating from what you have said but what he may have done is masturbate too much recently and he suffered with you as a result.  \n\nI agree that confronting him would be bad because it could make him doubt himself.  He knows he went soft believe me.  Erections are as much mental as anything.  Try initiating with him again and see if he has an issue.  If so then instead of showing frustration, ask him if there is anything you can do.  You might also jokingly ask him if he has been masturbating too much thinking about you.  See if that seems to hit home. Not because thinking of you is funny but because if you say it that way it\u2019s not accusatory or pressure.",

That is the important thing to see here, then you will be more likely to get to some of the root issues. \n\nIt sounds like you have some insecurities about your appearance, beyond this indicating you are human it also likely means you don't invest enough time and energy into yourself. This could be your diet, fitness, clothing, or could have nothing to do with your appearance. If you don't have things going on in your life that make you feel like *you* it is going to be difficult to be comfortable and confident with what you see on the outside.\n\nMaybe there are some relationship issues. Possible you would like to see him put in more effort, take on more of the mental load and plan more, both in the mundane areas and for fun stuff. Maybe you are both failing the relationship and don't prioritize quality time together, instead doing to much family stuff as an example.\n\n  \nI'm not trying to justify your partner searching ex's, I'm actually trying to avoid judgement of that entirely and instead focus on things you can take from these two experiences that benefit you.",

I think I need to edit the post to add that we did not have sex while we were away with family, we did not have sex until we got home and we were alone in our room after an evening of rest. He initiated sex in the morning, already erect, no foreplay, just straight to work, and then lost his erection during sex. I guess this is where perspective comes in because where you are saying, \u201che got hard for me twice\u201d what it feels like to me is that he got or was hard, then turned to me for release, and went soft while inside of me, got himself hard again, turned to me again and then went soft again. THIS is the feeling I\u2019m struggling with. I can be understanding of age and other changes related to health, but what if he\u2019s wanting something else or just isn\u2019t enjoying sex with me anymore?! Which then led me to mentally revisit the searches I found over the weekend & wonder if they are part of this issue. The first woman he searched for - the known woman - is very similar to me as far as her build is concerned; If you compare her & I, you would say he has a type. I\u2019m not sure about the second woman he was searching for, I\u2019d never heard that name before & I don\u2019t even know if he found who he was looking for, all the profiles he looked at did have curvy women with the exact same first name, but they all had different last names. They definitely did NOT look like me. I want to say that we are usually pretty open and we\u2019ve spoken about exes from our past, but the idea that there\u2019s this new woman he\u2019s searching for that I\u2019ve never heard of really bothers me too.",

If he hadn\u2019t masturbated the 2nd time, he couldn\u2019t have gotten hard.\n\nSo unless you in to being woken & just jumping into PIV (no judgement if you like that and are aroused, I\u2019m saying if you don\u2019t like that) foreplay is masturbation to get girl wood called \u201ctenting.\u201d This is where the vagina elongates and opens more to accommodate a penis.\n\nSo do you like having sex that way? Cause if yes, cool. But if you\u2019re not cool with it, that should be addressed above ALL other things.\n\nAs far as looking at other women on social media, I think it\u2019s weird but as long as nothing is affecting me life, marriage, or sex I wouldn\u2019t really care.\n\nThe fact he\u2019s looking for a girl like you is good, I guess. All of my husband\u2019s celebrity crushes look and act like me. So I find it a bit of a compliment.\n\nHe also knows my types (I\u2019m not ans particular to have an official \u201ctype) and will freeze frame a movie so I can enjoy the view.\n\nBut your husband is doing this searches without you and I think that\u2019s partly problematic only because it seems to hurt you. We all like eye candy, but you seem to be viewing this as more, maybe approaching an infidelity level depending on your relationship rules and boundaries.\n\nSo you have to decide what your really made out and then absolutely have a conversation with him.",

There are loads of reasons why men become limp. \n     \n     My guess is he did masturbate while thinking of another.\n\n     You could question him about it, but do you really think he would own up to wanking to another lady? I don\u2019t! If he is jerking to another, doesn\u2019t mean that he is cheating, or that he has lost his love for you. He is probably going for variety? \n\n      If you have had an abundant ( for you both ) sex life and nothing has changed recently, I would think it\u2019s a variety thing. My thoughts are that guys instinctively want to like do it with everyone they can. This doesn\u2019t mean that he doesn\u2019t love you, it also doesn\u2019t mean he is cheating. Guys are just wired that way in my opinion.\n\n      I understand this could make you feel insecure.       TaLK to him about this .. maybe not his searches, but that you have been feeling insecure, and if he could help you with this?       I would also try doing different adventurous activities when you are having frisky time.\n\n      I wish you the best!",

        "text": "Turns out there was some missing information and miscommunication between my husband(26 trans M) and me(26 F).  I have been so confused about his friendship with this person and couldn't understand why he wanted to continue this friendship with everything I knew.  Apparently, my H hasn't been telling me all the information, just the bad stuff.  This, of course, gave me a warped perception of the friendship and any events that happened.  \n\nI can also accept that seeing my husband rely on Amanda for most of his emotional stability has been very hard for me.  He stated he wasn't trying to 'dump' all of his emotional baggage on me and was instead leaning on Amanda.  I told him how this made me feel and how I would prefer if he would confide in me over Amanda when possible. Allowing us to lean on each other as much as possible, given the distance. \n\nNow, this in no way excuses some of the behavior that Amanda has done to make my husband (and myself) uncomfortable. However, this continued friendship isn't a free-for-all like I had incorrectly assumed he was telling me.  It is simply continued communication via the restricted set of boundaries that we had previously agreed upon as a couple.  \n\nWould I prefer for the continued communication not to have restarted? Of course, however, I am holding space both for the information that I hadn't been told about her character and the traumatic event that they both went through.  I am trying to give her another chance to change my perception of her and lead with kindness.  \n\ntl;dr: I didn't understand that previous boundaries were still going to be in place.  I was primarily given the negative information regarding Amanda, which affected my perception of her.  I am giving grace and holding space for the peace of all those involved. ",

        "title": "Update - In absolute despair - 30 yrs married, wife had affair",
        "post-author": "EveryMind",
        "text": "Two days ago I made this cry for help [https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1koojpz/in\\_absolute\\_despair\\_30\\_yrs\\_married\\_wife\\_had\\_affair/](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1koojpz/in_absolute_despair_30_yrs_married_wife_had_affair/)\n\nToday I am posting the outcome at this time. I thought about just disappearing however I am posting this out of respect for the many people who gave their time and shared their own experience or provided their best advice to me, a stranger on the internet.\n\n**TDLR**\n\nMarried M(58) for 30 years to my life partner F(50) and found out she had been seeing another man for a few weeks after I discovered text messages. This destroyed me and I was suicidal. I could not see a future without my wife.\n\n**Marriageadvice subreddit**\n\nI posted in the subreddit out of shear desperation but I did not expect anything like the level of support I received, it was incredible. Not only did it help to know I was not alone in these difficulties, but the advice was on another level. Out of hundreds of responses only 1 PM was unacceptable. That's a hugely positive signal to noise ratio that I have never witnessed in a web discussion before. *I did not thank every single contributor individually but I read every single comment, most them more than once and I* ***thank you all***\\*, even the few that called me naive.\\*\n\n**The Update**\n\n*I was criticised for playing the \"pick me\" card.* This was fair. The exposure to the texts turned me from a confident and assured individual into a sobbing wreck pleading for forgiveness when I was not even the guilty party.\n\n*I was told to be strong and regain my self esteem, even if I had to fake it, otherwise I would be viewed as weak.*  This was perhaps some of the best advice and I accepted this fully. But I knew it would be so hard to fake my previous confidence levels when the spectre of life without my wife kept creeping out of the box and haunting me.\n\n*I was told I was naive.* In a way of course I was, I had no experience of this. But I also knew my wife. After 30+ years knowing someone you can tell a lie when a straight question is asked, and the answer comes quickly with eye to eye contact. I don't need to convince anyone here of this,  because I was convinced and that's all that matters. If I have got this wrong, I deserve the \"I told you so\" memo.\n\n**The Outcome**\n\nThe outcome I was seeking was resolution and staying together. The majority of comments pointed to the D word, told me to tool up and get ready for war. I could not face war, I could not face talking to a solicitor. I could not face checking our joint account to check she wasn't doing a smash and grab. I just wanted my wife back, my life back, and a future to look forward to.\n\nSo I took on board the commenters who said I needed to be firm, and if she still was unsure, to help her pack her bags.\n\nWe had a long talk and I went after every single detail of what had happened. I dug deep into matters I knew were involved but had not come to the surface. At times she looked at me with a cold emotionless face that I had never seen in 30 years, seriously, never seen - ever. That shook me to my core and I nearly folded.\n\nBut I stayed strong because I was not the one that broke the vow. And when I did not see absolute commitment to fixing this I did what I was advised in this sub - I was very clear on what would happen now. I raised my voice and said it was time to go pack your bags and move out. Even though this was my worst nightmare, I said it out loud. And I was shitting myself.\n\nIt was at that point she stated she wanted to work it out.\n\nWe had talked absolutely everything through. The exact circumstances had been revealed. The exact levels of betrayal were revealed. Skeletons had been pulled out of closets. This was now a wake up call and a fresh start.\n\n24 hours later and I can already feel the difference. It's night and day. A switch has been flicked.\n\nThis is the outcome I was seeking. A CHANCE to work though this and save what was worth saving. The alternative for me would have been devastating.\n\nI want to say thank you again. All opinions were valued, and I will be reading the suggested books and watching the suggested YT videos.\n\nTo anyone going through similar, I hope things work out for you because this is a brutal thing to have to suffer. To anyone who has already been through it and come out the other side, and shared your difficult experiences, thank you so much.\n\nThank you.\n\n(edited to correct dates)\n\ntl;dr There is hope - thank you so much redditors.",

The exact circumstances had been revealed. The exact levels of betrayal were revealed. Skeletons had been pulled out of closets. This was now a wake up call and a fresh start.\"***   \n\nThis is not a wake up call. This is not a fresh start. This is a panic mode reaction by her and nothing more. She realized you had, at least in words; the courage to throw her out of your life and not take her BS. Everything before you said pack your things was who she really was. Period. Then what she did and said after was purely reactionary and fear. \n\nYour marriage will might seem to get better. And for a while seem back on track. But there will be a point where she feels safe again. And then her choice options will come back up again. She did not have regret, remorse, or guilt before you made your stand. Most who really work out, have all the reactions your wife did after the threat of divorce, before it is made. So IDK if you should. But I know you feel you have to so I understand that. It can work out, but you need to keep her accountable for what she did and does going forward.",

But the best sign to know who cares about the mistake, can change, and will not cheat is how they react when it is discovered and such. She showed no remorse.

She could have spoken open and honestly about them, she could have asked for counseling, she could have separated from you- to name a few.\n\nBut instead, she chose to take a sword to fix a scalpel level problem. This is very common after the discovery of infidelity. The cheater points out all the things YOU DID TO MAKE THEM FUCK SOMEONE ELSE. The truth is they CHOSE to take the easy way out. \n\nWake up man. If you want to work it out, i completely get that! 100 I do! And good on you. HOWEVER, if she's been fucking another man and when caught she says 'sure but had you been better it wouldn't have happened' basically, THAT is not true remorse; that's being sorry you're caught. \n\nI know you don't want to go into detective mode but dude, you're gonna have to buck up here and not rely on her word. You MUST insure her actions are matching her words. The fact that she was ice cold until you asked her to leave is the single most telling thing about this whole situation.\n\nCheaters lie. Think of all the times she had to choose him at your peril. Cheating is not a single mistake. It's a series of choices designed to mislead you so they can be where and with whom they want to be. \n\nGood luck. But please don't just forgive and forget. You can never truly forgive until you know fully what it is that you're forgiving.",

I know people are giving you crap about staying & believing her, but I still don't think that, if this is what you want, that is reason enough to just throw it out. *You* will need to know that *you did everything you could* and you followed your values and your boundaries. \n\nSo you've done a great job of taking the advice in alignment with you and your character, and appreciating but discarding the advice that does not.

But if somebody has already betrayed your trust, they're really not in a position to deny that at least not in the beginning. I think it would be wise, because as you said these things can nag in the back of your mind, to come up with things that you know would help you believe her but also give you leeway to ask for things that she's not expecting. The reason I think this is if you say okay in order to trust you I'm going to need to xyz, if she was still going to betray you she might do it doing a, b and c and you wouldn't know. So phrasing it as I'm going to need to see X Y and Z but there may be additional things I will ask you to demonstrate and prove while we rebuild trust sets that expectation in advance.\n\nAnd then I would internally, not necessarily share with her but internally decide with yourself when is your check back. Where you will decide if you trust her. Maybe in the beginning you don't even think about it for a month like anything less than that is ridiculous to make a decision based off of. But it one month evaluate and think have I seen progress am I feeling a little better is her behavior earnest. Do the same thing at 2 months (or whatever feels right to you). I truthfully can't imagine this being shorter than a 6 month process at a minimum of these regular check-ins with yourself, but you may want to set a date now of if you don't feel a certain way by a certain time - 6 months 9 months a year whatever - you will have a reevaluation. You are of course free to revisit those dates at any time but I think setting those guardrails for yourself in advance could be really helpful to not let you just fall into the routine of improvement without actually evaluating if it's improving.",

It's possible she was unhappy for a long time and either didn\u2019t express it clearly or only hinted at it without open communication, but no meaningful or consistent changes have taken place. She may give reasons for what she did, but those need to be carefully considered and very rationally. Are they genuine, or are they being used to justify her actions? Another possibility is that she never fully valued the marriage and was simply looking for excitement. You know her best: is she grounded and thoughtful, or more superficial and impulsive? For sticking around for so long, i would say something must have being going on, maybe she has built years of resentment or she has changed and grown in a different direction.  Either way, this is a serious situation that shouldn't be taken lightly. I think counseling will be needed to identify the exact dynamics and whether things can be fixed at this point. It might be worth exploring whether she has shown narcissistic traits over the years. People with those tendencies often create deep emotional confusion and dependency, making it difficult for their partners to see things clearly or detach. Covert narcissism is often much harder to spot than the more obvious kind. This could help make sense of some of the emotional confusion and pain you're experiencing.",

If you're reading this mate change your mind and send her to the streets where she belongs. Yes it's tough but the fact is that during the conversation your wife dropped the facade and showed you who she is all along. She's now merely biding her time and more than likely this type of behaviour has been going on for more than a few weeks. Maybe not with the same man but quite possibly she has been this way your entire marriage. Run while you still can mate as she isn't going to stop she'll just get better at hiding it.",

It's not healthy to put so much importance on another person. Your wife can probably feel the weight of this and that's not good or healthy in any way. At the very least, find some things that make you happy outside of that of your wife. Good luck.",

        "text": "\nAs the title states can a marriage last or be sustainable if both partners libidos are mismatched? \n\nWithout going into too much detail about my personal situation, I consider myself hlm, wife is llf. For 2 years we have gone to MC, treated her hormones with HRT, have tried everything under the sun, yet wife still has no interest in sex or having any kind of intimacy. \n\nShe is routinely coming home from work or errands, essentially ignores me for 3 hours and then after we put the kids to sleep decides to start talking to me about things we have already talked about or transactions or things she needs to buy and then rolls over and falls asleep. I occasionally get blessed with handjobs when she realizes I\u2019ve been wanting some action or we\u2019ll rush a quickie in the shower in the morning before I take kids to school. \n\nI make plans for a date nite or to be intimate at nite and she\u2019ll come up with some errand she needs to do and then falls asleep after said errand is done. It\u2019s almost as if she purposely tries to avoid intimacy with me.\n\nI have explained to her how that makes me feel and that I need intimacy with her. And she\u2019ll\nMake another excuse about how stressed work makes her feel and that even though I feel what I get is bare minimum that I am lucky I am getting sex once a week or that I get handjobs. And I tell her I don\u2019t care about what others do or don\u2019t get I need to have intimacy with my wife. I tell her I want to please her but she tells me pleasing me pleases her. Yet she never wants to have the kind of passionate sex we had when we first were married. \n\nSo I am seeking advice, is this salvageable? Can partners coexist in a relationship if our libidos are mismatched? I am tired of feeling like a ghost in this relationship and have told her this. \n\nTl;dr: wife never wants to be intimate, have tried everything from MC to HRT. Wife seems like she is just happy being my roommate but I don\u2019t know how much longer I can take being a ghost in this relationship. ",

It's that she's avoiding physical intimacy (and probably emotional intimacy) and you have no idea why.  \n\nWhy did you quit going to marriage counseling?   Why not go back?    This isn't about sex.  It's about a relationship that needs a lot of work.   It's an unhealthy way of dealing with unresolved conflict.    It's a lack of emotional intimacy.    \n\nGo back to marriage counseling",

As I read your post, I can see you\u2019ve been making efforts\u2014counseling, hormone treatments, and planning time together\u2014which shows commitment. But one thing I noticed is that the focus is mostly on how *disconnected and undesired you feel* (which is valid), but not much about *how your wife might be feeling emotionally*.\n\nYou mention her being stressed from work, falling asleep early, or focusing on errands. These might seem like avoidance, but they could also be signs that she\u2019s emotionally depleted or disconnected in ways that aren\u2019t being fully acknowledged. You say you want to please her, but I didn\u2019t see much about asking *what* she needs\u2014emotionally, mentally, or physically\u2014to actually feel safe, loved, or in the mood for intimacy. That kind of emotional groundwork can make a huge difference, especially if her stress and low desire are tied to more than just physical factors.\n\nIt\u2019s not that your need for intimacy isn\u2019t valid\u2014it is. But sometimes, when one partner feels constantly measured or pressured around sex (even unintentionally), desire can start to shut down. Passion doesn\u2019t thrive in that environment\u2014it needs emotional safety, trust, and sometimes just feeling genuinely *seen*.\n\nYou\u2019re clearly yearning for closeness, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re selfish for that. But rebuilding intimacy might require a shift from \u201cHow do I get my needs met?\u201d to \u201cWhat would make her feel emotionally safe and connected again?\u201d That kind of curiosity might help you both move forward\u2014whether that\u2019s toward healing together or making decisions about the future with more clarity.",

If you both want regular sex, just with slightly different intervals (say one wants daily and one wants 2-3 times per week), it's a non-issue.  However, your situation can never really work.  You will always feel devalued and lost and hurt and frustrated.  She will always feel pressured and stressed.  \n\nThe question I have for you is do you want to live your one and only life with a woman who has no interest in you at all?",

She only communicates with me when she wants or needs something and I am so through with that. I have tried to be civil and patient with her. But it seems like she is content living her life her way. Whenever I do broach the subject it\u2019s always met with \u201cthat\u2019s all I think about\u201d \u201call I care about is sex\u201d so I stopped bringing it up.

That if i stopped trying she would stop trying to accommodate all completely. And my resentment would begin to build (which it has).

Could she be in perimenopause and it\u2019s medical issues making it worse? What does your marriage counselor say? I recommend that you set up a 1 on 1 session with the counselor and let that person know you\u2019re going to be initiating divorce soon if things don\u2019t change drastically.  That will I form the counselor that they need to change the tone of the counseling.  The counselor might even meet with her individually.  You\u2019re also going to have to have the consequences talk with your wife as well so she knows clearly what will happen if things don\u2019t change. \nHere is what she is doing, and it\u2019s common in these situations.  She doesn\u2019t want sex at all or rarely.  So she looks at it and convinces herself the way to prevent you from asking is to eliminate non sexual intimacy\u2026no hand holding, no hugs, no quick kisses, no flirting because any of that might make you want sex.  So that makes you resentful and feel unwanted and it makes her want sex even less. Sex is like anything else. The more you do it, the more you want it. The less you do it, the easier it is not to do it.  And physical intimacy impacts emotional intimacy and vice versa, so no non sexual intimacy or emotional closeness hurts you both.",

Which isn't a super long time but I just feel so exhausted trying to make things work. \n\nWe've been going to couples counseling since we've been dating and I talked to our therapist with and without my husband being present. \n\nWhat originally attracted me to him was his kindness, he would open doors for me and take me on dates and do gentleman like things. I never thought looks where too important. But now that the honeymoon phase has worn off I'm just not attracted to him physically.\n\nHe's still kind and nice but anytime he tries to touch me I find myself being repulsed or annoyed he's trying to touch me. Part of it has to do with telling him what I like and what I want in bed and he just completely ignores it. \n\nI could tell him and show him exactly what to do and he'll do it for 5 seconds and then stop. My libido used to be much higher, wanting like 3 times a week but by last year it's went down to once a week and now drastically to not at all. And it's not that I'm not in the mood, I'm just not in the mood for him. \n\nI feel bad for saying this but he's also gained a bit of weight since we got married which I know is normal but I just feel repulsed from his body and I'll try to work out with him and he says he wants to work out but once the time comes to actually go work out he won't go. \n\nI feel like I'm at my wits end and I'm unsure of i should keep trying to work things out or if I should just bite the bullet and divorce. \n\nI still love him and care about him but I don't want  to be in a sexless marriage and he shouldn't be forced to be in a sexless marriage either. \n\nTl;dr not attracted to my husband and unsure what to do.",

You\u2019re clearly trying to approach this with care and respect for your husband, which speaks volumes about your character.\n\nThere are a few important things you mentioned that really stood out: the ongoing counseling (kudos for sticking with it), your honest attempts to communicate your needs, and the emotional weight of being in a marriage that no longer feels fulfilling.\n\nOne point I\u2019d gently challenge is the idea of the \u201choneymoon phase\u201d ending as a cause for disconnection. While it\u2019s true that intense infatuation naturally shifts over time, attraction and intimacy can absolutely deepen with the right emotional, physical, and behavioral foundations. So rather than viewing attraction as something that simply fades, it might be more accurate to see it as something that evolves\u2014or diminishes\u2014based on how both partners nurture (or neglect) it.\n\nWhat you\u2019re describing sounds less like a natural decline and more like emotional and sexual needs going unmet for a long time. It\u2019s understandable that feeling unheard, especially in the bedroom, would erode your desire and connection. Physical appearance can matter to varying degrees for different people, but most often it\u2019s tied to the emotional experience. When someone consistently ignores your needs or lacks follow-through (like skipping workouts they said they\u2019d join you for), it\u2019s hard not to associate that with broader patterns of disengagement.\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right that neither of you should be stuck in a sexless marriage if that\u2019s not what you want. Love and care are not always enough to sustain a romantic partnership\u2014desire, communication, effort, and emotional safety are key.\n\nYou might ask yourself: *If nothing changes, how will I feel about this marriage in a year?* Sometimes we hold on hoping for change that deep down we know may not come. Only you can decide what\u2019s right, but please don\u2019t minimize your needs\u2014they\u2019re valid. And if you do decide to part ways, doing so with compassion may be the most loving thing you can both do.\n\nWhatever path you choose, I hope you find peace and happiness. You deserve that.",

Of course, some marriages end in divorce, that doesn't mean that both parties went into it with the right intentions. \n\nAm I missing something where? It is totally okay to go into a marriage promising monogamy and loyalty to your partner. The promise is valid **while they're your spouse**. If I promise to fetch my daughter every day from school, I will go fetch her. If she drops out, I'm not going to show up at the school at home time every day, expecting her to be there; I think she'll accept that my promise to fetch her no longer applies. So, *obviously* if you divorce, you no longer owe your ex-spouse loyalty or monogamy. Isn't this like really basic stuff? Someone make this make sense.",

There is a big line that I draw when it comes to him not being able to promise monogamy because a threesome could be in our future if that\u2019s what we both decide, versus him not being able to promise monogamy because he don\u2019t know if he\u2019s gonna want other women in general when he\u2019s married to me. Which is breaking our vows and our commitment to each other. Like I said in the post, he\u2019s a firm believer of I have no idea what\u2019s gonna happen in the future we all make our own decisions. But what I need to know to decide if I divorce him or not, is if he won\u2019t promise it because of us involving more fun in our marriage, which includes a threesome? Or if he just doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s gonna want other people in general. Because that is not the commitment that he made to me the day we got married. I thought a commitment was knowing that you\u2019ll want your wife and only your wife or your partner in general for as long as you both shall live. I\u2019m scared to bring it up to him because I feel like he\u2019s just gonna say I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen in the future. And that\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking. So hopefully you guys understand what I\u2019m asking and maybe you can put it in better format for me to relay to him. I just don\u2019t wanna go through this anymore. And if he doesn\u2019t know if in the future he\u2019s gonna want other women and he can\u2019t tell me why he can\u2019t promise monogamy, I don\u2019t want him anymore. And I don\u2019t want that in my life. No matter how much it breaks me. I\u2019m too young for this. All I want is for him to tell me he\u2019s committed to me. I don\u2019t care if he can\u2019t promise monogamy because of a threesome that is a fucking hypothetical me and him have already gotten past that part. It\u2019s just the part of him, not promising it because he might want another woman. Why is he even thinking like that? It\u2019s not about not knowing what will happen in the future. It\u2019s about knowing now. Right now, I can say that I\u2019m fully committed to him and although I do not know what\u2019s gonna happen in the future, what decisions I\u2019ll make. I can still tell him that I am gonna be faithful and committed to him for the rest of our lives because that is my plan right now.And I can\u2019t promise monogamy because of the fact that involving another person to have some fun in our marriage would be breaking that promise. I\u2019m not saying that I can\u2019t promise monogamy because I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m gonna want another guy those two things are very different I think.",

If anyone wants a threesome, they want another person - even if just sexually. So, in your hypothetical, if he were to ever want a threesome, that means he will want other women. He will want the threesome even if you don\u2019t , and he will expect you to be ok with it and please him- so it is not something he will want because he considers it a fun couple activity that you both enjoy, he will want it because he wants other women. If he\u2019s saying it as a hypothetical, he\u2019s probably just testing the waters and this is something he already wants and/or is doing - and even if it\u2019s not, you\u2019ve uncovered a fundamental difference between the two of you - you want monogamy, he \u201chypothetically\u201d does not.

Love and monogamy is rather a new concept, more common in Western culture, but is constantly evolving. There is a lot of published research and books on whether humans can be monogamous or how one can be deeply in love with a partner and still crave sexual variety, especially as our life expectancy increases greatly.

Unless the two of you are specifically in an open marriage and/or have needs you both agree should be met by people outside your relationship, monogamy should be the default in any marriage. Otherwise, what\u2019s the point?!\n\nThe whole \u201cforsaking all others\u201d bit means exactly that-not just forsaking those who might be looking to draw you into physical cheating, but anyone who seeks to intrude upon, manipulate or destroy your marriage, however that may be. \n\nYou should be able to trust your spouse to communicate issues they have within your relationship so you can fix them together, rather than just bottling it all up and running off to bang someone else. \n\nPeople make excuses and justifications for infidelity, but if you\u2019re married to the right person for the right reasons and are both working hard on communication, you shouldn\u2019t feel the need to cheat. \n\nIt all comes back to the fact that love isn\u2019t something you have, or are entitled to, it\u2019s something you *do*.

We moved here after getting married because she wanted to start a family, and her parents lived less than a mile away. Now, we have two young children in elementary school\u2014one in 3rd grade and the other in 1st.\n\nGiven how difficult the New York real estate market has become, we had previously decided to dormer and expand our current home. I had even started getting quotes from contractors. But about a week ago, she surprised me by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to dormer anymore\u2014I want us to seriously start looking for a new house in these towns.\u201d\n\nI responded, admittedly with some frustration, \u201cWhat changed your mind? I thought we were dormering. I\u2019ve been researching contractors and making plans. I don\u2019t want to move.\u201d\n\nShe explained that she no longer wants to stay in this area anymore  and would prefer to find a new home this summer so the kids can start at a new school in September\u2014even though we currently live in a highly rated school district.\n\nI told her that trying to make a move this fast would be incredibly stressful or nearly impossible with the market demand and lack of homes( she seems unswayed by that) . She also recently underwent major spinal surgery so much of this is going to fall on me . We have been arguing non stop about this.\n\ntl;dr wife decided last minute that she wants to move THIS summer. Causing major issues between us.",

        "text": "Hey everyone, I'm looking for advice on how to better manage my wife and I's sex life. We have a really great relationship other than this singular item that I would really like to resolve better between us. We have completed several marriage therapy sessions on this topic as well which has helped somewhat but it ends up being temporary. I have a relatively high sex drive (3 times a week preferably) while my wife is in the 1-3 times a month range. We have been together for 15 years and married for 9 years this year. We have two young children as well. A 3 year old and 5 year old. I'm still very attracted to her even though she has body self esteem challenges. Through our therapy sessions we have tried a red, yellow, green light system that has kinda worked. The ball is in her court through the week. If she isn't feeling it that night is red and we do nothing. Yellow is she can scratch my itch (handjob typically), green is sex. That system has worked some but I am very much a physical touch love language person while she is more acts of service. I do a ton of stuff around the house, dishes, clean, kids, all the lawn/house maintenance. Because of that, I would think it would fill her cup and increase her libido but it never does which confuses me. Because of my love language, I really want her to enjoy our intency as well but I think she just sees it as checking a box for me which I hate her to look at it like that. I think I'm just to the point where I just need to not take her turning me down personally and just take what I can get when I can get it and keep my mouth shut haha. Any suggestions are appreciated! \n\nTl;Dr\nWife and I have very different libidos and I'm looking for better ways to bridge the gap between us. ",

I would argue there is very little difference. You don't want duty/pity sex but unfortunately you have spent a lot of time advocating for just that, and then accepting it when it is offered which only solidifies the idea duty/pity sex is cool with you... which is certainly hurting your relationship.\n\nYou need to quit advocating for things you don't actually want, and even more important don't get frustrated if you don't get something that you never actually wanted. When I say this hurts the relationship I mean the relationship as a whole, not just your sex life. You are at times saying one thing but doing something different.\n\n>\u00a0I do a ton of stuff around the house, dishes, clean, kids, all the lawn/house maintenance. Because of that, I would think it would fill her cup and increase her libido but it never does which confuses me.\n\n1. What about you doing more housework makes you more interesting and desirable as a sexual partner, or even just as someone to spend time with?\n2. You are still looking at things transactionally, meaning you are trying to earn sex, which is treating it as duty/pity sex.\n3. When you talk about filling her cup you are talking about companionate love. Giving her warm and fuzzy feelings and reducing her stress are not at all the same as getting her hot and bothered. At best you will reduce potential turnoffs, which will make it more likely for her desire to grow, but desire comes from reduced inhibitions AND increased arousal. At worst you are doing a lot to show her you are just a companion, if that is that is the only side of you she sees that isn't going to spark her interest.\n\nYour wife lacks interest in you, and instead of going out and being more interesting you started doing more housework.",

I think it can be easy for men to not fully understand the mental load women feel especially if they are caring for children. From your perspective she might have not done much on a particular day, and you might have done most of the work, but in her head she\u2019s swimming with all the things she needs to do and doesn\u2019t have energy for. \n\nI think marriage counseling is a great idea. \n\nSomething my husband and tried was a candle. We picked a specific color (red) and my husband would light the red candle when he needed sex (not just wanted but was to a point where it was really really important to him). I would then take some time and contemplate if that was something I could I do for him. Maybe I needed a shower, a break from the kids, the dishes to be done, a massage before sex - whatever. If I could \u201csnap out of my mood\u201d if XYZ thing happened then I would communicate those needs so he could help me with them. Sometimes I just needed time and a bit of help. If I I really really could not make the request happen that night, the deal was we would the next night, and I would communicate what I needed in the short term to make that happen the next day. \n\nHowever, the candle thing was established on a NEEDS basis, not a whim. So think like once per week maybe once per 2 weeks.\n\nEdit: The candle thing worked well for us, it was a low pressure way of communicating. I was alerted to his needs in a subtle way and I had opportunity to think about what I needed in order to feel in the mood. I liked this option because it was easy for me to just \u201csay no\u201d or \u201cred card\u201d him. With him asking I was able to soften my heart a bit because I understood the importance and I truly wanted to fulfill that desire because I love him. So it was on me to communicate what I needed to be able to do that. But what was needed from him was respect and understanding. Just because he lit the candle doesn\u2019t mean it was happening that night and he couldn\u2019t light it more than once a week.",

This is a technique you can practice that will teach you discipline and it\u2019s also a benefit to find out who and what you married. This is going to boost your stamina and your confidence and you\u2019ll find yourself being more focused on your job, on working out and everything you need or that you\u2019re lacking. Including the way you feel about yourself. If you\u2019re already in good shape, this is going to be healthier for you and when you feel like you\u2019re weak, you need to understand that you can give yourself your own handjob. Semen retention. \nI hear what you\u2019re doing. You say you\u2019re a very sexual person but 3x a week is normal. That\u2019s a regular sex life. That means you married your type and you take care of her and your family and do all of the things you\u2019re supposed to do. And you\u2019re showing her the level of discipline you have. \nLet\u2019s see how many months she\u2019ll go without sex. 1 month then 2 months. Then she\u2019ll probably try and gaslight you and accuse you of cheating or something when you don\u2019t make the attempt to have sex with her after a few months. I suspect that she\u2019s interested in someone else. \nI\u2019m sure in the beginning she gave you all the sex you wanted before you were married. Now it\u2019s all transactional, you pay the bills, you handle the kids and the chores and maybe she\u2019ll throw up a bat signal to show you how annoyed she is, not if she wants sex. That\u2019s what that stupid red, yellow and green system is at. \nYou need to train yourself and look at yourself like you\u2019re good enough for this woman or any other woman to deserve to have all of your needs met. \nShe knows that you won\u2019t press it and the therapist won\u2019t press it if she says it\u2019s her body issues that\u2019s the problem. And what kind of monster would go against that!? It\u2019s all manipulation and bs. \n\nSuper painful and hard truth here:\n\nYou\u2019re at the point of divorce. She is having sex with someone else. You don\u2019t have to say this. I\u2019ll say it for you. Get your finances in order. See what apartments you can afford with 50% of your income cuz you\u2019re at divorces door. Start thinking about 50/50 custody of your kids. Let me tell you something as a woman. The last thing to go is sex. Once that goes, the relationship is done. She\u2019s already taken this from you. Are you even sleeping in the same room? You\u2019re not getting your needs met. You\u2019re only talking about the sexual side. If she doesn\u2019t want to have sex with you, she doesn\u2019t want to talk to you. She\u2019ll have sex 1x a week, even 3x a week, she just won\u2019t do it for you. You\u2019re not it. You\u2019re a slave boy to her. A maid. You\u2019re not the hero in the movie, you\u2019re the sidekick. She wants to have sex with Superman not clark Kent. Lois walked right past Clark all the time even with him feeding her stories and bringing her coffee and being nice to her. The normal nice guy routine. And she looked right past him. She wanted the man everyone wanted. This. is. women. This is how we are. If you were to leave, there would be someone else she would be having sex with, no questions asked, body issues and all. \nShe will just have sex with the lights off or with a t-shirt on, she just doesn\u2019t want you to touch her. She doesn\u2019t want you anymore. \nSemen retention will help you have a clear mind. She doesn\u2019t want you and there\u2019s probably another man she does want. \n\nI promise you that I\u2019m not trying to make a sale here but I promise you if you order our book, you\u2019ll get a lot of answers. We talk about all the things you\u2019re going through and we\u2019ve helped quite a few men and women who are struggling in their relationships to get answers that your partner won\u2019t give you. Within 7 days of finishing this book you will identify key problems in your marriage that she is not admitting to you. It has nothing to do with her body. \n\nThis is the link to the audiobook: https://thebedellstandard.com/products/men-and-women-cant-be-friends-loves-blind-spot-formerly-a-guide-to-cheating-audiobook\n\nThis is the link to the ebook: https://thebedellstandard.com/products/men-and-women-cant-be-friends-loves-blind-volume-1\n\nHere\u2019s my TikTok info: https://www.tiktok.com/@marriedtomelanin?_t=ZT-8wavNdXeo0s&_r=1\nIf you don\u2019t want to buy the book, listen to some of the things I\u2019m talking about.

He has been in the military since we have been together but did not have to deploy due to his long training up until about 2 years ago and another one is coming up. \n\nHe deployed 1 month after our wedding. \n\nHis first deployment we got spoiled and could talk on the phone ALMOST every day. We could text whenever we wanted for the most part and that made some time go by pretty fast.\n\n  \nThis next deployment has taken a toll on me and he hasnt even deployed yet. Anyone who knows a boat deployment knows they have \"workups\" which basically are mini deployements leading up to the long deployment. Essentially training drills but they last 2 weeks to a month. So after workups and deployement your spouse can pretty much be gone for over a year. \n\nOn this deployment there is no interet and when they do have internet it hardly works. Half the time you don't know if emails are going through. The other half of the time they shut off any communication due to drills they're running and security. \n\n  \nI get a few emails a week and this is not for a lack of my husband trying. \n\n  \nMy husband will reach out whenever he can. He is great at communication its just quite literally not possible for him to communicate with me more. They have one computer they all share to email their spouses WHEN the internet is actually up. \n\n  \nI hate it. I hate emailing our life. How are you supposed to fit your entire day/week into one email. How are you supposed to show you care to hear about each others week? I sit in front of my screen and think about how stupid it is I have to email my freaking husband a recap of my week. \n\nI dont want to share exciting things because that feels dumb to type out in an email and I dont want to share any frustrations or bad things that happen in my week because then I feel bad wasting my one email on that. \n\n  \nSometimes it's easier when we just dont talk. I feel guilty saying that but its hard to go back and forth for two emails and then it just stops and then I don't hear from him and I am sitting here wondering if he is okay.   \n  \nIt's exhasuting and it seems unfair that with all the technology in the world that they cant get them better internet. I am angry (not at him) but I know he can sense it in my emails that I just dont care to sit there and write about my week to someone who I should be able to sit down and talk with every night at dinner.  I really dont know how I am going to do 7+ months of this on his actual deployment. \n\n I don't want to be so negative about this I know years ago people literally had to write letters but I even think that would be easier. I also hate to say it but sometimes I hate hearing about his work because it takes away from any conversation we can have but pretty much all he is doing while he is gone is working so I guess there is nothing else to talk about. \n\nI guess Im not even really sure what I am asking. Advice on how to communicate this way? How to stop being angry that this is how I get to talk to my husband for the next 8 months? \n\n**TL;DR**\n\nMy husband is about to deploy again, and unlike last time, we\u2019ll barely be able to communicate\u2014just a few unreliable emails a week. It\u2019s frustrating and exhausting trying to squeeze my life into one message, and I hate how disconnected it makes me feel. I\u2019m not mad at him, just the situation, but I know he can feel my frustration. I\u2019m struggling with how to cope and communicate like this for the next 7+ months.",

You need to adjust. \n\nSend him positive messages at least 5 out of 6 times. You married a military dude. Make some wife friends and build your support system. You are both sacrificing for our country. I thank you and all military families for your sacrifice. Stand by your man, in this situation.",

He was shipped off in the 2nd deployment out after it happened. \n\nYou have to learn to have a whole separate life. My husband lived for the emails and our 1 weekly phone call if we were lucky. He was Special Ops, so I never knew if we would actually get that call or not.\nYour husband will want to know everything going on in your life. It helps to keep him connected. At least, mine did. \n\nWork and friends are the key. Military spouses are the best kind of friends because they get the struggles. Find hobbies you can pour yourself into. \n\nI didn't know when or if my husband was ever coming home. Thankfully, he did, but he was forever a different man. Military life is hard, there is nothing else like it. If you can survive his time in the service, there is nothing you can't overcome. \n\nBest of luck!",

I wish I had some advice but someone else said it best - not to try to catch him up so much but maybe keep things light and conversational? Like think of a news piece and give your opinion on the subject (if that\u2019s your thing) or discuss plans for when he\u2019s back home (\u201cI think it would be nice to do x,y,z.

Wish we had read the book before that!\n\nAlso speaking to what someone else said, I wouldn\u2019t try to catch him up regularly. As a military spouse (as much as this reality sucks), you have to adjust to doing daily life without the person there. I\u2019d switch into a totally different groove when he was gone and felt much happier when there wasn\u2019t constant pressure to keep him in the \u201cloop\u201d about each daily detail. I totally hear you on the sometimes it felt easier to just not have the pressure to talk. \n\nSpeaking from the other side, it\u2019s much harder to be the one didn\u2019t leave. Sounds like he\u2019s trying but doesn\u2019t make it any less difficult :/ \n\nLastly, I used a journaling app called day one. You can upload pictures, write, and I think even voice memos. I personally am a big picture taker so I did my best to upload a photo daily and write a little something. Some days it was long text and other days it was just a picture of what I ate for breakfast. Best part is you can export it all as a pdf. Maybe if you did that and then sent it periodically via email, it\u2019d feel less like a task to figure out what to say when you go to write an email and check in. Then he can view/read as possible.\n\nHope this helps some! It\u2019s a hard life! You have to look out for your own mental health too so don\u2019t feel guilty about finding what works for you guys vs just accepting \u2018that\u2019s what you signed up for\u2019!",

        "text": "My husband (37M) and I (34F) have been together for 15years and married for 10 years. My husband and I both work full time jobs and he does have overtime hours each week but it varies. We have three kids (14, 12, and 4) and the older twos schedules keep us very busy during the week and on weekends. \nWe still have date nights and enjoy our time together. We laugh and joke around and enjoy conversation together. \nNow here's the problem. My husband doesn't seem interested in me sexually. It feels like our relationship is just two friends going through daily life together. He doesn't make me feel wanted. He will kiss me or be affectionate if I initiate but if I don't then he doesn't do anything at all or the most I get is holding hands. \nWe still have sex 1-2x a week but I always have to initiate and he doesn't seem to be as enthused in it or as enthused in me as he used to be.\nI've tried talking to him and he says he still finds be attractive but it's hard for me to believe it when his actions don't show it. It's starting to affect my self-esteem and confidence. \n\nHe did have his testosterone tested and he is slightly low. Doctor wanted to start him on a med for low testosterone but insurance issues have delayed it. Since that has happened my husband hasn't reached out to his doctor or taken any steps to fix the situation. \n\nI'm not even sure what I'm looking for here. I know our issues more than likely stem from his low testosterone but at the same time I can't help but feel so down about myself. I feel invisible to him. Not sure how to make things better when he doesn't seem to think it's a problem. \n\ntl;dr husband doesn't seem sexually interested or attracted to me outside the bedroom. ",

I recommend Clomid because it makes your body produce testosterone naturally and is a once-a-day pill. \n\nNext, I suggest reconnecting through regular deep conversations, date nights (especially when you both can laugh), weekend getaways, trips together, etc. Play couples games.\n\nContinue to initiate. If there\u2019s something he likes or wants, consider trying it. Have regular conversations about sex outside the bedroom. Discuss things like fantasies, role playing, kinks, lingerie, lube, toys, likes/dislikes, concerns, needs, and wants. \n\nI suggest going to an adult shop and shop together for toys and lingerie and accessories. Merely looking at those things can spark enthusiasm and discussion. You might find something you want to try. \n\nThe last suggestion is your first step. Communication.

Me (20)and my girlfriend(19) who I want to end up being my wife, have been together for a year and a half and for about the last 2-3 weeks I\u2019ve felt a sense of impending doom like I\u2019ve felt in my past relationships when I feel like they are coming to an end. This all started when she started hanging out with a friend she\u2019s known pretty much her whole life, he\u2019s just recently came into the picture because her family and his family have started to work together. But they\u2019ve started hanging out more frequently and texting a lot more but she seems happier when she\u2019s hanging out with him. I know this sound clich\u00e9 but me and her have talked about it and she told me that I have no reason to worry about him because he\u2019s (family)but I\u2019ve asked her just to tell me when they hangout or if he just stops by for a minute or even if they call, but that leads me to my next point, the other night she texted and told me that he\u2019d called her to rant about his race we just came from that was perfectly fine with me, but time went on and an hour and a half went by and then she finally calls me and doesn\u2019t really say a word about whatever they just talked about and almost immediately goes to sleep that\u2019s what got me. I feel like I\u2019m trying to self sabotage and looking to far into things because she\u2019s being cooperative with me when I asked her just to give me a heads up about him and reassured me that he and his family are (her family too) and that I have nothing to worry about when it comes to him. But I feel like I\u2019m loosing her, I\u2019m so madly in love with her that I don\u2019t know what I would do if I were to loose her, I just need some advice on if I\u2019m just looking to far into things or if I\u2019m being over bearing with her. \n\n\nTl;dr\nNeeding advice about what to do about my girlfriend and her friend and need to see if I\u2019m being over bearing.",

If you see yourself marrying her, then you may want to change your mind set for the long haul. Just because something is an issue now, doesn\u2019t mean it always will be. Her talking to this guy could very well sizzle out in the next few months when the excitement of the reconnect fades. \n\nDon\u2019t base a relationship off the past few months because you feel a little sad or back-burnered. As long as she\u2019s telling you the truth, and cooperating with the boundaries you are advocating for - then you have nothing to worry about and you need to ride through with your feelings until things naturally balance out again.",

Last may he got ED pills and I told him I was excited about those, and he said he was too.  I got nothing from them, NOTHING... he took them thru November,  daily thru HIMS. Every time I tried to advance on him I got turned down.  And he never tried with me at all during that time.  \nThis is not the first time he's had a \"crush\" as he calls it with someone he works with, sees a lot, and was texting to the point she said she loved him and was begging him to be with her because she knew he was miserable.  He apparently broke up with her before I found the texts, but the gist of it was that he said he would be her biggest fan and supporter and told her to \"walk away for awhile.'  \nSince I found out, there's been very little communication about the entire thing, he promised we would work on us with date nights, but absolutely REFUSES to go to marriage counseling because he knows he's \"a piece of shit.\"  We've had zero date nights or had canceled just going to dinner a few times which clearly weren't a planned date. \nI can't text him to talk when he is at work, he listens request,  and at home when I brought it up I was \"ruining\" HIS day off, even though I was also off.  I feel trapped with these stipulations,  especially since he had always told the older boys they could text him at work anytime, but I can't?

He was always watching porn, would always be watching girls on tiktok checking them out, even if i was sleeping beside him. One time, I even caught him watching a livestream of a female while on a video call with me. I know, I must be stupid for not leaving, I considered, trust me, I just can\u2019t seem to do it.\n\nWe talked about it, I set my boundaries, told them that the things he does were not ok with me. After a few months of him, trying to change he has \u2018successfully\u2019 stopped those things. However, I have noticed that since he stopped watching, he also stopped asking me to do things over on a video call or send him pictures or videos like he used to. \n\nThis made me hurt, I used to cry about him lusting over girls on the internet almost weekly, sometimes even twice a week. I would cry and tell him that made me feel unwanted. Sure, he\u2019s gotten rid of that habit but now, he\u2019s making me feel unwated by not wanting to do the things we used to do. We discussed it and he told me he\u2019d make it up to me. \n\nA few days later, he asked if we could do it over video call. During our time, I can\u2019t help but notice that he can\u2019t stay hard. This got me out of the mood. We got into an argument. \n\nNow, I don\u2019t know if I should apologize for reacting the way I did. I want to talk with him but I am afraid he might feel like I am attacking him. What should I do? \n\ntl;dr husband used to get off porn before, but can\u2019t stay hard for me now\n\n",

There's a lot of factors.\n\nHis porn usage obviously crossed a boundary for you which is part of the discussion, but all I'll say, from someone who struggles with performance, is try to be gentle with him about the issue. It is a deeply shameful and embarrassing thing to have happen and if he feels like you are angry or upset at him for his inability to perform, he will likely withdraw and shutdown because it's a very sensitive topic.\n\nIf his inability to perform is a direct result of porn over-consumption, that's a topic to discuss, and you are totally within your rights to be upset about that, especially if it is directly affecting your sex life. But I would strongly recommend not making him feel bad about not staying hard, because again, it's something that is deeply upsetting and sometimes inevitable as men age. They may be separate issues, they may not. Ultimately it need to be handled with tact",

Remember, he was asking you to do these things when he was engaging in unhealthy habits. Does your husband go to SAA meetings? Therapy? True recovery starts there. You guys have to build your intimacy back and that can take a while. I would also encourage you to seek therapy to help you deal with this as well.

It's lazy.  It trains the mind to only get aroused at certain images or body types.

There are a TON of things can cause fluctations in this.  Age, t-levels, high blood pressure (especially this!) and HBP medicine.  Also, porn keeps libido artifiically inflate. He should look into maybe getting some viagra, it's incredibly cheap online now through things like Roman health, or \"Hims\" where they mail it to you, and you should stop using the strength of his erection as a baraometer for how much he loves you. Doing so will only stress him out and cause further issues.  \n\nNext steps:\n\n1. Go to dr, get T levels checked and checked for HBP  \n2.  sign up for Hims and Roman health and get something like cialis or  viagra. This make sex so much more fun  \n3. Hit the weights to increase T levels naturally.   \n4. Take the pressure off of him and stop making this about you.",

        "text": "Me 'F50' and hubby 'M50' have been married 17 years. He has been talking to a married woman 'F35' at work who texted and said she loves him and was begging him to go be with her, because she knew he was 'miserable. '  obviously this has been going on awhile, and she questioned him as to 'why?' (I presume why he broke up with her), he said he couldn't explain it himself.  WHAT does that even mean??  This was not his regular partner also.\nWhen confronted, he said 'it was a crush'... that's all I got. \n\nHe refuses to go to marriage counseling (obviously red flag) saying we will have dates and work on it together,  that was almost 8 months ago and no dates. Also no sex, even though last may he bought daily pills for sex purposes.  I tried initiating a couple times and got blown off.  \n\n\nHe told the lady's husband he was a girl when he found out about the texts, said he 'didn't want to get involved in their stuff.'\n\n\nNot sure how to tell him we should just divorce, as I can't get past this.  this is number 2 that I know of.... he lied to me about the first one and said it was his 'M48' who lives out of state, friend's number and the friend got a new phone. At that time, he also told me he had nothing to hide. \n\n\nHe won't tell me the truth about either one. He acts like this is normal behavior,  and he never offered any apologies unless I asked him to, and then it was just 'sorry.'\n\nHe said this last time was because I hurt his feelings when I 'professed my love for an old bf' I hadn't seen in 35 years. That was 2 years ago and I do not even know anything about him besides from 35 years ago. It was a dream i had where I said it, which my hubby apparently forgot that part.  I tried to explain the dream to him but he takes it as truth because I was tipsy and 'alcohol is a truth serum.'  \n\nSo instead of discussing it with me, he turns to a woman at work? And he wouldn't tell me her last name, only that one guessed it incorrectly.  And she apparently won't tell her husband who is sending texts to her. They are both covering for each other. \n\nI tired to explain to him about the dream not meaning anything because I can have love for many people, but it's a different kind of love than he gets because it's not intimate like we have.  \n\nHe got upset one time that I talked to the neighbors about a few things and asked why I can't leave stuff at home... it was really nothing significant except about a trip we planned, and the calendar, and the neighbors took it out of course text and told him I was complaining about the 1 day conflict  with summer school.  So I asked him why couldn't he leave our stuff home and not take it to work? He didn't have an answer for it. \n\nI don't have proof that he actually did have sex with these women, but I believe the pills say it all.  I really think there's been more than 2. So many other signs in the past. \n\nWith the one 10 years ago he got upset that I went to his work and 'surprise visited' him after it all came out.  So essentially every woman in town could go see him at work but his own wife can't?\n\n\nDo I suck it up and end us? I feel so betrayed and like he has double standards.  I feel like he doesnt value us enough to tell me the truth. It's been 8 months and no date nights, if i bring it up, he wonders why I'm  still upset about it...  He will be super upset, but offered separation with this last one. First one he asked if I wanted divorced,  obviously I said no. I can't get the truth out of him, he won't tell me.  \n\nNo date nights since he said we would do that.  Things are good when he makes me laugh, then i feel like we're good too.  He seems to want to make things work but it's like the subject got totally ignored beyond his \"crush\" explanation.  \n\nTL;DR: husband has developed 2 ( that I know if) intimate relationships with women at his work over the past 10 years. Recently got Hims for ED but no sex with me. He refused to go to marriage counseling because he knows he's 'a jerk.''  \n\n\n",

We've had problems throughout the years that felt pretty significant but I stayed because I thought marriage was just hard. We've had years of conversations on how to save our marriage, me saying I was miserable, asking for marriage counseling, laying everything out that I needed, asking him to read some marriage books I liked, etc. he withdrew almost completely. Just found out this last week that he and my father have been discussing how best to \"handle\" me for over a year. My father has been praising what a great husband he is to me and telling him that I just have \"issues\". He's convinced that I'm bipolar and narcissistic and has been encouraging my husband to get me admitted and medicated. He's encouraged my husband to fully control me, not let me go anywhere without the kids, and withdrawal so I come crawling back, among other things. My father has always been manipulative and I believe my husband when he says that he was being manipulated, but I feel so betrayed. I don't feel like I can forgive anything else.

One person may have real concerns, while the other gets defensive due to past shit or inability to see the other wise. Sounds like his dad is manipulative and controlling (or that's what I'm reading from your post) and your husband has a hard time breaking from that either because of trust issues or something else. My husband and I are going through therapy right now (only three sessions in), and he gets very defensive even if I'm crying or really upset about something, but he's also trying to work through emotional issues himself (I believe stemming from learned behaviors from his dad, who was emotionally neglectful to his mom). He is otherwise can be very sweet, very helpful at home, and is a wonderful father. We just have some major communication breakdowns that need to be fixed. \n\nSounds like it would be really good if you both continued to go to therapy. And would be good if he started going. Therapy takes a while for some issues to come out - it's not going to happen after only two visits (not likely anyway). You are his wife, your disputes need to occur between you two, not between you, him, and his dad. Just some initial thoughts from a stranger...",

Then I'd definitely have a serious talk with your husband (and if you're comfortable, with your dad.

Express how you feel about your father, maybe even try to put some distance between your dad and your husband (or both of you). Your husband may be trying to keep the peace with your dad, or prove something to him? But overall, it sounds like you're both working on stuff. Maybe just give it time, lots of communicating, and really try to eliminate your dad from any aspects regarding your marriage. But gosh, I'm sorry, that's tough.\n\n  \nEdit: I see from your other comment you cut your dad off. Good for you, though again, I'm sorry. That sucks. That must be really hard for you.",

        "text": "UPDATE: I\u2019m an idiot, tonight we had great sex and I told him I wanted to grab my vibrator, he enthusiastically said \u201cyeah do it! Do you want to use it before or during, or both?\u201d \u2026 y\u2019all I\u2019ve been the problem this whole time. Three orgasms tonight lol and one sans vibrator even. Thanks to those of you who helped get me out of my own head.\n\n\nI\u2019ll just jump right in - it\u2019s difficult for me (33F) to orgasm without using a vibrator, and I rarely orgasm during foreplay or sex with my partner (38M) because we don\u2019t use one. We\u2019ve been together for over 10 years for context.\n\nI have vibrators and we\u2019ve used them during sex a handful of times before and YAY orgasm for me, but two problems:\n\n1) I don\u2019t feel comfortable pulling out the vibrator unless I\u2019m pretty drunk. I feel embarrassed that I need it and afraid to hurt my partners feelings, which is stupid but it\u2019s been hard for me to get over.\n\n2) my partner doesn\u2019t seem to really care that I almost never orgasm? Which honestly really upsets me more than anything else.\n\nHe\u2019s told me he doesn\u2019t care if we use the vibrator when I\u2019ve talked with him about it, but he also doesn\u2019t seem bothered if we don\u2019t use it and I don\u2019t cum. I know I need to be more proactive about my own pleasure and get over my needless embarrassment, but I also wish he outwardly cared more about my pleasure. I don\u2019t know if maybe he really does feel \u201cinadequate\u201d so he just pretends there\u2019s no issue, or what the deal is.\n\nSo advice needed on: is my partner an asshole for this? And how can I get more comfortable bringing the vibrator into the mix? I\u2019m so over this issue and I want to enjoy sex as much as I know I could be.\n\nTL;DR: I need a vibrator to orgasm with sex, partner doesn\u2019t seem to care.",

Have an open and honest conversation with your husband and tell him what you just wrote in this post. Let him know how you feel, just don't make it seem like you're upset at him, attacking him or nagging him. Just be honest and tell him you wanna finish too and then go ahead and teach him how to use it on you how you like. Boom problem solved lol or should I say buzz buzz buzz, problem solved.",

I think you aren\u2019t communicating the problem.\n\nYou are 100% responsible for your own orgasms and your partner has only a little control over whether you can or not. Women have to be in the right headspace, warmed up and touched in a certain way that seems to change every single time. \n\nMy wife orgasms far more often than not, and it\u2019s not that I am some kind of stud. I am certainly attentive. But she actually communicates like an adult with useful information when we talk about sex outside of the bedroom and while we are having sex.\n\nThings like \u201cI really want/need clitoral stimulation to orgasm,\u201d or \u201ca little to the right/left.\u201d \u201c A little harder/softer,\u201d \u201cslower/faster,\u201d and especially \u201ckeep going.\u201d\nWe don\u2019t read minds and we assume we are making you happy until you explicitly tell us we aren\u2019t. We don\u2019t know how close you are and if we need to keep doing what we are doing or switch it up.\n\nMen\u2019s orgasms are much different. They are more mechanical and consistent. What works once usually works always. Women tend to stay silent, or even worse, fake orgasms. That\u2019s bad information to work off of. Men see porn and the \u201corgasms\u201d so they think that jackhammering is what works because they get bad information. Sometimes a woman actually likes getting jackhammered but you told  the guy you didn\u2019t like that the last time he did that.\n\nCommunication, communication and communication.\n\nHealthy relationships are built on mutual respect, healthy Communication, and the desire to please each other.",

I am 32 yrs old (F) with 2 kids.\n\nThis past 6months we always have a fight cause he always going alone to the city, every time his off days at work, he always go to the city and convincing and manipulating my mind to just let him go and enjoy cause of too much stress at work, he said he just want to go for a drink and forgot the stress and promised me no girls, he even travel alone to Thailand knowing that I am so sick that time. But he still choose to travel. I still forgive him when he arrived to home cause I love him. I did everything to him I even drop him to bar and pick him up,\n\nAnd yesterday I discover everything. He left hos phone open, for my curiosity I open hos chat messages and boom. I found out he is cheating on me, meeting girls and even lady boys. He is paying them to have pleasure. I found out also when he travel to thailand while I am sick, he is there enjoying his self with girls and lady boy. Even here in our country home. I found out he is paying lady boys and girl. I really need your genuine advice. Iam confused of staying in our marriage or stay away from the marriage.\n\nHe is good provider, I dont have any complaints on that. Almost all his salary he is sending to me, but other than that .. nothing, he dont spend a lot of time with our kids, during his day off he spend it outside , drinking. He is not making an effort anymore for our family. He dont take us outside and at least sit with us. After his work, he just stay inside the room eat and play video games.\n\ntl;dr So now, I really need someone who have same problem.. and can advice me what is the best thing to do. I am also thinking of my kids well being, I dont want them grow up and have a broken family, especially O have 2 boys, I know there is always a bad impact.

        "text": "Not sure if this is the right sub to ask this but let's go..\n\nSo around Nov last year I met a guy in a chat room here for seeking friends. I'm in the UK he's in US. We messaged a little and I told him I was married with kids; he said he was single. I told him I wanted to meet new people and make friends and he said 'same!'\n\nGreat! Anyway, after a while messages went from funny to flirty (from him) but it was pretty light-hearted and I would mention my husband and he would rein it in.. he did initially respect my boundaries so there wasn't ever anything too explicit discussed etc but pics were exchanged (SFW) and a couple of phone calls.\n\nIn selfies he sent I would point out things in the background that made it seem like there was a female living with him but he always doubled down and denied it, giving me plausible explanations (other family members visiting etc).\n\nWe chatted almost daily for a couple months and got on like a house on fire. There was clearly an attraction developing (not necessarily romantic but just a deeper connection) and I told him I feel conflicted (doesn't help that I have a very difficult marriage and was not emotionally validated at home) and I wasn't sure where his boundaries where.\n\nHe replied wistfully that if circumstances were different, ie. I wasn't married, then he would definitely want more. He got cheekier with his flirting too and on a couple of occasions the dialogue was more than I was okay with, and so were the selfies he shared. He also said he doesn't really have a line that we can't cross so it's up to me where I define the end of the friendzone.\n\nBy the time January rolled around (couple months in total) I decided this wasn't right and was starting to weaken my resolve to stay at a friendly distance, and also decided that this felt like cheating on my husband. So I said my goodbye and cut contact. He said he understands and respects my decision.\n\nThere was no communication for 3ish months. I was having a weak moment where I was thinking about him and wanted to reach out because I genuinely missed the friendly banter - we had a lot in common and the same sense of humour. I figured there was no harm in checking in just to see how he was doing.\n\nBefore reaching out, I thought I'd try to find him on social media because that might just satiate my urge to see if he's well and then I wouldnt need to renege on my goodbye.\n\nI found out he is married and had lied multiple times to hide that fact.\n\nIt stung a little - not because I ever wanted more but because I was lied to and I feel like it ruined possibly a great friendship - if he had disclosed his marital status at the beginning I firmly believe I would have been stronger in shutting down anything questionable rather than letting small things slide because he was single.\n\nWhich brings me to my dilemma. I'm now super morally conflicted. Do I let his wife know?\n\nI panicked and decided to message him last night. He didn't seem interested in picking up where we left off (which was a relief!) so then I told him what I learnt and asked why he lied.\n\nWe spoke over the phone and he's basically begging me not to tell her because he believes it will end his marriage.\n\nI'm trying to think if I was the wife, would I want to know?\n\nIt never got as far as an actual relationship or sexting etc or anything but the fact that he lied about being married when he really didn't have to, and also that he's panicking about his wife finding out is making me worry.\n\nI said surely if you told her we met as friends and things got a bit carried away so we mutually cut contact she'd be able to work through it but he was adamant she wouldn't which makes me think this might not be his first incident.\n\nI told him that I will be reaching out to her, but will give him some grace, and granted him some time to tell her first. He will let me know in a few days when he's going to have the conversation with her.\n\nAm I doing the right thing forcing him to confess to her or was it harmless enough that I could just leave it alone?\n\nI'm trying to do right by the wife but never been in a situation like this before.\n\nAny advice appreciated.\n\nTL;DR Dude I met online lied about being married and definitely crossed some lines. Do I tell the wife?\n\nEDIT: to fix context where I could see people misunderstanding, and also to add: 1) I did inform my husband (see my comment replies) and 2) I'm not out for revenge - I can happily let this go and want to! but just wondering if it's the right thing to not inform the wife",

I had an old friend reach out to me. I knew him before I was married and he would flirt constantly when I was single. When he reached out, I explained I had gotten married since we last talked and I can only offer friendship from here on out. Mind you, I never entertained his flirting because I didn't want to ever do anything with him. He was just a friend to me. He said he understood and we talked as friends for about a month, my husband knew about the past (read most of the conversation) and told me that I can be friends with him and that he trusted me. About a month of us talking he started throwing in little flirts here and there. Telling me I'm pretty. I would remind him that I was married and I can only offer friendship and if he didn't stop flirting he would lose access to me. He was a good friend to me before I got married and he was a good friend to me after I got married and I didn't want to lose a friendship because he had crossed the line that I place firmly. The next day he flirted again and I told him \"I have asked you several times to stop flirting with me. I am married and have no intention of being with anyone aside from my husband. I am telling you this so you don't wonder why I blocked you. You need to learn to respect boundaries when they are placed.\" and I blocked him. I told my husband and showed him the messages. He's glad that I stood up to my beliefs and sad for me that I had to lose a friend who helped me through a lot mentally in the past. He also told me that he wanted to warn me about guys but figured I would do the right thing. \n\nI personally think you are kind of TA for the mere fact that you are mainly mad at him for lying about his martial status. I believe you can be friends with the opposite gender but you have to keep them at arms length and if they are married I would suggest becoming friends with the spouse as well.",

You again broke the sanctity of your marriage. \n\nLastly, even after what you believe as \"you did the right thing\" by ending that \"friendship\" you missed the idea of another man who isn't your husband and went back to him to seek some sort of gratification or satisfaction. \n\nOwn up to your actions; because you were equally the villain in your story as much as he was. You're no better than him by allowing a foreigner into your marriage, whether known or not, getting played, and wanting revenge by contemplating if you should contact his spouse. \n\nYou got played, are in denial, and your pride/ ego is hurt. \n\nNo judgement here, just be accountable and be a better person. If you still want to contact his spouse then show your husband this thread as well. Your husband probably deserves better but IDK who and how he is.",

        "text": "Some short backstory just for context bc I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll respond to many comments. Likely will just read them. I\u2019m a 51 yr old woman. My husband is 49. We have 3 kids, 27 yr old son, a 19yr old daughter, and a 17yr old son. Me and my husband have been married for 28 years at this point. From what I know, but he has been completely faithful up until around half a year ago. I have never cheated. I should add, I am a lurker. Not a bot. I have seen people getting accused of being a bot and I don\u2019t want that right now.\n\nAnyways, I am really fucking conflicted. I\u2019m sorry. I recently found out my husband was cheating on me with our neighbor\u2019s son, who is a 19yr old male. We have known this kid since he was born. It\u2019s genuinely so heartbreaking, because we basically helped raise this kid. He was my daughter\u2019s best friend, and he had sex with him.\n\nI found out he was cheating by the fact I walked in on them in our house when coming home from work bc I forgot my lunch and didn\u2019t want to order. I felt I should add this before anyone asked.\n\nHe admitted to me that it had been going on for about half a year bc apparently my weight gain due to menopause was making him not attracted to me anymore. He said he was \u2018trying\u2019 and was going to stop soon and tell me. He was begging me not to leave him though.\n\nBut the thing is? I feel more bothered by the fact he cheated with a man than that he cheated in general. I feel like it wouldn\u2019t be nearly as bad if it were a woman, or someone who was remotely like me. I\u2019m not sure though. It just makes me sick thinking about the fact that he was with a man. I\u2019m not homophobic at all, I want to mention. I am an ally and my youngest is gay. It\u2019s not that my husband might be gay or bisexual or whatever.\n\nYet, despite all of it, I want to stay with him. It feels weird, but the thought of leaving him feels worse than how it felt when I found out he was cheating. I don\u2019t want to leave him at all. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m dependent on him financially, and he\u2019s been super supportive and healthy and all outside of this all. I don\u2019t have any reason to stay, but I want to. I want to forgive him. Every time I look at him though, I keep thinking back to that moment.\n\nWhat do I do? I don\u2019t want to leave him, but if if I have to, I will. I hate how this feels. I don\u2019t know if this is right subreddit for this, sorry.\n\nTl;dr: my husband cheated on me with the neighbor\u2019s son/our daughter\u2019s best friend. I want to stay with him. Looking for advice.\n\nEdit: I just want to say thank you already. Probably will update more, but I\u2019m going to try and stay with my mother for a little bit. I\u2019ll talk to the neighbor later and see if he\u2019ll tell me anything about it. If I shouldn\u2019t, just let me know. I don\u2019t know much about grooming victims, but everyone is saying my husband is likely a pedo/groomer, so I\u2019m taking the advice on that all.",

A couple of things really stand out to me: the age of the boy, and the fact you\u2019ve always known him. That smacks of grooming, no matter if the lad seemed okay with it. He would because he\u2019s been conditioned for it to be the norm over goodness knows how many years. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be believing the 6 months rubbish; the second thing is your husband blaming *you* for his shitty cheating behaviour. Whether he lost attraction for you or not, that was on *him*. *Not you!* He could have spoken to you about what he was feeling, but he didn\u2019t. This supposedly \u2018completely faithful\u2019 man chose not only to cheat on you, but to fuck the male kid he\u2019s known since he was born. *In your house.* If that doesn\u2019t turn your stomach, I don\u2019t know what would. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t believe he\u2019s never cheated before, and with other men. \n\nIt\u2019s up to you what you decide to do, but don\u2019t stay gullible because you don\u2019t want your life to change. Actually, it\u2019s *him* who doesn\u2019t want *his* life to change, and I bet he\u2019s petrified his family, friends and neighbours\u2014including the parents of this boy\u2014find out exactly who he is. He\u2019ll tell you anything to make sure you stay. Is this what you want your life to be from now on? To not trust the man you\u2019re living with? To wonder, every time he goes out, whether he\u2019s being unfaithful? To wonder every time *you* go out whether your husband is fucking someone else in your bed? It\u2019s up to you. Personally, I\u2019d get a full STI check done\u2014and get him to do the same\u2014then I\u2019d speak to divorce lawyer to find out exactly what my next steps are. Better to rip off the bandaid and live with the pain now, than to bleed out slowly over however many years/tears it takes for you to realise this *is* who he is, and you should have believed him.\n\nI\u2019ve been with my (now) husband for 41 years (since I was 16). He\u2019s never given me cause to doubt his fidelity in all that time. If I found myself in your position, we would be over. I would never be able to believe that a man who supposedly loved and respected me could treat me like that, and I have too much respect for myself to continue in the delusion. **You are worth so much better than this.** Updateme!",

He is at least bisexual, possibly closeted. That can be hard to combat as an opposite sex partner. If the desire for sex with the same sex is there, it may not stop with one affair.\n\n2. He had an affair with someone the same age as his own child (possibly groomed). He says it had only been going on \\~6 months, but are you sure it didn't start sooner? Attraction to someone that young won't go away either.\n\n3. He blamed it on you. No...this is 100% a HIM problem. You gaining weight is not an excuse to have sex with a (very) young person of the same sex.\n\nAll those are big concerns.\n\nI get loving someone and feeling like you don't want to lose them, ( I can't begin to imagine my life without my husband) but, there are some issues that are too big to overcome. At the very least, I would suggest counseling. These are issues you can't just sweep under the rug, ignore and go on like it didn't happen. It will lead to living your life in fear it will happen again and resentment.

That is fully understandable especially at our age, but it doesn\u2019t make it acceptable to do nothing though. \n\nAnd while the neighbor may be a legal adult \u2018man\u2019, he also a teenage boy and one that your husband has known well since he was a baby. The chances that he went from completely neutral, appropriate behavior around the boy to full sexual relationship on or after his 18th birthday, are slim to none. There was UNDOUBTEDLY some predatory behavior & grooming along the way and it\u2019s damn creepy even if it is legal now. That should not be tolerated especially because it\u2019s highly unlikely to completely stop even now after the discovery.

Your husband is most certainly at the least bisexual, that in itself isn\u2019t an issue, but the betrayal, and the choice of his affair partner most certainly is. Can you get some individual counselling with an infidelity trauma expert? You need a safe space to work through your grief and pain.\n\nYou might try posting this in the sub Reddit r/straightspouses Don\u2019t let him manipulate you any more than he\u2019s done already.

But we have zero affection (he doesn\u2019t like it), different outlooks on how to spend time or future goals, and a non existent sex life. We don\u2019t even kiss. A lot of it is my fault because I know this is how he\u2019s been for the 13 years almost we\u2019ve been together and I overlooked a lot of it to maintain peace, but it has clearly taken a toll on me. We\u2019ve both made efforts to try to improve things so I don\u2019t want to discount the ways he\u2019s changed in the past couple years, but we are on different emotional wavelengths and I don\u2019t feel like I love him anymore. I\u2019ve lost that attraction and respect for him.

Sometimes I have to make my intent for romance so blatantly obvious I'll put out lingerie for her to put on (done this 3 or 4 times), sometimes she will, other times she will wait until I get out of the shower, and with her normal PJs on tell me she's too tired. It still just always seems like sex is a chore and it only ever happens when I initiate. \nI'm tired of it, I've talked to her about it numerous times and no change. I've stopped trying. We don't tell each other that we love each other, we've stopped kissing. \nWe're room-mates with kids together. I'm not even sure counseling would help. \nShe complains to me that I don't help with indoor chores enough, but whenever something is broken, I fix it, when decorations change for the season, I get all of the stuff out and set up the big stuff. I asked her to just give me a list of her expectations of me for house work, and she refuses to help me understand these duties she is expecting of me. \n(I do ALL of the outdoor maintenance, we live on an acre of land with a ton of grass, I keep the property well manicured, and keep our pool in good condition)\nI love her in the fact that she is a good mother, keeps the house stocked with food and essentials and cooks dinner a few days each week. But I think I've fallen out of love with her in every other way, romantically, emotionally, etc..\nShe had cancer 2 years ago, beat it and still takes chemo pills for preventative maintenance and is always using the pills as an excuse for being tired, but that doesn't stop her from going out with her friends once or twice every couple weeks and enjoying herself.",

Like to an extent, there were bad things about the relationship. Ultimately, we were incompatible on a lot of things, his sense of humor being the biggest one. I just didn't enjoy it AT ALL.\n\n I thought to myself one day about how shitty it would be to have to sit through his jokes about our daughter. And even now, it's already started. Something that he will tell anyone when they're mildly wrong \"you don't know what you're talking about.\" How do I know this? He did it to me. If I was slightly incorrect about something, he would tell me that while I didn't know what I was talking about, I was on the right track. He'd say it in this ridiculous Boston accent(we are from the midwest) so I was supposed to understand that it was a joke. \n\nBut a couple of months ago, I told my daughter to remind her dad that his charger cord doesn't work with her diabetes receiver. She told me \"but he will say I don't know what I'm talking about.\" She's six. And it breaks my heart. Because that means I'll have to work overtime to help build up her confidence in her ability to trust her brains knowledge. \n\nAgain, objectively he's not a bad person. But while I loved him, I didn't want to spend the rest of my life with someone that didn't fulfill all of my emotional needs or where I'd constantly be explaining \"that's just his humor.\" For some people it hits, but for my personal life it's not necessarily something I wanted anymore. \n\nWe have tried again. Multiple times. But each time I'm reminded of why I left in the first place. There were a lot of reasons but emotional immaturity and lack of emotional affection were big ones.",

My husband is a super nice guy, great father, etc but I feel I  am losing connection. I have my own issues, like being on antidepressants has tanked my libido but I recently started decreasing my dose to hopefully get it back. He has a medical condition that makes sex a little harder but it still can happen. He also has a tanking libido and we\u2019ve talked about all our issues but they never seem to get resolved. Our kids make us us very stressed and tired . He especially gets tired because of said medical condition. So I am wondering if I should just hold out til our kids are older and we have more time and energy to devote to our marriage. I feel like I definitely think about it more. I get upset that we are like roommates now. I feel like I\u2019m getting bored with him. I am not quite sure if I am in love anymore. It\u2019s been around 14 years together so I do love him but am I still IN love? I don\u2019t know. I feel like I am more willing to make effort because he gets distracted way easier and can\u2019t focus on more than one thing at a time while I am thinking about at least 20 things at once \ud83d\ude05   So I have no advice just a listening ear as someone in the same boat \ud83e\ude77",

I\u2019d say we have a good marriage but like anybody we\u2019ve had our rough spots and been through hard times. Recently my wife was diagnosed with an auto immune disorder that\u2019s caused the most stress as it causes her daily pain, fatigue, etc. Plus I believe she is perimenopausal. In the last 3-4 years we\u2019ve probably had sex maybe 5-6 times. There\u2019s been a couple more instances of other pleasurings but that\u2019s it. She is just not interested any more. We have talked about and she has just flat out told me that. She just wants to get in bed and watch tv or shows on her iPad and not be bothered. Doesn\u2019t even want to cuddle, which is honestly what I\u2019d be happy with most nights. I don\u2019t know how to deal with this. \n\nThen today - and I know I\u2019m wrong for this - I was reading her texts to a friend where she was talking about some I had sent her about a separate issue and I was venting about it. Her response to her friend was that she was just going to have to be done with that situation, that she can\u2019t handle it anymore. There\u2019s nothing for her to handle except support me and listen.\n\nI honestly felt like we are roommates at this point, just wrangling kids, getting them where they need to be and surviving. No I didn\u2019t marry her for sex but physical touch and conversation is still important to me. I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nTl;dr My wife and I aren\u2019t having sex any more and I feel like we are just roommates. Help?",

The above, you being dependent on her isn't going to spark her interest. Other than that you say your relationship is mundane, I'm assuming that describes your life as an individual as well? Your wife at least has a friend she communicates with (and leans on for support), do you at least have that?\n\nYour wife isn't interested in you, but I am asking what is there about you she hasn't already learned and what sides of you has she not yet seen?

I\u2019ve been a stay at home Mom to care for our toddler who is severely autistic. Recently I got on IHSS and SSI for her and I\u2019ve been getting paid more than him, with this help. When I got the back pay I paid off both of our debts and I put the rest in my savings. We\u2019ve been talking about getting a house, so I\u2019ve been saving for that reason. He\u2019s since accumulated more debt and he just found out I have quite a bit saved up and he got really upset about it. He says that not only should I give him half of my check, since he helps out with our daughter but I should pay off his debt since I have the money. We had an argument about this because I don\u2019t want to touch what\u2019s in my savings. Since I\u2019ve been getting paid, I help with the rent, bills, groceries and whatever is needed, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m keeping it for myself. I had already paid off his credit card and he wants me to keep paying for it without him having to ask. Am I wrong for not wanting to? Should I stop putting money away and give it to him instead?\n\nTl;dr: my husband wants me to give him half of my IHSS check and pay off his credit card because I make more than him. ",

But 10yrs of marriage and we don't fight about money.\n\nAll that being said, the answer is NO. If he is going to be irresponsible with money, then he can not be trusted to handle the money. If he's going into debt over stuff you don't need, then he needs to stop it. If he's putting groceries and gas on the credit card, then you need to rework your budget. Regardless, he can't demand you pay him. He's not a coworker. He's your husband. You can & should discuss how the money is going to be used.

                "body": "No. Unless his debt was to pay for you guys to live, no.\n\nFirst, the money is for your child. If you get a house, she\u2019ll have an asset that would afford you the ability to take care of your kid.\n\nNOTE: FHA loans allow you to buy with 3.5% to 5% downpayment. So if you live in a low cost area or move to one, your savings really can make this happen. FHA loan officer with even work with you and count roommate rent as INCOME helping you to qualify for the loan.\n\nHow does a house do help your kid?\n1) gives you the ability to rent a room on exchange for help with your kid. That gives you the ability to go back to work or at the least, take a weekend to yourselves where you get a small break. Renting a room can also just add to your finances. You save it to help pay for the house/maintance/utilities, etc.\n\n2) if your child grows up to be mostly capable of things but still in need of a caretaker to help her, then\u00a0\nA) she\u2019ll have as asset that can help her get a mate that doesn\u2019t mind her not working or having difficulties with doing things other things. No rental bill in exchange for help in from the mate paying for utilities, food, car doesn\u2019t seem so uneven.\n\n\ud83d\udc4b NOTE: talk to someone about putting the house in your child\u2019s name or a trust for your child. That means if you get sick and need long term care from Medicaid, get divorced, or you child marries and gets divorced, the house is protected and remains \ud83d\udcaf the property of your child. You can be in clauses when the trust can be broken. Like if you child needs long term nursing home care, the trust can be broken to help pay for that care. Or the house can stay on the trust and the rent helps with the care- so talk to a financial manager/lawyer that deals with the disabled and trusts.\n\nB) if she\u2019s not equipped to handle having a mate, the house still allows her to rent rooms. Depending on how many rooms are usable brs (you can wall up a family room and that can work as a br to rent) your child would be able to at the least offer lower rent in exchange for help to having 1-2 extra rooms that can also be lower rent for help or just be income that can help with her medical needs and living costs..\n\nC) if at some point she needs to live in a nursing home, the house can be sold and help her pay for either a nicer home the Medicaid would pay for or to supplement her needs or buy things Medicaid doesn\u2019t cover.\n\nIf you pay for your husband debt, he\u2019ll just run it up a 3rd time. That\u2019s why he wants half. So he can use the money for whatever stupid things he wants to buy to up his lifestyle. Plus he still wants you to pay his credit card whenever, so that means he plans to BOTH use his half of the money on himself and YOUR half of the money for himself thru credit debt!\n\n\ud83d\udea9 you may not be able to stay together if he if he doesn\u2019t start thing of the child\u2019s long term needs!\n\nAlso, helping with his OWN child, does not make him a full time caregiver like you are. You are getting paid for the job you are doing and to help with the expenses your child needs as they grow to give them the best chance of being independent when you\u2019re gone.\n\nThis money should not be used to up your life style.\n\nYour husband is being really selfish and also is not thinking of the long term needs of your daughter.\n\nSpeak to a financial manager, a trust lawyer, disability rights group, and research what your child realistic needs in the future.\n\nRemember, you are responsible for HALF your husband\u2019s debt (divorce) to 100% if he dies- whether you know about the debt or not. Your husband may have more credit cards and debt that you don\u2019t even know about. You need to ask him to show you credit reports from all 3 credit reporting agencies as his debt or credit score can make it hard for you to buy a house.\n\nThat\u2019s why you need to speak to a divorce lawyer. I\u2019m not saying your husband is bad and you should divorce. But my dad crippled my mom with debt. He stole from my college fund and later my disability benefits.\n\nSo you must think of your child first. You just paid down his credit cards. Since he ran them up again and wants your pay, you may be able to legally separate and NOT owe any of his his debt or to at least put a STOP to peeing any more debt he runs up after the legal separation.\n\nNOTE: if you do wind up paying for the house yourself, look for a 3br with extra living space (finished basement/attack) and rooms that can work as BRs (so probably avoid open space houses)- you\u2019ll have plenty of room for roommates. 3br is usually lower property taxes than 4 br. Having a bathroom 3/4 bathroom in the first floor is also helpful.\n\nOnce you get to 20% equity, refinance with conventional loan and you\u2019ll lose the mortgage insurance you pay with a lower downpayment.\n\nGood luck.",

He doesn\u2019t get monetary bonuses for caring for his own child as though  he\u2019s not a part of the child . That says he is  not connected and looks at himself as a babysitter? There is something strange about that. Could he have  underlying animosity because the child is autistic? \n\nNext I\u2019d ask why he got into more debt. Did he work less ? Was it household debt? Or personal desire debt for himself. Big difference in the reason for debt. You feel pressured with his pushing but take a breath you don\u2019t owe him instant gratification. Go over the reason he got in debt and wants you to bail him out for the 2nd time! . \n\nYou have to protect your child with money earmarked for her.  She\u2019s your responsibly in his mind and he doesn\u2019t  want that responsibility and might just think of himself as a babysitter looking for compensation. You need to check out his motive for putting monetary terms along with spending time helping with his child? I can only see this without emotional filter, you might need to figure that out. Face the possible truth and put your emotions aside for a bit. \n\nBack him off with, \u201cI need to think about this \u201c then find out why he\u2019s getting in debt. Selfish? Self indulgent? Entitled? Dumb about the value of money? I\u2019m not judging I\u2019m trying to look at the analytics that you need to assess first. Once it\u2019s gone it gone and money comes very slowly in hand with a lot of effort. Does he drink? gamble? Lottery? Where does his money go responsibly? Where does It  go foolishly? You have a lot to think about,  but he took no lesson from being debt free. Don\u2019t be pressured ! \n\nYou are the responsible one, so think of yourself and your daughter first , because he cannot do that. I strongly urge you to invest your money in short term  treasury bonds, or high-yield CDs at the bank. They earn interest . Continue saving in a savings account and buy another Bond or CD when your savings rises to $1000 this I\u2019ll help you get a nice down payment for a house. You don\u2019t need permission from hubby to do by those from the bank . Then they are untouchable until you need them . \n\nHe has to get out of debt   He has a family. he\u2019s not riding alone, you are there. Every decision is for the good of the partnership .

        "post-author": "Otherwise-Song-9533",
        "text": "\nI(22F) have been married to my husband(23M) for about 40 days. While we have only dated for almost two years and were friends for a couple of months prior to dating- he\u2019s still on this defensive strike. \n\nWhile I understand this is due to his upbringing, I am self aware of the effects of a parent that scolds you and doesn\u2019t let you share your thoughts/feelings. I know no one likes to be told when they are wrong. But I feel like his trauma has manifested into an ego where he can never be wrong. \n\nHe reacts to advice and guidance as an attack most of the time. This is off putting as his wife. We made a promise to one another to do better and shared our dreams to grow and become better version of ourselves. I am often met with attitude, dismissed, or the occasional \u201cyou\u2019re not my mother\u201d response. \n\nThis brings so much frustration into our relationship and makes it hard to get anywhere. Even though he has time to time made a genuine sounding apology, it comes back full circle. Communication and understanding is important in any relationship. But sometimes it\u2019s hard for me to believe him when he\u2019s once said \u201cI will not apologize if I feel like I didn\u2019t do anything wrong\u201d. There been times I prompted him to apologize when he was wrong and he flips the script and blames me for how I feel. Either I\u2019m \u201coverreacting\u201d or \u201cyou sound illiterate\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s grammatically incorrect\u201d. \n\nWe specifically had a conversation about this and he apologized. He said he didn\u2019t want our weekend to be bad. But today I mentioned I wanted to create a routine for him and he said \u201cyou\u2019re not my mother\u201d and I snapped back \u201cno I\u2019m not, I\u2019m your WIFE\u201d. All I want to do is work together to reach our goals. Isn\u2019t that what marriage is about? \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to workout to get stronger and be leaner. I struggle to do so but I\u2019ll workout once or twice a week. I\u2019m usually drained from work but I ask him for support. In the past before we got married he\u2019s told me to \u201cjust do it\u201d that it\u2019s what I want to do and that he\u2019s supportive of this goal. He\u2019s always said he wants to be fit like he was in college and the past few weeks he keeps saying he needs to get into a routine of stretching and working out. So I wanted to take the weight off of him and help create a routine for him. But we couldn\u2019t get to that point of the conversation before he got defensive. \n\nIt\u2019s become so draining and frustrating. I have more patience than most people I think. I\u2019ve even changed how I speak to him, I try to be polite and sincere. I feel like it\u2019s not fair that I adjust how I speak and he flys free with his words. That goes for me or most strangers. I just want him to grow for his own well being. The more he reacts to me this way the more I find myself snapping. While it\u2019s rare and I am very well at keeping my composure I found myself cursing him out in public. I haven\u2019t done something like that since the very beginning of our relationship. We\u2019ve had our disagreements in public but this time I really didn\u2019t care how crazy I sounded. \n\nHe\u2019s always blaming everybody else for how I react towards his actions. \u201cYour always mad the closer we get to work because you hate our job\u201d when I call him out on something that hurts, or rubbed me the wrong way he uses this to deflect his part in my feelings just because we\u2019re at work, going to work, etc. \n\ntl;dr\nHe calls me his best friend and his wife for Christ sake! I don\u2019t understand the disconnect or the disrespect then. Many consider a wife to be a companion, friend, and teammate who supports their husband's goals and well-being. That\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to accomplish here. Marriage is for better or for worst, I know this. That\u2019s why I married him even after discovering his flaws. I know we\u2019re gonna forever be changing as we get older. I don\u2019t wanna be stagnant and I wanna change for the better! He says a lot but still chooses to stay up late to get time on two to three different games everyday of the week after work. He only stretches when his body is hurting. He doesn\u2019t take care of himself and I\u2019m finding hard to take care of myself. What can I do? How can I approach him and be more supportive? \n\n",

        "post-author": "EveryMind",
        "text": "I'm a total mess right now. Our 30 yr anniversary is only weeks away and I found out that my wife (50) had secret meetings with another man for a few weeks last month, ie during April. Without going into detail I do believe her that there was nothing physical, secret walks and meetings is all.\n\nI'm 58 and love my wife to pieces, she is everything to me and I cannot see any life without her. But in the raw days following me finding out, she has said somethings that have destroyed me, like she has been unhappy for months, she has fallen out of love with me. This is so hard to hear. The deceit and deception is killing me but I forgive her because the reality is I cannot live without her.\n\nShe never said anything was wrong up to then, and gave no signals. I have thought hard and even looked back at our text messages and photos to see if there was any hint. But it is the opposite, our last few months have been normal, she has been sending me usual nice messages, we've been going out a lot as usual, no hint anything was wrong - but then to say those devasting things?\n\nThe last 7 days she has been away on a planned girly holiday with relatives, these 7 days have been hell. I basically had hellish long days on my own just thinking about her constantly and praying for night time so I can try and sleep only to wake up 5 or 6 hours later still trying to figure this out.\n\nShe comes back tomorrow and I am so fearful. She has been very cold, hardly any communication. I am fearful she comes back tomorrow and states it is over and she is moving out. I could not bear that.\n\nI am also fearful I will not be able to take my own advice and stay calm, give things time and not make any rash decisions because I have so many questions I am very desperate to ask to try and understand what has happened. I just know that I am going to dive into all the Qs I have and not give her any time to even unpack - but that would be a mistake.\n\nSo long as she is still at home I need to remain calm and give it time but I don't think I have it in me. I need to understand how we can fix this as the alternative is not worth thinking about. I love her so much. But she is a totally different person in the last few weeks, so cold towards me, and this is a person who brightens every room she walks into usually. We are known as a lot of peoples \"favourite couple\" everywhere we go. And now this.\n\nThe devastation is incredible. Worst time of my entire life. The thought of this ending is destroying me and I can't imagine any future living apart from her. I would constantly be thinking about her, it would be relentless. I'm a freaking mess.\n\ntl;dr my wife of 30 years saw another man over a 5 week period and now says she doesn't love me and hasn't been happy for months.",

I'm sorry man, sometimes this sh*t just happens even though you did absolutely nothing to deserve it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nYou need individual therapy very badly, you sound borderline suicidal. Your wife is doing a very stupid and selfish thing, but you need to start being a little selfish yourself, you can't fix a relationship that your partner doesn't want to fix. Whether or not she comes to her senses, you will get through this. Sending you, I dunno, a bro hug or something.",

                                                "body": "OP first, I am very sorry.  I know you don\u2019t think you can live without her but you can and part of the image you need to present to her is that you absolutely can and will if she doesn\u2019t do her part.  Second, one of the best ways to handle many of your emotions is to get organized.  Sit down and type or write out your list of questions.  Print them.  Similarly, sit down and make a list of all of your assets and debts. Get copies of bank statements.  You have to prepare for the worst and the first thing an attorney will ask for is that.  You want to see her messages to him so ask for her phone and don\u2019t take no for an answer.\n\nNow the hard part:  you need to assume she had sex with this man.  Cheaters lie and trickle truth what happened by giving you enough to know they cheated but not everything so you will be more likely to forgive them.  Think about it objectively, if your an adult who is going to put a 30 year marriage at risk, would you stop at just walks? So you need to decide if forgiveness is possible if she did in fact have sex with him.  The worst, and I mean the absolute worst, thing you can do is let her know you will do anything and forgive anything if she will just stay.  She will see you as incredibly weak and treat you accordingly.  She needs to see you as firm, resolved and angry.  \n\nThere are some hard facts you need to share with her to break the affair fog she is in.  First, you tell her that regardless of whether you\u2019re able to work this out or not you will be telling everybody what she has done\u2026family, friends, church family and your kids.  She made some horrible choices and the actions that resulted will be known and seen by everybody. If she wants to do them she will be seen for them and that wouldn\u2019t be negotiable.  Second, you need to find out who this guy is, how and where they met/meet and if he is married you call his wife asap.  If you can do that before she even comes home from this trip, do it.  If you don\u2019t have his name, access your family cell phone plan online and look at her call and message logs and get his phone number.  Then online and get his name from a reverse phone search and go from there.  It\u2019s critical that you know who he is and if he is married get his spouse mobilized.  Third, have your plan together about what she has to do to re-earn you.  This is her problem and she has to own 95% of the work to re-earn you.  This isn\u2019t you doing the work and her sitting there deciding.  She has one decision: stay and work hard or divorce.  If she chooses divorce, don\u2019t leave.  Let her know if anyone leaves it will be her (she screwed up so the life disruption will be hers).   It may well be she has been unhappy but it started with him showing up. He has convinced her that she deserves more because he wants in her pants.  99% chance he doesn\u2019t want a long term relationship with her but he has her convinced he is the answer to all her problems.  !updateme",

I saw them on her phone, which was the \"what have you done\" moment. She deleted them immediately. The next day I found the guy and warned him off. He sent me an apology and said we would never see him again.\n\nThe bad thing was my knee jerk raw reaction.  I did the worst thing possible and turned into a please don't leave me arsehole. A few days ago we had a proper 1am bust up about it though and it was pretty awful. I shouted at her several times to get out and called her for what she was. We ended up back in bed though.\n\nWe have told our two grown up kids. I wish I hadn't now. But as far as I know that's as far as it has gone. Because of our jobs and social life, it would be  really big locally if this got out. Neither of us could deal with that to be honest.\n\nI'm going to have a big chat with her on Monday and it won't be the dweeb version of me, it will be my more normal persona - authoritative and in command.  I'll be drilling down into exactly what happened so I can decide what I want to do - although I know inside that there is only one outcome I am seeking, resolution. I don't think she really feels guilty, she is justifying it by sticking to this \"not been happy\" nonsense. Pretty sure she will feel guilty after I drill all the details out.",

Long-term marriages have their own universe of trust and reciprocity, and these bonds have been broken,.\n\nBe prepared for the worst, basically your wife has a boyfriend.  And she didn't confess to you--her cheating was discovered by you. If you read enough similar posts to yours, it's almost textbook that your wife is lying to you about how deep her connection is with this man, especially if you confronted her on the phone and not in person.\n\nYour pain is horrible and justified. One way to process this nightmare is to begin taking action. Right now you are in pure reaction mode to your wife's cheating. She's driving the bus.  Please reclaim your dignity and self-respect by seeing a divorce lawyer, because it would be prudent to be educated about all your options. She may do this immediately  if she feels that either your marriage is done, or she's madly in love.\n\nYou should also talk with your closest friends. Social shame shouldn't apply to your situation. The more people know the more you can live with the truth and have support. Most likely your wife will spin some phony narrative that aims to rationalize her bad behavior and you won't come off well at all. \n\nI'm sure that thinking of your wife in such negative ways seems unnatural and wrong. But the truth is that she blew up your marriage for purely selfish reasons. Don't accept blame here for her transgressions.\n\nAlso check out the ChumpLady website.\n\nSince your mental health therapy isn't helping, just posting your thoughts and fears here may be among the most therapeutic thing you can do.

This just dropped on you and to her she made multiple decisions to cheat months ago.  So to her this isn't new at all.  \n\nSo now YOU are in reaction mode.   You have to do all this with all the pain and suffering you are going through but my man you can do this!   You are going to divorce her so you need to do that and try and keep a calm head about you.  \n\nSteps I would do.  \n\nTalk to a lawyer as soon as possible.  Do what he says, even if it contradicts what I say here.\n\nBe calm but get the message out to your friends and family as soon as possible.  Be calm!  Tell them the truth.  Tell everyone.   If you are on social media make those changes today and again state the facts and try and take emotion out of it.   Tell people you would appreciate their support during these difficult times.\n\nNext is to separate finances as much as possible.  I am like you and have been married almost 30 years. I realize how near impossible that would be BUT you need to get her off your life insurance, etc as soon as possible.   \n\nNext, for your own mental health you need to get a plan together for yourself.  Your life is not over, and you have a new chapter coming in your life.  My man you get to define that chapter.   Things I would consider.  Joining a gym and working out every day for a few hours.  This has proven to be more beneficial than therapy.   Eat well and think of some new hobbies.  You will want to plan out your week and eliminate dead time as much as possible.  If you can set some goals and work towards those goal, then you should feel better.\n\nAgain my man, this is new to you.  You are getting screwed here and I am sorry for that.  It is NOT new to her. \n\nGood luck, and I know you will get through this and you can become a better man and have a great life now.  She is basically dead to you.   Treat her that way and move on.",

                "body": "So after reading your post, and not reading any comments.. I'm going to tell you this.. And don't take it personally, I'm not attacking you or anything, just giving you my honest opinion. What SHE did is horrible, you don't deserve to be treated that way from someone who supposedly loves you. I went through something similar not too long ago, my wife told me out of nowhere that she didn't feel the same, that she loved me but wasn't in love with me, or at least didn't think she was.. It hit me like a ton of bricks. Everything leading up to that day was normal, I did the same thing and looked back on everything trying to figure out where I went wrong. I know a few weeks before that I noticed a change and I would ask her what was wrong, if I did anything, if I could do anything for her but always got the same response from her saying she was fine and nothing was the matter and how she was \"tired\" usually. This lasted a month. The first 2 weeks was horrible for me as I honestly didn't know what to do considering I loved her so much and missed my best friend. I missed sleeping next to her. The day she told me I moved to the guest room. She wanted space, wanted to figure herself out... Whatever the fuck that means.. I was left feeling empty, kinda like I assume you are right now.. I gave myself a month or so for this to figure itself out. I tried to do my own things, leave her alone and give her space, I started working out, thinking about how I'd continue living without her if that's what she ended up deciding. I got myself in a better headspace. If my wife would have been seeing a man though, I would have just called it quits to be honest. That's cheating, regardless if they had physical connection or not. She lied to you and kept this a secret from you. She technically replaced you with another man. I get you love her so much and don't see a life without her but man.. Don't take this bs from her. Do t let her treat you like this and get awa5with it and make it seem like it's your fault. You both are a team. So you both share the blame, honestly tho she deserves more of the blame considering she did what she did. I don't see myself continuing to be with a cheater but everyone is different. You may be able to since you don't see it as that bad since they had no \"physical connection\" you say.. I hate when women don't talk shit out. I hate when they have an issue and instead of talking about it and trying to fix it with their partner they instead hide it, act like everything is OK and then blow up letting all of this out just to crush you out of nowhere. I'd advise you to think about what it is you actually want to do.. Do you re9want to continue being with a person who could do this to you, and so easily? It obviously gonna be up to you in the end but have some self respect man. What she did was horrible, evil even.. What's the point in a marriage if you can't talk to your partner about things that are bothering you? I'd advise you to not rush things, buy a journal and write your thoughts and feelings down. Be mindful of it all. Don't lie to yourself. Approach her after you have had time to not obsess over her being with you. Think about a life without her and try to go do something on your own so you can see what it would be like without her for a bit. I. Sorry this happened to you, but know that you didn't deserve this, especially from the person you married, the person who's supposed to have you're back. Take it slow. Think, and think clearly about things before deciding anything. You're life won't end if she's not there, life keeps going no matter what. And when you do approach her, be honest about how you feel and how her actions hurt you. Good luck man, I hope you end up happy again",

A couple of days ago just out of the blue I get the \"I'm not happy and I've been thinking about a divorce.\" My first thought was \"at 72?!\" but I held my tongue. My wife has a lot of anger issues and constant health problems. Her family does nothing for her. I'm the one that's been there for her through everything and now this. Sadly I'm at the point that I don't even want to stop her. Even though I'm her husband and caregiver, which is a full time job, apparently nothing I do is ever good enough. All of the anger and resentment from her medical problems and family problems are always directed towards me. It has wore me down. I don't want a divorce. But I'm at the point in my life where being alone and not having to worry about living up to someone else's standards sounds like a dream. The only advice I would share is once the spouse uses the \"d\" word, or cheats on you, your marriage is pretty much over. Start taking measures to protect and prepare yourself. It's nothing you've done or not done. Husbands/wives get board and they just discard their spouse like an old shoe. They move on to the new hot and exciting person as if you never existed. Meanwhile your left with a broken heart, a broken bank account, and living on the street. Wish you luck.",

What you need to do is stay calm have some  self respect and don\u2019t cry or beg her to stay . That what she expects. Just listen to what she has  to say and tell her ok I need to digest all this . Talk to friend or therapist then plan your next course of action. Sometimes being calm, makes us woman wonder if we are making the right decision, throwing a fit and yelling and screaming will push her away and make her feel her decision was justified. Good luck",

She\u2019s anticipating that and so she\u2019s putting up her defences - acting cold and remote. \n\nIt\u2019s very possible WW is in a mid-life crisis and this affair has no depth. If OP acts completely whipped it only allows WW to put off having to face reality. And reality is one of two things, either this affair is strong enough that she leaves, or it\u2019s an illusion which pops when faced with the consequences. If it\u2019s the first, then pleading will only debase OP. If it\u2019s the second, then he needs to take control.\n\nThere is some good advice here - find out who the AP is, are they married. Get evidence - texts, phone records. Start compiling details on assets (check has she been spending money on AP or the affair). Get ready to cancel joint cards and move your share of monies. Definitely talk to a lawyer to understand the process and impact of divorce.\n\nIf OP has time, get a Voice Activated Recorder (VAR) and when talking with her ask why she did it - \u201cDid I ever abuse you? Did I ever cheat?\u201d Keep a recording of as many conversations as you can. It\u2019s very possible things could get nasty - too many stories on Reddit to ignore. Consider putting a VAR in her car. Secret recording in your property or car is at best a gray area legally, but it\u2019s evidence OP is gathering to inform how he proceeds. He doesn\u2019t have to reveal how he got it.\n\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely they only held hands. He should assume it was a full-blown affair and act accordingly. Divorce takes a long time - plenty of options to put it on hold if WW (and OP) truly want reconciliation. By initiating it now, OP is showing he\u2019s not going to be a pushover.\n\nI think you should inform AP\u2019s spouse- if there is one. They could become a very strong ally. Inform both families, and close friends. If she accuses OP of trying to ruin her - he should let her know who started the ruining, and if the affair really is true-love then all this had to come out anyway.\n\nBut the most important thing is OP must take action.\n\nAlso OP, keep in contact with this forum. So many people on this road ahead of you say they got great support from here. \n\nTough times ahead. Square your shoulders OP and good luck.",

I\u2019ve been down this road, it\u2019s way to easy to convince yourself using their lies to minimize the shock but 99% of the time it\u2019s complete utter bullshit and lies, if you dig deeper, you will slowly and painfully find out more and more and if she has a shred of conscience she\u2019ll slowly and painfully admit each additional layer of discovery and let the \u201cTruth\u201d slowly encompass MOST of what they did, but only if there is solid proof, anything else she will lie away til her dying breath. \n\nSave yourself possible years of torment and tell her to pack a bag and GTFO. It\u2019s not worth it to fight for a woman that will so readily and willingly betray the shit out of you and lie to your face on a daily basis. I know it sounds harsh but your happiness and healing will be exponentially faster with the Ho-removal procedure. \n\nNow. Conversely, IF she seems like she may actually be one of the few unicorns that is actually fully and truly remorseful and capable of meaningful change, reconciliation may be possible, but the vast fucking majority of the heavy-lifting of reconciling is on HER. Don\u2019t bend on this, don\u2019t torture yourself, she has to prove it to YOU. I don\u2019t give a shit what you did, she\u2019s a big girl and could have communicated with you or fucking ended it, and guess what she chose to go fuck someone else and be a lying ho, so she needs to figure out internally what allows her to think and act that way and fix it or you kick her ass to the curb and go live your fucking life happily away from someone who values you and your marriage so little.

He wanted to get in her pants. I don't buy that she's been unhappy for a long time BS. If she were that unhappy there would have been signs and unless you've been completely clueless you would have noticed a change in her behavior, in her demeanor before now. She's trying to convince herself that you're a bad partner so she can justify her betrayal. She knows what she's doing is wrong whether she wants to face it or not. \n\nShe's in the affair fog right now and not seeing this guy for who he is. She's romanticizing her connection to him. She's having those new relationship dopamine hits. It's going to be nearly impossible to reason with right now. Don't be surprised when this affair relationship falls apart when she sees him for who he truly is or when he rejects her after getting what he wants. \n\nDon't do the pick me dance, she will lose what little respect that she still has for you. Be firm and decisive. She needs to see consequences for her behavior and not telling others is not bring her consequences. \n\nDon't let her control the narrative. You can bet when this all becomes public (and it will come out especially if she leaves you) that she will try to paint you in the worst possible way in order to justify her actions to friends and family. Tell everyone exactly what she has done, she started an affair with another man and never communicated any unhappiness to you.

If you tolerate her disrespect believe me, she will lose even more respect for you and it will happen again. She\u2019s showing you with her words and her actions how little she cares. Believe her. She\u2019s acting cold, you need to show her what cold is. Record your conversations to protect yourself from any allegations. You think she\u2019d never do that? A lot of men have thought that and found out the hard way that they were wrong. The other guy is the man she plans to have replace you. You need to play hardball here and protect yourself. Go talk to the best lawyers you can find, several of them. That way she can\u2019t use them. Take half of your mutual money out of any accounts and put them into an account that she can\u2019t touch. And by all means, control the narrative. Tell your friends and family what she\u2019s done and that you will be divorcing her. If her AP is married, find a way to contact his wife and let her know what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you but, it\u2019s time to play hardball.",

Luckily I had come home early the day she left, otherwise I would have come home to a note. I was in shock and couldn't understand or think straight and said goodbye,  it didn't hit me until the next day. I had zero family nearby,  no friends, and was broke. I spent the next three weeks in a drunken stupor. Almost died from alcohol poisoning. I hadn't had any alcohol during our entire marriage.  I couldn't understand why she left, I hadn't been abusive,  I hadn't cheated, I worked hard to support her and our children,  allowing her to be a sahm.\n\nDon't do what I did. Reach out to others, find a support group. Stay away from alcohol or any drug. You have the right to have your questions answered with honesty.  30 years is a lifetime. I found happiness again, although that happiness is foreshadowed with the previous marriage its hard to let myself totally commit.

Is he married? You should consider exposing your wife to her family. Affairs thrive in the shadows, light is a disinfectant. Hiding her affair is complicity on your part.\n\nAnother normal thing is for her to suddenly make out like you are the worst husband ever or that the affair is your fault.

She\u2019s said the thing she\u2019s been feeling and knowing for a long time she\u2019s not in love with you anymore. In your eyes/mind you\u2019ve been a good husband. I think she\u2019s probably said something\u2019s over time but it didn\u2019t register with you that it was a big deal. A question you need to ask her is what was the last straw? I\u2019ve been married to my husband 29 years. I\u2019ve told him the things I\u2019m not happy about in our relationship. He promises to do better but two weeks later back to the same thing. Do I consider leaving Yes. I won\u2019t entertain another man. When I leave he\u2019ll swear he doesn\u2019t understand why. \nContinue to go to therapy. Ask her if she\u2019s willing to do marriage counseling but be prepared to hear all the things she feels about your marriage from her perspective. It\u2019s a real possibility that she\u2019s done she just hasn\u2019t move out. I\u2019m sorry.",
