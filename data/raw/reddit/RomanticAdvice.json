I have terrible social skills and i'm always afraid of talking to girls and say something weird or boring and be embarrassed. I'm really insecure about my apperence and body. My therepist say i have a beautiful face, but i'm a chubby guy and i know that a lot of woman don't like that. I always feel sad and lonely when i see happy couples doing cute things everywhere, including one of my friends who is in a really cute relationship. I just wanna experince this, been loved and feel love for someone, but it's so difficult ",

        "post-author": "FR33_NikolaiXOXOBSD",
        "text": "I need help!!\n\nI also need advice!! Does my crush like me? For context we met at an art club thing, he's a year older than me, we're young, he's autistic and has anxiety/ADHD and these r some things he does\n\n1. He\u2019s made long-term plans with me, not just stuff like \u201csee you tomorrow,\u201d but things that involve the future\u2014like things we might do together later, as if he\u2019s already imagining I\u2019ll still be in his life.\n\n\n2. He told me I\u2019m the person he\u2019s made the most eye contact with, which means a lot coming from him since he\u2019s autistic and making eye contact is usually hard. That tells me I make him feel comfortable and safe.\n\n\n3. He fidgets a lot around me, which might just be part of his ADHD/autism, but I noticed it\u2019s especially when we\u2019re close or when he\u2019s excited to talk to me, like he can\u2019t sit still because he\u2019s happy or nervous.\n\n\n4. He gives me really thoughtful gifts, not just random things. One time, I said I liked deer\u2014and later he gave me a deer plushie. That kind of remembering and personal effort shows he listens and cares deeply.\n\n\n5. He talks to me a lot, like way more than he talks to anyone else. Whether we\u2019re in person or texting, he keeps the conversation going and seems to want to keep me engaged.\n\n\n6. He trusts me with everything, even heavy stuff. He\u2019s opened up about his life, his feelings, and his mental health\u2014stuff he doesn\u2019t tell many people. It\u2019s like he sees me as his safe space.\n\n\n7. He\u2019s nice and loud around me, in a way that feels full of energy and joy. It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t feel like he has to mask around me. He shows his full self and even gets silly, which I love.\n\n\n8. He once told me about his struggles with his sister, things at home, and his mental health, and I was there for him through it. He made me feel like I made a difference, like I helped him feel supported.\n\n\n9. He said that one time when we played Roblox together, it actually helped him decide not to hurt himself. He told me later that my presence and friendship helped him that day\u2014even though I didn\u2019t know it at the time. That meant the world to me.\n\n\n10. During a game of Truth or Dare, he said he has no secrets he hasn\u2019t told me. That kind of trust is rare, and it felt like he was saying I already know the deepest parts of him.\n\n\n11. When I went on holiday, he texted me \u201cI miss you\u201d or \u201cI missed you\u201d multiple times. It was unprompted, sincere, and made me feel like he really noticed I was gone.\n\n\n12. Even when he\u2019s busy or offline, he replies to me when he checks WhatsApp at the end of the day. He doesn\u2019t forget, and he makes an effort to talk to me even if it\u2019s late.\n\n\n13. He always sits by me and talks to me at art group, like it\u2019s automatic\u2014he doesn\u2019t even look for another seat. He just finds me. It\u2019s like I\u2019m his default person.\n\n\n14. He mirrors my affection, like when I called him \u201cpookie\u201d and said I\u2019d pause my music for him (even though I love music), he replied saying he\u2019d pause his music for me too and called me \u201cpookie\u201d back.\n\n\n15. He said he\u2019d ship any characters I ship, even if he doesn't care about them, just because I care. That shows how loyal and supportive he is of my interests.\n\n\n16. We have inside jokes together, the kind that only make sense to us. It makes our bond feel unique and special, like our own little world.\n\n\n17. He uses silly, sweet, or even flirty emojis when texting me, like \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 or exaggerated reactions like \u201cLOL,\u201d and always keeps the tone fun and connected.\n\n\n18. He continues conversations even when he doesn\u2019t know what I meant, like when I said \u201cverbatim\u201d and he didn\u2019t know what it was\u2014he still replied and kept the tone light instead of stopping the convo.\n\n\n19. He consistently chooses me\u2014talking to me, sitting with me, texting me, trusting me\u2014again and again, even when he has other options. That constant effort feels like more than just a \u201cbestie.\u201d\n\n\n\nDoes he like me?? I need advice!! ",

He's neurodivergent which changes his view of social norms. \n\nHe probably isn't trying to indicate attraction, just initiate a geniune bond with you as someone he dearly trusts. Most neurodivergent affection is misjudged as 'flirting' and to me- as a suspected autistic person- sees these behaviours as fully platonic too.\n\nYour comment here makes me bat an eye though. He might like you back. Maybe he just really trusts you, obviously I can't tell through a screen.\n\nTry asking him about it, but don't make it a big thing. Such as asking for tone tags when he says something that you think is flirting. Be especially careful because he has anxiety and he could start to overthink on how you perceive him.\n\nI wish you well!",

        "text": "Looking for some advice and perspectives on a personal issue. During intimacy, my partner usually prefers to finish with oral and always chooses this option when asked. The only difficulty is with swallowing at the end-not because of the taste, but because the amount and thickness can make it feel like it gets stuck in the throat.\n\nShe says it\u2019s not a big problem and continues to choose this, but I want to be considerate and not push beyond comfort. My main questions:\n\nDoes this get easier or feel more normal with time and experience (1yr past)?\n\nOr is it something that might become uncomfortable or tiring in the long run?\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this, and how did you handle it?\n\nI want to keep things positive and comfortable for both of us, so I\u2019d really appreciate any advice or shared experiences from others who\u2019ve navigated this situation.",
