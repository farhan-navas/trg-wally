My response was to save for a ring and propose.\n\nTo my surprise, she refused...or to be precise, said \"Not yet\". She said she wants to \"make sure the plumbing works before buying the house.\" Apparently she is concerned at my age I may be suffering from reduced fertility. I should mention her prior marriage broke up because of his fertility issues. She wants to start trying for kids right away \"before you get any older\" and then we can get married if it works.\n\nI don't really like this plan. My Mom is very religious and it would create a strain in her relationship. My colleagues at work are divided between child free and married...I'd stick out.   I worry she's not into marriage at all and will refuse after the children are born. I've always felt that an unmarried man's legal rights to his child are precarious. And I think everyone will assume I refused to marry her and am the \"bad guy\". If I do marry her after having kids, it will seem like a \"shotgun wedding\".\n\nMy brother says I'm worrying to much, and I can have everything I want, just in the wrong order.  \nMy sister says she sounds \"weird\" and this is a red flag.\n\nShould I just go along with this and start trying for kids? Or should I stick to my guns?",

I keep comparing myself to his ex and girls he used to message. His mum also made a hurtful comment about my cultural fit for the family. I want to go back to feeling like my confident self again.\n\nMy boyfriend and I met on Hinge in Sept 2024 and became official in Jan 2025. At first, I felt secure \u2014 he was super affectionate and obsessed with me, and I enjoyed my space. Recently though, I\u2019ve become needy and scared he\u2019ll leave or stop loving me. He told me today he feels like he\u2019s walking on eggshells around me because I keep asking for reassurance.\n\nThe shift started when I went through his phone (I know, bad move) and saw he used to message lots of blonde, beachy bikini-type girls. Then I saw his ex on Depop \u2014 she\u2019s super thin and has an amazing body, and I spiralled comparing myself to her. I\u2019m an AU size 6, but he once said he likes that I\u2019m \u201cnot super skinny,\u201d which unintentionally made me feel worse. He also looked up a TikTok business/sales influencer on Instagram, Shelby Sapp, who looks like his type. He said he only searched her up for her sales content, but I felt insecure again.\n\nA few weeks ago, his mum (while drunk) questioned whether I fit in with his family culturally. He completely stood up for me and she apologised sincerely, but it still shook my confidence.\n\nI hate how I\u2019ve been acting \u2014 I keep asking if he still loves me or if I\u2019m his type, and I miss the confident, secure version of me. How do I shift the dynamic back to that?",

I would recommend some therapy, listening to Meg Robbins podcasts or yt videos can help, also during this time is very vital your bf is aware of your insecurities and what caused them. This is not something that will go away fast so he must be patient and help you by being there for you during this time. Even tho it won\u2019t really help saying it, try to not compare yourself, there\u2019s a reason why he liked you and maybe he has a type but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t like/love you but if he keeps looking for girls online like Shelby then I would recommend you setting a boundary or leaving if it\u2019s not something that you feel good with rn.",

His father is a Baptist pastor, and my family is strict Baptists. This made them like him more. While I was growing up, I was taught that interaction between men and women (kissing, touching, or anything to do with sex), should wait until marriage, because it is a special sign of love and loyalty to one another. Now I am not very religious, and have never claimed salvation. But that lesion they taught me stuck. I don't care what you do, whether you do p\\*rn, or just sleep around. But personally I do believe that it is special. I am almost 18, and have not had my first kiss, and am still a virgin, unlike many teenagers these days. Now I did not except him to be a virgin at 21, but I was shocked to hear from my friend about his sex life. He has had many girlfriends, and has a high body count. Even going so far as to where he has had a threesome with two girls. He seems to be very active, and I am obviously not. My idea is that people who sleep around, or have slept around in the past, will turn out one of two ways 90% of the time. They will stay single and continue to sleep around, or they will cheat. We are not dating yet, and he has been extremely respectful of me and my feelings. He does make alot of p\\*rn jokes, which do make me uncomfortable due to the way I was raised and my lack of knowledge, but hell he is a guy, and I haven't voiced the fact it makes me uncomfortable. When we start dating, I will gladly give him all the love he wants. Either physical or emotional. But I will still be living with my strict parents when I turn 18. Therefore I will not get to see him alot anyways. I fear that since he seems to be such a sexually active guy, he will get bored of not having someone to \"play with\" on the daily. (Now If I was with him daily I would 100% fulfill that need don't get me wrong.) But do you guys this he sounds like the type of guy to cheat? I mean people CAN change, and just because I haven't slept around doesn't mean I should judge him for it. But I am just trying to keep myself safe. My situation is complicated. Should I ask him how this will play out, or should I just see what happens and hope for the best? Do you thing he is just waiting for me to turn 18, and he will jump on me like a fly to honey, and he is just trying to hit it? Or do you think me might actually be interested in me?\n\nConversation (copy and pasted since I can't screen shot on snapchat) that we had\n\nMe:  \nIm just asking cause im curious and we never see each other in person. And I just wanted to know\n\n* Are you actually interested in me like \\*cousins name\\* is telling me? Or are you just being nice because you see me as a kid with a crush?\n* I also am to scared to ask in person lmao\n\nhis response:\n\nWell this whole thing is a little bit difficult and I\u2019ll tell you why. First off I do think you are very beautiful and super nice. I would say I\u2019m interested in you but that is where things get complicated. Since you are under 18 legally I can\u2019t date you or do anything because I don\u2019t want to be charged for anything. Last thing I want to do is us hangout or something and your parents freak out and press charges on me which they will have every legal right to do so. So I\u2019m kinda stuck at where I\u2019m at until you turn 18.",

Like, giant red flags\u2026 think bigger than China.\n\nThe fact that the only thing stopping him is the law and not the fact that you're still figuring out your life and maturity? That\u2019s a huge problem. That\u2019s not love or respect, that\u2019s someone waiting on a loophole. Super creepy.\n\nAlso, rule number one\u2014never date someone from work. Ever. Unless you\u2019re married, just don\u2019t. It gets messy fast.\n\nAnd if a guy's out here makin\u2019 corn jokes (you know what I mean), braggin\u2019 about threesomes, and has a body count like a Netflix documentary\u2026 he\u2019s not the guy who\u2019s gonna treat your heart with care. That\u2019s a low emotional IQ dude who probably sees relationships like a game.\n\nI get it\u2014you\u2019re almost 18, you wanna explore, bad boys seem exciting, rebellious, all that. But they\u2019re the ones that\u2019ll leave you hurt, confused, and wondering why you weren\u2019t \u201cenough\u201d when really he was the problem the whole time.\n\nWhen you're 18, yeah\u2014you\u2019ll legally be able to make your own choices. And I\u2019m not your dad, so you\u2019re gonna do what you\u2019re gonna do. But if you were my little sis, I\u2019d tell you straight up: don\u2019t do it.\n\nPut your energy into stuff that builds you up. Cool hobbies, goals, side hustles\u2014things that make you feel proud of who you are. Real love comes when you already know your worth, not when you're still hoping someone else will see it for you.\n\nAnd hey\u2014being too prude? Nah, you don\u2019t need to judge yourself for having values. Having a high body count doesn\u2019t make someone better, either. It\u2019s about balance. Respect yourself, love yourself, and someone who's worth your time will feel lucky to be with you.\n\nPlease stay safe. You\u2019re worth way more than some guy waiting around for a birthday to \u201cmake a move.\u201d\n\nIf you ever need to talk, vent, or need more real advice\u2014I got you.",

I'm really shy and insecure. I'm terrible at talking to people and i'm too scared to trying it. I think i would feel more secure if someone start talking and then i would continue, but people normally avoid talking to me. I'm also really insecure about my body. I''m fat, not in a way that looks horrendous, but i'm a chubby guy and i know woman normally don't like that. My therapist try to confort me, sayong that i have a beautiful face, smile and that i'm polite and funny, but i don't know if that's enough to get love. No one has ever showed intrest in me, probably because i don'ttalk much, but also because i'm fat. I just hate feeling empty like this, i just wish i could immediately change myself.",

It\u2019s not personal, it\u2019s just how people are. So rule number one: if you want connection, you gotta take the first step sometimes. And yeah, it\u2019s hard. But you can get better at it.\n\nCheck out a book called \"Rejection Proof\"\u2014it\u2019ll shift how you think about putting yourself out there. Rejection ain't the enemy, it\u2019s part of the process.\n\nNext, hop on Meetup.com or find local hobby groups. Pick up something you enjoy, even if it\u2019s random. Why? 'Cause when you meet people through shared interests, there\u2019s no pressure\u2014it just flows better. And if you want a real relationship that lasts, friendship first is always the best move. No masks, no games. Just learning who someone really is and letting them learn you too.\n\nNow therapy\u2019s cool and all\u2014but as a man, there\u2019s more you gotta do.\n\nHit the gym (even light workouts help).\n\nEat better, slowly.\n\nImprove your mental, emotional, financial, physical, and maybe even spiritual game.\n\nSet some goals\u2014even if they\u2019re small.\n\n\nIf you get just 1% better every day, that\u2019s 365% better by this time next year. It won\u2019t feel fast, but the confidence and results will come.\n\nEverybody wants a quick fix. But self-love and self-respect, bro, that\u2019s where it all starts. You attract better people when you treat yourself better.\n\nThink of it like this:\nIf you had to take care of a little kid, but you were sick and refusing to take your medicine\u2026 what good would you be to that kid?\n\nTake your medicine.\nGet better.\nStay strong.\nStay solid.\n\nAnd when the right woman comes along\u2014the one who sees how much you\u2019ve grown, how much you respect yourself\u2014she\u2019ll feel safe being loved by you, because she\u2019ll know you\u2019re solid enough to love her back the right way.\n\nYou got this.

But you\u2019re here trying to reflect and do right by her, and that\u2019s already a huge sign of maturity.\n\nNow, if you're not sure how to talk to her after what happened, here\u2019s something you can use as a framework. Not a script\u2014not telling you what to say word-for-word\u2014but more like a structure to help you share how you feel without making her feel attacked or misunderstood. It gives her space to process, too.\n\nYou could say something like:\n\n\n---\n\n\"Hey, when you get a quiet moment, can you read this? No rush at all, I just wanted to be clear and calm about something that\u2019s been on my mind.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about the other night and how things played out. I just want to say again\u2014I'm really sorry if I made you uncomfortable or triggered anything from your past. That was never my intention.\n\nAt the same time, I just wanna be honest with you. In the moment, the way you were reacting\u2014touching my hair, holding me close\u2014it seemed like you were enjoying it. I wasn\u2019t trying to cross any line. I thought I was making you feel good and close to me. When you suddenly pulled back, I got confused. Not mad\u2014just unsure and honestly a little worried. I\u2019d never want you to feel unsafe with me.\n\nLater, when you said you missed who you used to be, that really stuck with me. I know you\u2019ve been through stuff before we met. And I\u2019m not gonna lie\u2014sometimes I feel like I\u2019m walking on eggshells, worried I\u2019ll mess up without meaning to. I care about you, and I want us to be able to talk and trust each other more, not just physically but emotionally too.\n\nThis message is just my way of starting that. No pressure to respond right away. Just read it when you\u2019re ready and take your time. I really wanna hear how you feel.\n\nAnd if you ever feel like therapy\u2014alone or together\u2014could help, I\u2019d support that 100%. I want this to be good for both of us. Even if you need space or time for yourself, I\u2019ll respect it. What matters most is that you\u2019re okay.\"\n\n\n---\n\n^ Something like that, in your own words. Doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, just honest. This isn\u2019t about fixing it all in one message\u2014it\u2019s about opening the door to better communication, and building trust brick by brick.\n\nAnd bro\u2014just keep leading with care, not ego. That\u2019s how real relationships grow. You\u2019re doing better than you think.\n\nIf you want help shaping your own version of that, feel free to ask. You got this. \ud83d\udcaa",

And now you\u2019re stuck in that weird in-between where he didn\u2019t say he doesn\u2019t like you, but he also didn\u2019t say he does. That\u2019s frustrating, I get it.\n\nNow, a few things might be going on here:\n\n1. He might like you too but isn\u2019t ready for anything romantic. That could be nerves, fear of messing up the friendship, or just not knowing how to handle all the emotions.\n\n\n2. He could be the kind of person who really values the friendship and doesn\u2019t want to hurt you, but he\u2019s also not sure how to say \u201cno\u201d without things changing. That happens a lot, especially if he\u2019s not super emotionally mature yet.\n\n\n3. Or honestly? He may just not see you that way\u2014and that sucks, yeah\u2014but it doesn't mean you're not lovable or worthy of something real.\n\n\n\nAnd look, I say this with love: just because someone seems perfect for you, or you\u2019ve had feelings for a long time, doesn\u2019t mean they owe you the same feelings back. Love\u2014real love\u2014is not about picking someone and expecting them to check all your boxes. It\u2019s about two people who choose each other equally, and build something from a place of mutual care and connection.\n\nIf he\u2019s telling you he\u2019s \u201cnot a dating person,\u201d you kinda gotta take that at face value. And I know it hurts, but try not to read too deep into what wasn\u2019t said. Sometimes silence is still an answer.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the friendship can\u2019t be amazing. If he\u2019s kind, supportive, and values you\u2014it\u2019s still worth having that connection. You can still care for him without putting pressure on it. And honestly, sometimes guys take a little longer to figure things out emotionally. You might just be ahead of him in maturity or self-awareness.\n\nSo for now? Keep showing up as a good friend. Keep being the awesome person you are. Focus on giving that love you wanna share\u2026 to yourself first. When you do that, you stop depending on other people to validate your worth\u2014and that\u2019s when the right kind of love finds you.\n\nAnd if it turns out he\u2019s just not the one? That\u2019s okay too. It doesn\u2019t make you less. It just means someone better suited for your kind of love is still on their way.\n\nYou\u2019re gonna be just fine. Promise.",

What matters now is how you bounce back.\n\nIf you're feelin' that moderate depression creeping in, the best way to fight it isn\u2019t just to sit with it\u2014it's to move through it. And I don\u2019t mean fake positivity. I mean discipline. That\u2019s how you show love to yourself, especially on the days you don\u2019t want to.\n\nThink about it like this\u2014you ever have days where you didn\u2019t wanna get up and go to work, but you still did it anyway? You did it for your boss, or your kid, or to keep the lights on. Now it\u2019s time to show up with that same energy\u2026 but for you. Show up for yourself, every day.\n\nStart building positive habits. Even if it\u2019s just a 10-minute walk, journaling a bit, or picking up a new hobby that challenges you in a good way. Every day you improve 1%\u2014that adds up. A year from now, you\u2019re 365% better, stronger, and probably surprised at how far you\u2019ve come.\n\nAlso\u2014get out and meet people. Real people. Not for romance right away, but for connection. Hit up Meetup or local events. Join a class or group that aligns with something you're curious about. Make friends. And who knows\u2014maybe someone amazing will naturally come into your life once you're already doing things that make you feel whole.\n\nIf what you want long-term is a real relationship, it\u2019s best to start from a place of friendship and trust anyway. Real connection takes time, but it starts with you. You got this. Keep showing up. One step at a time.\n\nAnd if you need more tips or just someone to bounce thoughts off of, I got you. You're not alone in this.",

        "text": "ignore me if you've already seen me on a different reddit, haha... i'm just really desperate for advice from anyone and everyone!\n\nhi, i'm fifteen, and i'm embarrassingly smitten with my best friend. i'm whipped, head-over-heels. like, seriously, he's so cute, i have so many little daydreams that i cannot act out because of hesitance, and i'm so confused. i'm DESPERATE FOR HELP!!\n\n(sorry it's so long, i'm a bit of an over-explainer, haha... \ud83d\ude13\ud83d\ude13)\n\nthe gist is we're in the same grade and in the same marching band. i met him in seventh grade\u2014despite having always went to school together\u2014when we were dismissed from band camp (eugh...) to get our lockers. he couldn't open his, and i offered to help and stuck around until he could get it open (cute, right? right????). the unfortunate part is, i've never dated a man. my past two relationships were girls, and neither ended greatly, but we're on at least decent terms. unfortunately, all my courage was used on my last relationship where i confessed at the valentines dance (i haven't been able to live up to that since. my legs were literally weak lol..).\n\nso, this year, i started liking guys too. this wasn't bad when i was liking guys from different schools cause there was little to no risk involved! but, unfortunately, being into your best friend has consequences...\n\nthe thing is, as much as i try (and i've definitely improved), i'm not outgoing enough to be as forward as i want. i don't want to make him uncomfortable or scare him off by testing his boundaries. like, seriously, simply touching him has me anxious. i think this stems from overthinking?? but it's not something i can immediately fix. so i'm an ambivert, but i have crippling anxiety and overthink everything i do. my friend, too, is an overthinker.... with terrible anxiety. i don't think the people i talk to about this ever actually understand how he is (nor do they understand my lack of capabilities \ud83d\udc94), so i'll try to paint a picture for you.\n\nhe's, what, sixteen, and he's quiet. the type to avoid confrontation and is sensitive. he's cried in front of me!! his first language isn't english, and he struggles with it (which is totally endearing, i love him), and he's a terribly dry texter. he's also autistic, so i'm afraid he may not pick up on the hints?? he's a dork\u2014likes anime, games, the whole shtick. BUT he's had bad experiences with dating before (the last two did not go smoothly), and now he's really... apprehensive to it ^_^;. i don't think he's into romance n dating and it honestly breaks my heart a bit. i've tried to pry a little to see if he's into someone, but he refuses (and i can't even know if he likes me because i'm scared to tell anyone because they're all big-mouthed and he's not forward enough to say \"yeah, i like someone\" when i ask if he DOES like me? like, help!!!!). whenever someone teases and says we'd be a good couple, he.. says no. and he's actually so hard to read, i have no idea if he's genuinely repulsed by the idea or is just flustered! \n\ni, um, also may have.. made a mistake when trying to ask him to be my valentine??? it was a picture of some cheap, stupid chucky figure from walmart, and i said something along the lines of \"would you say yes if i asked you to be my valentine w this or would you tell me to kms??\" cause, like, i wanted a way to play it off as a joke just in case, yk?? he replies with \"wdym\" and i go on to say that some rando in walmart rejected it and how it was... a rizzy proposal (true story btw)... and again asked if he would reject it as well, to which he says \"i think the chucky looks great \ud83d\udc4d\" and i'm afraid i gave mixed signals. like, terribly mixed signals. he DID go on to tell his friend (we'll refer to him as A) about it, and A said that he was CERTAIN it was romantic. he goes on to play fortnite with A and J (my bestest friend ever, who is a real one..), and A insists that he tell J what happened, and he finally caves and tells her n shows her the texts. J says that it COULD have been platonic, cause she's going to get me out of the hole i dug for myself \ud83d\ude2d. so, that failed.\n\ni like to think that i'm special because he lets me take pictures of him when he really hates that, but he lets J do the same. i also like to think it's nice he trusts me enough to confide in me and even cry in front of me, but again... he has done the same with J. i love J, she's literally my best friend (like a sister, she's at my house every weekend, every break), but he is so CONFUSING! he plays fortnite with her, calls her occasionally, talks to her out of school, but barely talks to me. i don't want to be delusional and think that it's just because he's too shy, but i don't want to already feel defeat and convince myself he'll never ever like me. there was one time he asked me if i wanted to play with him, but my ps4 controller was dead and it takes forever to update an app, so i had to decline \ud83d\ude1e.\n\nthere was one occasion where we were in the bus and we had just arrived at the football stadium for marching band cause it was an away game, and he sat in front of me. i was resting my cheek on the seat and he was like \"you're cute rn, BUT NOT IN A WEIRD WAY.\" which was honestly really confusing. i wasn't into him back then, but it was the first compliment a guy had ever given me, and ugh... he's just so sweet. he's really considerate and i like that communication with him isn't really hard. there was another instance where we were going door to door for a fundraiser for band with A (we all live near each other), and i didn't realize A had to be home early. we had reached the last house at the end of the road and i was talking to them when i look behind me and they're... walking away??? without warning?? it was really confusing and it upset me a lot more than i thought because i was WATCHING THEM RUN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION \ud83d\ude2d. he does eventually call to say A had to be home early and asks if i'm okay, and of course i'm stupid so i say yes... i did eventually own up to being upset and it was really easy to talk to him about it, but he's always so apologetic and sweet \ud83d\ude1e.\n\nhe also texted me one day and asked why i was so nice to him, because apparently he had done so much wrong. he also said he didn't know if he was overthinking, but that he didn't know if i hated him (if only he knew the truth omg \ud83d\ude2d)??? like?? i don't know if that's of any relevance, but i'm just putting it here.\n\nJ.. also told me.. last fall (i think) he had found a huge leaf, and he was going to take a picture of it before a friend of ours literally crushed it to pieces. she said that she wasn't supposed to tell anyone, but that he was going to take a picture for some guy that he was... apparently.. talking to because it reminded him of this mystery guy. he's bi, i know that, but i didn't take him for the type to go for someone who's not in the same state? i don't think he's talking to anyone as of now, though.\n\nnow, i've been trying to be.. somewhat forward. i compliment him, say he's cute on occasion, yada yada, but what do i actually do?? touching him just feels so... scary. i've touched him here and there, even tried combing his hair when A asked if anyone wanted to, but he awkwardly walked away!! not only is it terribly out of MY comfort zone, i don't want to make him uncomfortable too. the reason for my hesitance is because i have so, so much to lose. not only do i wish he were my boyfriend, i really value our friendship, and i'd hate to ruin that or make things awkward between us. with guys from other schools, i wasn't as hesitant and awkward because i didn't have years of a friendship already built, we just talked, but things are so complicated now. \n\ni really, really don't know what to do, but i don't want to regret doing nothing at all. :(",

I barely spoke to him, but thought he was cute and ended up having a crush on him for an embarrassingly long time tbh. As a joke, I added him on Snapchat through a fake account, not with the intention of chatting with him; i just wanted to see his bitmoji and snap score or whatever since i was stalking him a lot.\n\nFast forward to now, like three years later\u2014he suddenly added me back and snapped the fake account. Out of boredom since i\u2019m home for summer break and had absolutely nothing to do, I snapped back with pictures of a girl on tiktok (that looked like the fake bitmoji) and pretended to be her. I assumed he\u2019d catch on quickly, but instead he kept going and we ended up having long, personal conversations. i would\u2019ve ended it faster but he was drunk and alone in nyc in the middle of the night so i felt like i couldn\u2019t leave and had to give him company, and ngl he got very into the conversation and wanted to wife me up and everything. The whole thing escalated into something emotional and surreal. He wanted to call the next day so i knew i had to cut it off, but instead of just unadding him like i should\u2019ve, i also felt kind of bad since he was so vulnerable, so I wrote some messages saying i wasn\u2019t who i actually was and i was trolling him, to which he was very understanding and chill about. but something in me so badly wanted me to tell him who i actually was, like it was eating away at me. my sister kept telling me not to and that it was a bad idea, mainly because of the fact that he\u2019d tell his mom or he\u2019d react in a way that would hurt me. but, i wrote a whole heartfelt and honestly embarrassing message about who i actually was, that i liked him at some point, and the reasons for why i did what i did. Once again, he was surprisingly kind and didn\u2019t tell his parents (our families know each other), but I\u2019m so deeply embarrassed and honestly wish i never told him who i actually was, not because of his reaction (that was very nice) but because of how embarrassed i am. I don\u2019t know what to do now. He hasn\u2019t opened my last message, and I feel sick with regret and anxiety. This is so unlike me and so immature of me to do, and the worst part is i wouldn\u2019t have revealed anything if i didn\u2019t actually have some feelings for him after that conversation and just this whole experience in general.\n\nI\u2019m 18 and feel like I made a huge mistake that I can\u2019t undo. I feel so terrible, ashamed, embarrassed, and really can\u2019t believe that it ever got to this point. If i was busy and in school i would\u2019ve never opened the snap; this was out of my own selfish boredom and my unfulfilled crush that was brought back after being a relic of the past. The only saving grace is that our moms haven\u2019t talked to each other in months and may not \u201cmake up\u201d anytime soon, so i may not have to see them again and live down that level of awkwardness.",

I have terrible social skills and i'm always afraid of talking to girls and say something weird or boring and be embarrassed. I'm really insecure about my apperence and body. My therepist say i have a beautiful face, but i'm a chubby guy and i know that a lot of woman don't like that. I always feel sad and lonely when i see happy couples doing cute things everywhere, including one of my friends who is in a really cute relationship. I just wanna experince this, been loved and feel love for someone, but it's so difficult ",

        "post-author": "FR33_NikolaiXOXOBSD",
        "text": "I need help!!\n\nI also need advice!! Does my crush like me? For context we met at an art club thing, he's a year older than me, we're young, he's autistic and has anxiety/ADHD and these r some things he does\n\n1. He\u2019s made long-term plans with me, not just stuff like \u201csee you tomorrow,\u201d but things that involve the future\u2014like things we might do together later, as if he\u2019s already imagining I\u2019ll still be in his life.\n\n\n2. He told me I\u2019m the person he\u2019s made the most eye contact with, which means a lot coming from him since he\u2019s autistic and making eye contact is usually hard. That tells me I make him feel comfortable and safe.\n\n\n3. He fidgets a lot around me, which might just be part of his ADHD/autism, but I noticed it\u2019s especially when we\u2019re close or when he\u2019s excited to talk to me, like he can\u2019t sit still because he\u2019s happy or nervous.\n\n\n4. He gives me really thoughtful gifts, not just random things. One time, I said I liked deer\u2014and later he gave me a deer plushie. That kind of remembering and personal effort shows he listens and cares deeply.\n\n\n5. He talks to me a lot, like way more than he talks to anyone else. Whether we\u2019re in person or texting, he keeps the conversation going and seems to want to keep me engaged.\n\n\n6. He trusts me with everything, even heavy stuff. He\u2019s opened up about his life, his feelings, and his mental health\u2014stuff he doesn\u2019t tell many people. It\u2019s like he sees me as his safe space.\n\n\n7. He\u2019s nice and loud around me, in a way that feels full of energy and joy. It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t feel like he has to mask around me. He shows his full self and even gets silly, which I love.\n\n\n8. He once told me about his struggles with his sister, things at home, and his mental health, and I was there for him through it. He made me feel like I made a difference, like I helped him feel supported.\n\n\n9. He said that one time when we played Roblox together, it actually helped him decide not to hurt himself. He told me later that my presence and friendship helped him that day\u2014even though I didn\u2019t know it at the time. That meant the world to me.\n\n\n10. During a game of Truth or Dare, he said he has no secrets he hasn\u2019t told me. That kind of trust is rare, and it felt like he was saying I already know the deepest parts of him.\n\n\n11. When I went on holiday, he texted me \u201cI miss you\u201d or \u201cI missed you\u201d multiple times. It was unprompted, sincere, and made me feel like he really noticed I was gone.\n\n\n12. Even when he\u2019s busy or offline, he replies to me when he checks WhatsApp at the end of the day. He doesn\u2019t forget, and he makes an effort to talk to me even if it\u2019s late.\n\n\n13. He always sits by me and talks to me at art group, like it\u2019s automatic\u2014he doesn\u2019t even look for another seat. He just finds me. It\u2019s like I\u2019m his default person.\n\n\n14. He mirrors my affection, like when I called him \u201cpookie\u201d and said I\u2019d pause my music for him (even though I love music), he replied saying he\u2019d pause his music for me too and called me \u201cpookie\u201d back.\n\n\n15. He said he\u2019d ship any characters I ship, even if he doesn't care about them, just because I care. That shows how loyal and supportive he is of my interests.\n\n\n16. We have inside jokes together, the kind that only make sense to us. It makes our bond feel unique and special, like our own little world.\n\n\n17. He uses silly, sweet, or even flirty emojis when texting me, like \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 or exaggerated reactions like \u201cLOL,\u201d and always keeps the tone fun and connected.\n\n\n18. He continues conversations even when he doesn\u2019t know what I meant, like when I said \u201cverbatim\u201d and he didn\u2019t know what it was\u2014he still replied and kept the tone light instead of stopping the convo.\n\n\n19. He consistently chooses me\u2014talking to me, sitting with me, texting me, trusting me\u2014again and again, even when he has other options. That constant effort feels like more than just a \u201cbestie.\u201d\n\n\n\nDoes he like me?? I need advice!! ",

He's neurodivergent which changes his view of social norms. \n\nHe probably isn't trying to indicate attraction, just initiate a geniune bond with you as someone he dearly trusts. Most neurodivergent affection is misjudged as 'flirting' and to me- as a suspected autistic person- sees these behaviours as fully platonic too.\n\nYour comment here makes me bat an eye though. He might like you back. Maybe he just really trusts you, obviously I can't tell through a screen.\n\nTry asking him about it, but don't make it a big thing. Such as asking for tone tags when he says something that you think is flirting. Be especially careful because he has anxiety and he could start to overthink on how you perceive him.\n\nI wish you well!",

The only difficulty is with swallowing at the end-not because of the taste, but because the amount and thickness can make it feel like it gets stuck in the throat.\n\nShe says it\u2019s not a big problem and continues to choose this, but I want to be considerate and not push beyond comfort. My main questions:\n\nDoes this get easier or feel more normal with time and experience (1yr past)?\n\nOr is it something that might become uncomfortable or tiring in the long run?\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this, and how did you handle it?\n\nI want to keep things positive and comfortable for both of us, so I\u2019d really appreciate any advice or shared experiences from others who\u2019ve navigated this situation.",

I don't think girls like my type of body, which would immediately make me out of their radar. Like, i'm doing exercise and eating healthy, but getting skin it's not the easiest thing in the world. Like, it's really impossible for me to find real love in the way i'm now? My parents always says that i look like my uncle, since his also shy and don't talk much.

You're talking about women like they're an alien species on a pedestal high up from you. I get it, I was young once, and it felt very alienating to attempt to talk to women in a romantic way. \n\nHaving a girlfriend is generally a more intimate and close relationship than one with a casual friend. Are you friends with any girls? Like truly friends, and not there for the possibility of a romantic relationship? If you aren't, then I would first ask how that can change and why you aren't friends with any in that capacity. In this day and age, there's so many people and communities that it's kinda easy to come across people who share your interests and also are into you physically. Being chubby isn't really a big deal, and I'd focus more on your insecurity regarding it. Attitude is a lot, and if you can or have the option to, go to therapy regarding your insecurities. You'd be surprised at how charming confidence can be. \n\nYou sound on the younger side, and thus you have plenty of time. Focus on yourself, and people will surround you (generally). If you're really really shy, maybe start going to small events like a local book club or join an online community and just focus on forming meaningful friendships, but don't be one of those people who falls in love with every friend they make. That's creepy. Do this to focus on getting confidence with your social interactions. This is all really general advice I can provide without knowing more. Feel free to DM me if you'd like.",

It\u2019s also plausible that I am overthinking things, but if this is the case, how do I get over it? This is my most serious relationship so I don\u2019t know what to do.

Being in these situations myself before. The things I learnt that are best to do are the following:\n\n\\-REFRAME WHAT YOU SAY: Its all about how u say it, not really what u say. You know your partner better than anyone else, so youre gonna know what kind of words they listen to best. if youve said the right thing the wrong way, theyre gonna take it as \"wow youre saying the wrong thing in the worst way\"\n\n\\-SAYING WHAT MATTERS: If you know what you have to say is hard to take, cut out the bullshit, just give it to them in the cleanest most forward way possible. imagine youre trying to buy a new car and the sales person is talking about the color, the leather seats, the rubber used in tires, you dont give a fuck about that.. you want to know the mileage, the fuel capacity, the price. The things that matter stick out more.\n\n\\-LET YOUR PARTNER KNOW THAT YOU ARE SAYING WHAT YOUR SAYING FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE RELATIONSHIP: if you are both mature, in love and willing to have the tough talks for eachother then you have to let your partner know than what youre saying is not out of spite, its out of love\n\n(TL DR): say what u have to say the right way, make it clear and prescise, let them know that its mutually beneficial.\n\nrelationships have times like this, these talks are necessary, good luck :)  \nand in conclusion, no, dont hold back the truth from your partner, it doesnt help either of you",

It\u2019s been a slow burn and I\u2019m confident that I am considered more than just a friend to them as well but there are complications that are casting some doubt for both of us.\nUltimately, this person has reignited something in me and I love being around them.\nOne complication, and the reason I\u2019m posting, is that they are going overseas for an extended period (six months or so). I have written a song for them, I guess you could call it a love song, and I want to know if/when I should play it for them. Even if things didn\u2019t pan out romantically (hopefully we could remain friends) I would still want them to know I have written this song for them and to have it (or have heard it). I would be flattered if this was ever done for me. \n\nSo, questions:\n1. If you were this person, would you want to know, and hear the song?\n2. Should I respectfully wait until they return? Risking that they don\u2019t, or they meet someone, I meet someone, you know, time and space changes things.\nOr do it before they leave? Shooting my shot so to speak but then risking the timing being wrong such that things are awkward and then any form of relationship ends. This also feels selfish regarding their feelings in response to the gesture (positive or negative). I genuinely want them to go and have an amazing time without strings attached.\n\nYou can tell which way I\u2019m leaning but keen to hear what others would do and/or how\u2019d they\u2019d feel in this situation.",

That way you'll know if you should move on from this, which reminds me, do it while making sure of two things :\n\n1 - having a definite response from them (yes or no) no maybe's, that's the worst.\n\n2 - Be genuine, the way you say something is way more important than the message itself.\n\n\nAlso, i just realised i responded to your second question.

My advice is get clear with one another about your expectations and boundaries, but be prepared to find out that you guys are not in the same place with one another. Don\u2019t try to manipulate her to change and don\u2019t let her try to invalidate your boundaries. If the relationship is not going to work end it respectfully and move on.

It was fun, we met there and he gave me a candy ring and asked me to be his girlfriend. It was really sweet. Tell her she's super pretty, give her a single rose and say that you'd love to take her on a date but would like to know what she'd like to do. Suggest meet at a movie or cafe close by.  Keep an eye out for things like school dances or other events where a bunch of you will be going. Once you start the conversation, maybe she will have some ideas you haven't thought of.

        "text": "Wow I don't even know where to begin - Here goes nothin'... So I'm in a committed relationship with a man, whom when I first started seeing told me and introduced me to a very close female friend of his. They have been friends for years and years. Like 15 years I think ... He told me they are just close friends and hang out from time to time. I said that's okay, I don't want to be the jealous and controlling girlfriend and so it's fine. Well, as time continues, I began to notice things in her behavior that I forsaw as a possible threat. She has always been very straightforward about her feelings. She told me she sees my boyfriend like a brother and that is it. However, her behavior, coupled with some other concerning details, had my Spidey senses going nuts. To me it looked like she was in love with my boyfriend and harboured some very deep and complex emotions towards him. It became very clear to me that I needed to make sure I was extra careful with her, and not break down all my walls around her. To give some examples of her concerning behavior that has lead me to believe she wasn't being completely forth coming with her true feelings - her words don't match her actions. For example, she would always say she wished I would come out and hangout with them when she was over. However, when I would do that, her behavior was so strange and off-putting. She would tense up in my presence, she became withdrawn, and nervous and just seems very aware of how she was perceiving herself. To me, it didn't look like she actually truly wanted me to be there. So there is that, and then there is the commentary. If my boyfriend would not be available or something, and it happens couple times in a row, she would say something very emotionally charged back to him, something along the lines of, \"if you want me to stop coming over just tell me and I will stop.\" That struck me as so odd to say that, if she views him in a \"platonic\" light. More over, she would also say things like, say she text him to hang out, he says sure, I'm home, and mentions I'm home to. Her response sometimes would be, \"Oh okay, I will come another time, I don't want to upset Allie \" - (I am Allie btw) so yeah that was weird. Kind of made me feel like she was being kinda manipulative, and using a tactic to try to make me look like I'm the jealous, girlfriend, who gets mad when she comes over. Another very concerning thing she would do is drive by the house sometimes if my boyfriend told her he wasn't home to hangout. To check if his car was in the driveway. Which I felt was very very possessive of her. There also was a stark contrast in her behavior when I was present and when I wasnt present. I have  cameras inside my home. So my phone notifies me if there is movement in my living room. When I wasn't home, and she didn't think I could see, she was so relaxed, laughing, joking, happier, flirty even. She stayed over at my house longer and it was just such a huge huge difference to what I saw when I was there. She also seemed to be timing her visits so that she was purposely coming to my house, during the times I would be at work. It was like clock work, I go to work, not even an hour into my shift, Im getting notifications that movement was detected in my living room, and what do ya know, there she would be. Countless times. She was Always very nice to me and very polite, she always \"had my back\" on matters. But as time went on I began to stop trusting that facade . Because that's what I felt it was. A facade. A behavior to make me take my guards down and trust and view her as the innocent platonic friend. I saw through it. My gut instincts were telling me something was very off and she couldn't be fully trusted. She is also married by the way, and always runs to my boyfriend to let out her steam about how much she hates her husband. So I knew that she was very emotionally attached to my bf, but I was always very confused on her true emotions. I felt like I knew but I just wasn't really certain. I finally told my boyfriend that I do not want her coming over unless I'm home. Not to be controlling or anything but for my peace of mind, and clarity. He is my boyfriend after all. Lol well she immediately violated my boundary and so did he, and came over when I wasn't home. Do there's that to. So fast forward to the present- \n\nIt became clear to me that my boyfriend wasn't being completely forth coming about things. Which I felt I needed to figure a way to find out what he is hiding. I was able to make it where his messages would go to my phone. Idk if I'm wrong for that or not, but it's something I felt I needed to do. So anyways, I'm sitting in my room, and decided to see what messages he has. Top row is her name, and the message I can see from the message list without it being open, is \"I'm here\" timed not even 30 min prior to that. I felt my heart drop to my stomach, because, he told me he was going to work not to meet her. And they both knew I didn't want them alone with each other. So I open the messages up, and her response is, okay come to the side by Jamie's room. (Her son) \n\n*I remember even saying out loud* WHOA WTF IS GOING ON HERE? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. I was so taken back. Why is he at her house??? So I jump in my car , and drive right to her house, I couldn't even remember her address as I have only been there twice, but fate took me there. Now my behavior that day was led by my hurt, betrayal, and anger towards them. I walked straight in her home, I was going to go down the hall her room, but ti remembered her having a shed in the backyard that her uncle would stay in when visits, so redirected myself towards the back, and she came flying out. I said WTF IS GOING ON HERE? I walk in the shed, and my boyfriend is hold a drill or something like he was fixing something. I flipped them off a couple times, she kept trying to hush me, because she didn't want her kids to hear, (like I gave a crap right?) she tried to close the door and keep me in there with them, but I pushed my way past her and out the door. I left. When I got home I texted her and I let everything I out, and I mean everything, also something I am not exactly proud to say I did, but I did and what is done is done. Instead of her taking any accountability in the incident, she told me some nasty things, and basically took absolutely no responsibility for her part in the matter. Which is crazy to me. When my boyfriend got home he told me that she had called him and asked if he could come help her out up a closet in her shed for her son. And so he did, but it doesn't take away from the fact that it was secret. It was hidden and it just felt all wrong. Now I'm here and my boyfriend and I are most likely breaking up over this. He just defends her and speaks of her like a damn saint, and it makes me sick. He fails to see how she is in love with him and everything is just so wrong. My question to everyone reading this is actually a couple questions. .\n\nDo you believe I was wrong for going to her house the way I did? \n\nDo you think I am justified in feeling the way I feel, and reacting the way I did? \n\nDo you think they were wrong? \n\nDo you think from the info I have provided about her, that she harbors feelings romantically for my boyfriend? \n\nAnd last, do you believe she is someone I can call a friend or do you believe I should this woman as threat to my relationship? \n\nThank you, please I really need some advice and opinions \n",

        "text": "This has been an ongoing trend in my romantic life. For the context, I\u2019m a 23F and I just graduated college. I\u2019ve been wondering how everyone is able to tell whether they are actually in love or not. \n\nI can give you a couple examples: \n\n1. last guy I dated, we were dating for over a year but we never labeled ourselves bf/gf. After a year and a half passed being on & off, we decided to cut off contact for a bit to end things. I was really worried about being heart broken; but surprisingly, after a few days I realized I was completely fine & I had completely lost feelings for this guy who was practically my boyfriend until a few days ago. I could tell it had been a long time since I lost feelings- but I had kept up with texting everyday & thinking about him everyday as if I still had feelings for him up until the break. I was so confused what these feelings I was feeling were- if they were not love, what were they?\n\n2. I recently had a huge crush on this guy for 3 days. I only knew of him as my friend\u2019s friend, but I saw him on a work trip on the 1st day and we had a good chat, and I got interested in him. But my feelings were so intense on the following days- I was putting a lot of effort into getting ready for work and I got really excited every time I saw him or had an opportunity to chat with him, as if I\u2019m in love with him. I stayed up thinking about him even. Then I found out he had a gf on the third day, and my feelings that were so intense up until that moment evaporated completely. Looking back, I get so confused what the intense feeling I was feeling was, because how was I feeling so intense for a guy I barely knew? My feelings literally evaporated the moment I found out he has a gf- clearly the feelings didn\u2019t need to be so intense. \n\n3. The same thing happened with another guy after dating him for a month. I realized I was not interested at all, although I had firmly believed I was interested in him & communicated so. He got really upset and told me I had led him on- which I could kind of understand. But I thought I had feelings in the moments I told him so. \n\n4. The opposite also has happened- my ex boyfriend of 3 years, I couldn\u2019t tell if I liked him or not for a year before we started dating. I had gone on dates with other people thinking I didn\u2019t like him, but there was this underlying weird feeling every time I saw him or talked to him. It took me a while until I realized that feeling was romantic for him, which almost jeopardized my chance of dating him- he thought I was not interested at all and was sending mixed signals. It wasn\u2019t my intention to send mixed signals, but thinking back, I can tell I had caught feelings for him a lot earlier on & was sending mixed signals (sometimes I acted true to my romantic feelings without realizing the feeling, sometimes I followed my brain thinking I didn\u2019t have any romantic feelings & went out with other people). \n\nMy questions are: \nWhat are those feelings I keep feeling that make me think I\u2019m in love? How do people know when they actually romantic feelings for someone or not? \n\nPlease help me out! I can\u2019t take anymore roller coaster of making myself believe I\u2019m in love when I\u2019m not & vice versa!",

First her phone has parental controlls so she cant give me her phone number. this is a problem because most people say to ghost your crush to get out of  the friendzone. if i dont have her number how can i ghost her only in person (she is in all of my classes except one). or how do i escape the friend zone without ghosting her. thank you for any responses.

He feels lied to because I have told him I have cum to him and have now backtracked those statements. I don\u2019t know what to think anymore or what to do. Any thoughts or advice on how we can work on this or can we work on this?",

We are really close and happy together and we talk a lot and have pretty good communication. I love her a lot and I accept her sexual preferences. She has had both girlfriends and boyfriends in the past but she didn\u2019t really go that far with any of them at least thats what she told me. \n I know she would never cheat on me and everything but she often makes remarks and jokes about her being gay/ bi a lot it doesn\u2019t really make me angry or anything she\u2019s funny sometimes when she makes those type of comments but it does make me feel uncomfortable and slightly embarrassed when she says things like that. Idk if it\u2019s because if I\u2019m insecure or something like that. I have told her in the past how I feel and granted she has slightly toned down the comments but she makes them a lot. I love her and I don\u2019t want to make her upset about anything but idk how to handle this situation. Please don\u2019t say anything like dump her or get over it I just need advice to have a mature conversation with her about it thank you \n",

I\u2019d like to preface this post by saying I am a relatively confident/secure person. \n\nMy bf and I have been together for 7mos. A couple months ago I found out that his type is the complete opposite of me by a comment his mom made about being surprised I was blonde. I asked my bf about that later and he said that his type has always been brown hair, brown eyes, with tan skin. He said he use to tell his parents he\u2019d never date someone blonde. I have blonde hair, pretty fair skin and green eyes, so obviously I was initially really taken aback from that explanation, but he assured me that was before he met me. I can tell he\u2019s attracted to me, but this has always been stuck in the back of my head, and I have expressed that to him. He says that he loves me and couldn\u2019t imagine himself with anyone else. \n\nA couple days ago I was on his phone because mine was dead. I was going to look something up on Reddit, and his search history consisted of certain videos of Latinas. He was sitting next to me, so I turned his phone and showed him. He started apologizing, but I had to remove myself from the situation because I couldn\u2019t even tell what I was thinking. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve just told him that idk how I\u2019m supposed to continue with this relationship knowing that he has fantasies about and prefers girls that look completely opposite of me. I told him that I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be completely satisfied with me in the long run, and I think I\u2019ll always be insecure about this in the relationship now. He just said that that\u2019s not true and I\u2019m all he wants. \n\nIk we haven\u2019t been together very long, but I do love and care about him a lot, and ik he feels the same way. Should I end things or am I being insecure and unreasonable?",

I (25m) have a major crush on this boy (21m) who works with me at the library. In fact, it\u2019s kind of misleading to say we work together, because we rotate our shifts; if I\u2019m at the library, that means he\u2019s not there and vice-versa. We met when we were applying for the job at the university library 6 months ago and ever since I\u2019ve had a big crush on him, but we could never move things further. I have no idea if he\u2019s even gay or bi, and I am way too shy to interact with him when we meet on campus because he\u2019s always surrounded by friends, which intimidates me. He is not in my year, so we don\u2019t go to any of the same classes and so I feel like I can never have a good chance to talk or get to know each other better. Recently, there was a library event and we had to work together to prepare something for it, and that gave us like an hour of 1 to 1 interaction for the first time and yet I really feel like that wasn\u2019t a good opportunity to do get to know him better, since it was kind of professional. Once, we both went to a party on campus and I felt like he was kind of circling around me, but I was a bit too uncertain to approach him. I feel like it\u2019s a bit dangerous to do that with other boys even nowadays, cause of homophobia. Does anyone have any idea of what I can do to become closer to him? Having that 1 on 1 time with him really messed with my head, made me feel like im wasting time with shyness when I should just ask him out, but I really don\u2019t have the guts to do it like that, all of a sudden.

Asking him for his contact info won't feel weird to him if he isn't gay/bi cause tbh straight guys are clueless. So if you are ever working at the same time just mention a book you like or just some other light question. Maybe just say something like \"i was going to text and say im gonna be late but i realized i dont even follow you on instagram/have your number\" it all depends on your personality i think. Because he won't think anything of it unless he is gay/bi. And if he is thats just good for you and will probably make him think \"did he just want my number for convenience or does he have a thing for me?\"",

Me and Kai have had a class together and have been studying together resulting in a great friendship. But eventually I realized that I was bisexual, and I was in love with him. I've been straight my entire life, probably because all of my family (except me) are Catholic. I absolutely hate my sexuality since I have always disliked the LGBTQ community. I don't mind those who are queer but I have always queer culture. I am almost certain he does not feel the same but I can't help feel the way I do. It doesn't help that Kai is honestly one of the best people l've ever met.

If he does not return these feelings then it\u2019s likely to create an awkwardness in the friendship that will eventually lead to its demise. This is not because it\u2019s a man with feelings for another man. It\u2019s true in any friendship where one has romantic feelings and the other doesn\u2019t. It just becomes awkward. People start avoiding each other. The friendship just breaks down.     \n\nUnrequited love is not a rare thing. Many of us have experienced and had to accept those desires of our heart just were not meant to be. It\u2019s a hard thing. But something else will come along that will help to salve that wound.      \n\nThere\u2019s no point in feeling any self hatred. You feel what you feel and you are who you are. Sexuality exists on a spectrum. Kai may be the only man you ever form romantic feelings for, or there may be others in the future. It may too soon to label yourself as any one thing. You may want to take some time to explore yourself feelings. Give yourself grace. Take the time you need. Work towards shaking things out at an honest place with yourself.",

        "text": "I (18F) recently went through a breakup with my boyfriend (19M), and I\u2019m honestly still in shock and so hurt by everything that happened. We were together for several months, and it felt so real. He was my first everything, and I really thought we were building something long-term. We talked about moving in together, having a future, and I even started making big decisions for us\u2014like looking for apartments near him and canceling plans for my gap year in Italy because I wanted to be with him.\n\nBut then, things changed. Over time, he started pulling away, and it later turned out that he just wanted some space. i would\u2019ve loved to give him space if he would\u2019ve told me about that. He also admitted that he should\u2019ve just talked and then things wouldn\u2019t have ended that way. We ended up arguing, and I confronted him about how I felt. I shared that I had opened up to him in ways I never had with anyone else, and I was so emotionally invested. I even told him that I was thinking about moving closer to him and was imagining a life with him, which is something I\u2019ve never shared with anyone else before.\n\nDespite this, he broke up with me, saying that he didn\u2019t love me anymore. But after some more talking, he told me that he is scared that breaking up was a mistake, not the relationship itself. This makes me so confused, because it feels like he\u2019s unsure about everything. He still has some of my things at his house and promised to keep cuddling the pillow I made for him. He also said he\u2019d still ask about my driving license and wish me a happy birthday, which makes me feel like there\u2019s still some care there.\n\nI did a lot with him and his family like long car drives with singing and them telling me that they have found \u201cmy song\u201d, which whenever they\u2019ll play it now they\u2019ll think of me. His parents have an additional apartment which isn\u2019t used anymore and while our last talk he told me about it and told me he wanted to move on there with me. His parents were part of a big community of people who often met up. He introduced me to all of these people including his godfather. They introduced me to join them the next time and he was already planning on bringing me along to one of their camps and wanted to surprise me with it. He never told anybody, not even his best friend, about this community because he is kind of embarrassed by it. He told me about it on our second date. \n\nI\u2019m stuck. I feel like I\u2019m holding on to a hope that he might come back, but I\u2019m also questioning if I\u2019m just holding on because I can\u2019t accept that it\u2019s over. I wrote him a letter where I poured my heart out about all the memories and the future I imagined with him. I don\u2019t know if I should send it or if I\u2019m just setting myself up for more pain. I\u2019m lost and don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing the right thing by waiting for him to figure things out, or if I should just let go and move on.\n\nMy heart physically hurts, and I feel numb when I\u2019m not distracted by something. I\u2019m struggling with the idea of never seeing him again, but I also don\u2019t want to wait around in limbo if he\u2019s not sure about wanting me in his life anymore.\n\nHe texted me today that he likes me so i asked him \u201cdo you want space and then we\u2019ll star again? but from the very beginning\u201d he hasn\u2019t responded yet\n\nI need advice",

Our talking topics are usually very sex-oriented, but I haven't minded it 'cause I like that kind of humor as well, and it's not like we talk about personal stuff.\n\nAnyways, I think one of them has started to see me differently or something, because I just got a text out of the blue saying \"you're nice :)\", and my gut is telling me that it's either a confession or he's gonna confess.\n\nThe thing is that I have no interest in this person. Also I don't know everyones ages, but I'm pretty sure he's at least around 15 years older (which is already way past my limit). But I also cannot ghost him 'cause we have same courses and the groups in them are really small, so no way of avoiding conversations in school.\n\nI guess my question is: how can I clearly put him in the friend zone so that we can continue to coexist and to be able to study in the same groups in the future? And I also don't need him to get any closer to me than he is now.\n\nI think I could manage face to face, but I have no idea how to do so over a text, because I'm not sure what exactly is he thinking when sending that text.\n\nSo any appropriate advice is welcomed. I'd never thought that I'd be asking this on reddit, but all my friends are from school so I have no other way of asking anonymously.",

He's in no place to date if he's just gotten out of a breakup, so that means you've got some time to reflect on whether telling him anything will *achieve anything useful* (for example dating and it working out) or whether it would just complicate things...or whether in 3 weeks time you'll realise you don't have those feelings or don't think you can date him after all.\n\nThere's no rush.

I'm 18 and I'd say I began doing this when I was around 16. All of the emotions seem to fade away from me once I realize they want me to be their boyfriend. Friends-with-benefits type relationships I do just fine with even if they last a long time, but once they start getting all lovey-dovey I honestly just get a little annoyed even though know they haven't done anything wrong. I honestly thought I would've been the opposite, with me being the one who got ghosted, as I used to be a bit of a lonely loser who wished for a girlfriend. The weird part is I always enter these situations hoping that I'll make them my girlfriend, but the end result is always the same as described. I've talked to some of my friends about this and they say I'll probably just grow out of it. I want to believe them, but I honestly don't know.  None of my other friends seem to do this, at least to this extent. I've probably done this to at least 12 girls, some in person and some online. Should I be trying to fix this, or is this maybe just a weird part of me? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated : ) Feel free to say anything I don't mind",

(He tried hitting on me, but because I didn't block him right away as I saw him as a brother, my partner had issues. I see that I messed up by not blocking him sooner and regretting it. I saw him as a brother as I'd known him since I was 5 years old and didn't want to start family drama)\nWell, the argument led to my partner going to jail, and I was completely heartbroken as I thought the relationship was over.\nI hung out with a friend, and  unexpectedly, my brothers came over with the BFF. (I was letting one of my brothers stay with me at the time)\nNothing ever happened between the BFF and I, but my partner insisted that something did.\nNo matter how much closure I give or deny anything happening,my partner insists that something did. He's even gotten confirmation from the BFF and STILL won't accept that I'm innocent.\nI've been dealing with being accused of cheating for 4 years almost now, and he just keeps trying to puzzle any little thing together to make it make sense to him in his head.\nHe had BPD, and honestly, having to defend myself all the time is exhausting.\nI love him and have asked even why stay if you believe i cheated? His answer is because he wants closure and for me to admit to cheating.\nI can't give closure to something I've never done.\nI just want this all to stop. I'm tired of being accused and his rapid mood swings.\nIf i tell him I may consider leaving,he says it's only because im guilty and don't want to get caught. In reality, it's because Im burnt out and doesn't know how much more I can take.\nWe have a child together and one on the way,so everything is extra stressful right now as is.\n\nIf anyone has advice or suggestions on how to get support for myself, I'd greatly appreciate it. My partner refuses to get help. It's really putting a strain on our relationship and family.",

I know I'm ready to start dating again.\n\nCurrent situation- I feel like the current dating pool has been turning into something awful lately. I have no idea how to approach the really cute girl at the grocery store without her thinking I just want to hook up or something. I have no idea what to say to the beautiful woman who happened to be in the same business as me at the time without her thinking I just want to get in her pants. I don't want something superficial, but I feel like hookup culture has kind of ruined these kinds of experiences. I have tried some dating apps in the past, but it all seems to be: we match, we send 3-5 messages back and forth, then I never hear from em again. That's boring and awful.\n\nI guess I'm just looking for advice on how you would want a guy to approach you out in public that isn't off putting. Ideally, I'm looking for a real date and or to see if it goes somewhere serious. I have no fear of talking to a stranger in public, I just don't want to say or do something that makes things awkward or uncomfortable for anyone. Please feel free to comment/message me with any advice you might have.\n\nTLDR: What exactly should a guy say to a woman that he finds attractive without sounding like a creep/getting immediately shut down?\n\nAll comments/messages are welcome. Thanks in advance!",

Present)\n\nWe still talk a lot and my mom was hosting a party thing, she tells me I can invite one friend, I invite V she comes to my house and we play Roblox and hop on a Omegle esque site, we have fun she goes back home, and every week now we do something together either something small or big after school, we've gone shopping together ( we bought legos together and funko pops) and then we went out for boba the next week, and then we watched a movie another, we went to Denny's another week then we went walking to our friends school this week and we got ice cream.\n\nOk you're caught up now with the lore the thing is i always like her either a little either a lot never changes The fact in my eyes, she's really pretty, even if she doesn't think so and honestly after dating X, i don't know what i want in a relationship and if i would date V, i know she doesn't like me right off the bat i know her type and im not date, but genuinely dude we share so much in common and i have so much fun when we go out and we talk and do stuff for each other, we've gotten dating allegations we both say no firmly, because even still i don't know what i want, i know i do want trust though, I've gained so much trust for V it's what making me think this, I don't think im in love because i say in my head i don't like her and its me being lonely and she's just a friend but genuinely, I don't know if im in love, but i think im close, she's just so amazing, fun, funny and she has pretty black eyes and hair, she might be short and complain about how she looks but in my eyes she's the cutest girl i've ever seen in my life , i wish i could tell her this i know i could never leave the friend zone, but genuinely she's just so amazing, i don't wanna ruin anything i like being friends like this and even still from my past relationships i still have to think about it ( my trust issues have got bad bad), but even still she stoops higher then what i expect in my trust everytime and she's just so kind i know she's just kind like this no special treatment, i just want to treat her nice you know? a walk through the park eating ice cream and laughing holding hands and resting head on shoulder, something like that, that's what i feel with her what i want to do she's just so amazing it feels weird venting all of this, but for now I'm fine being good friends i just had to tell someone this, so ill tell this to Reddit.",

I presnt myself first, I\u2019m 22 and never been in couple, I\u2019m a medical student and I want some plot in my life. I\u2019m going to be very detailed on the next paragraph, you can skip if it doesn\u2019t interest you.\n\nI saw him for the first time the first day at the University. He was in the front row and asked to airdrop the slides of the course. As he just looked back to ask I was so surprised by his beauty. To maka an image he\u2019s a tall black man with perfect skin, beautiful feature and good style. Timegoes by and we talked a little 2-3 times shortly. One time he winked at me but I heard that guys can wink to everybody and it doesn\u2019t mean anything. The problem is that he started to stop coming to the lessons so I didn\u2019t see him for a long time. The thing is that one day I had practical lesson and I saw him there. I didn\u2019t know why he was there because he wasn\u2019t on my group list but I think he just switched with somebody. THis day we talked the most together. At first he was not close to me but after a break he ask to sit next to me and I was happy. I shouldn\u2019t have done that but I left early because I had something to do but if I didn\u2019t maybe I would have spent more time with him. As I was departing this day he said to me that we would see each other on the first exam two weeks after. I was excited the D-day but didn\u2019t saw him all the exams sessions mostly because we are so apart from our surnames in the alphabet and the locations of the exams are distribued by this system. At the beginning of the seconde semester I saw him and one time we said hello and we did a bise (the french thing you know, because we did it too in Belgium where I live) and he placed his and on my shoulder doing it. It\u2019s ambigu to do that when we do the bise, it can be amical or something more idk. Today however we speak I little more but with other people.\n\nThe ting is I really want to know him and be friend with him before everything else if it\u2019s boundf to happen. But I don\u2019t kow how to come to him or do something to make him understand my interest. The problem is thet he doesn\u2019t seem to come to lessons often (never at a moment). I still have two weeks with maybe only some days where I can see him.\n\nThe objective is to have opportunitites, to talk to him and the best would be to have his ig to be able to take this to another step. I don\u2019t know how to do that\u2026 Do you have some ideas or just advices to help pleeeease ?\nI really want to do my best this time.\n\nThank you in advance <3",

        "text": "I am a 25-year-old male residing in the DeFacto zone of Cyprus, known officially as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. I am currently a university student studying civil aviation management. Throughout my life, I have never really experienced a fulfilling romantic relationship. My first relationship began in my hometown; we dated for about four months before I left to study abroad. During that time, we did not engage in sexual activities, as she was a virgin, and my strong religious beliefs meant I was saving myself for the right person. When I moved abroad, we ended up breaking up. It seemed there wasn't an apparent reason, but I later suspected she might have been seeing someone else. After our breakup, my suspicions were confirmed when I found out she indeed started dating another guy. I felt used, but I managed to move on.\n\nEventually, I met a girl who moved into the apartment next to mine. One day, when I wasn't working, she invited me over with what I believed were innocent intentions. However, things escalated unexpectedly. We were sitting on her bed because she didn\u2019t have a chair. Before I knew it, she began touching me, and things progressed quickly. We ended up having sex, despite my reluctance and shock. I couldn\u2019t fully comprehend how it all happened. The experience was uncomfortable, and I felt deep guilt afterward for betraying my values and what I had envisioned for my future with my eventual wife. That night, I cried myself to sleep. The next day, after attending school, I felt such regret and shame that I decided to move out of the apartment, even forfeiting half a month\u2019s rent.\n\nI later discovered she was older than me, which happened back in 2022 when I was 22 years old. Though I moved on, the experience left a lasting impact, and I unexpectedly developed a preference for older women, between the ages of 30 to 50, rather than someone my age. This newfound preference became quite strong, and I no longer saw myself dating younger women. Moreover, I have always been respectful and have never even entertained the idea of disrupting someone's relationship, so anyone I considered dating always seemed to already have a boyfriend.",

To be where you\u2019re at and to have had the experiences that allowed you to grow may have hurt at the moment, but will be something you are able to look back on in disbelief at how little you knew.  25 is barely the start of your life.

Years, often.\n\nMy only suggestion is that if you want a serious relationship, make that clear from the outset. Get better at sussing out people who are looking for more casual. Don't go along with casual in hopes that they'll like you enough to get serious. Be extremely forthright and don't waffle on your boundaries and expectations trying to avoid putting them off. If they skedaddle, it's because they aren't able to give you what you want. \n\nIf you're having sex right away, there's nothing morally wrong with that. Lots of people prefer to have sex immediately and that works out well for them. However, I will say that holding off on sex for a while was a good first-line filter to get at least the lazier time-wasters out of the way. The ones who are swiping just to add to the booty call roster. \n\nI got married young but that didn't actually give me the love I wanted. I ultimately didn't find love until I was close to 40. It was a long wait but a worthwhile one. We both wish we'd met earlier, but at the same time we know we probably wouldn't have been so perfect for each other without the time that passed before we crossed paths. We met when the time was the right time for us to meet.",

And he did so that she wouldn't leave him.\n\nI'm sorry you're hurt, but you must have also realized after 8yrs he was never going to leave his gf/wife/long-term partner. Why would you put yourself in that situation for 8 years? I think you deserve better than what you are describing as a 'relationship'. Don't you think you're worth more than being a side piece?\n\nYou need a real partner who will choose you over everything else, not someone who can't communicate with his wife/gf so he steps out on her. That's what he'll evebtually do to you too btw.\n\nWhile you think he owes you a conversation, he doesn't think much about it. He's too busy trying to save his own skin. Keep that in mind - you are 2nd in this relationship. You do not have power in it because you're the extra - you're a secret. I'm sorry this is harsh, but I just think you're barking up the wrong tree because the person up the tree has already jumped it to someone else's to prove he's 'loyal'. He's not.\n\nI think you deserve someone better than that guy and to have the ability to be open about your relationship rather than kept a secret all the time. Don't bother with that girlfriend , i bet you it's his wife.  She already knows who you are. She just gave him an ultimatum.\n\nHe's not loyal to you. You need to move on and let him go. I know easier said than done, but he's a jerk. Leading you and his partner on. Pretending to be loyal.\n\nPlease get therapy and work on yourself. You deserve better than this.",

And if he says he's not, he's lying. If he were really dedicated to you, he would have left his partner a long time ago (8yrs ago) and you both wouldn't be sneaking around.\n\nI think you need a clean sweep - a fresh start. Something that doesn't bring on so much heaviness and stress with your relationships and holding in all this information. Where you don't have to watch your words or who you text or where you go or how you spend your time.\n\nI just think you deserve a hell of a lot better than what he's giving you - which is breadcrumbs.

When I'm back working I want to show her how much I love and appreciate her support.\n\n\nFor context, I have been on sick leave from work since the start of December due to anxiety and depression caused by work. During this time I've been applying for other jobs and getting interviews. Between the stress and my ADHD I've found this time to be incredibly difficult. There are days where I struggle to get out of bed or do housework. I'm on medication for both but it's still been hard. \n\nEnter stage left the hero of this story: my wife. \n\nFinancially she makes more than me due to her career. To be clear, that is not nor has ever been a point of resentment or contention for me. She never hangs it over my head or makes fun of me because of it. She is highly intelligent and wise beyond her years. The reason I bring it up is that due to her, we are kept afloat between mortgage payments and bills. \n\nNaturally I don't want her to bare the burden alone. I interviewed for and received a job offer for a company that would have been incredibly difficult. While it wasn't ideal I felt at least that I can start pulling my weight again. And my absolutely selfless and caring wife said to me \"I don't want you to go from one bad place to another. I want to to work somewhere that you'll be happy and treated well\". Her main concern has always been how I'm doing, not what I'm doing. She works her 8 hour shift, comes home and the first thing she says is \"how are you today, hunnie\". \n\nSo with all that mushy stuff out of the way, I want to do something for her as a way to say \"Thank You\". Nothing I can do will come close but I want to try.\n\nMy idea, when I get back to work and our finances are good, is to surprise her on a Friday with a weekend away. I'd book her day off via her manager so that he would be aware of it. I asked feeler questions to her about where she'd like to go and got my answer. I'd then make an itinerary of stuff to do that she likes e.g. museums, spa day, city tours, etc. I'll also be picking up a part-time job which I will use the money from to pay for the trip so that it's coming directly out of my pocket. I'd get her \u20ac200 to go clothes shopping (might bring more based on clothes prices). \n\nBetween all that plus wine-ing and dining I'd like to think that would be a nice way to say thanks, but I'd like to know if anyone has any thoughts you have in mind?\n\nThank you for reading!\n",

She was not the chatty type, but when it was with me we could talk for hours about random things. \n\nShe let me walked her several times to her place after class, and it was quite long walk (40-60 minutes) and sometimes she let me walk her to the bus stop when she didn\u2019t feel like walking home. \n\nLong story short, i was telling her that i liked her. In that moment, everything was so intimate. Turned out she has a boyfriend. However, when i was telling her, She was smiling and even she suggested that we should talk again anytime soon, but she said that i should take the lead this time. \n\nBefore we parted after that talk, she asked me if she could hug me (she never hugged any other classmates) and i said yes. But few days later, she sent me a message \u201cDont text me, don\u2019t talk to me. I know we\u2019ll be in the same class but don\u2019t show up wherever i am outside of class. I have blocked your number\u201d\n\nI was so confused, i did not get the chance to thank her or say that i was sorry if i said or did anything wrong. She hugged me and avoided me in every way possible. \n\nWhat could be her reasons?",

I\u2019ve been trying to think the same way, but some of her behavior still throws me off. For example, after that day, she got noticeably quieter in class, started wearing a hat (which she never did before), and kept looking down all the time\u2014it all seemed unusual to me.\n\nBut honestly, I try not to dwell on those things too much. What sticks with me is when I told her I liked her, she validated it by saying, \u201cYes, we had a connection.\u201d When I asked if she ever realized I liked her, she admitted, \u201cYes, I noticed, especially when you did those little things for me.\u201d I even told her, \"I don't mean any disrespect to your partner or your relationship. It's just that if the situation were different, where we were both available, I would definitely chase you like crazy.\" She responded, \"I know,\" with such an empathetic tone and expression that it stuck with me.\n\nThat\u2019s where the questions start running around in my head: Did she ever like me, even just for a moment? Would she have been open to exploring things if the situation were different? Those thoughts keep me awake at night. I\u2019m not trying to sound whiny, but I\u2019ve been in therapy for four months now, trying to work through it, and I\u2019m still not entirely over it.\n\nPardon me for unloading this much information to you.

We had no contact and I tried to move on after we broke up but the feeling did still persist if I overthought about her or if she was talked about around me. Eventually we started talking to each other again and I do still like her but the feeling is still here and it makes everything difficult. Whenever we go on dates it\u2019s hard for me to eat together or just have casual conversations. I\u2019ve found that if I drink ice cold water I can temporarily feel better but constantly drinking water is not only annoying but not fun to do when I\u2019m trying to have fun. Recently I saw a post that mentioned her crush and while it wasn\u2019t specific the post lead to me thinking about her and everything that\u2019s happened and I felt like I was gonna be sick. My heart rate increased quickly and it was high, my stomach started to churn and my mouth started to do that weird salivating thing when you feel like you\u2019re gonna lose your lunch. My friends think it\u2019s just nerves but in that case how do I stop and it wasn\u2019t a factor before we dated and not during the whole time we dated and I was very nervous especially then. I\u2019ve also noticed the feeling is getting worse. I\u2019m honestly at a loss. If I need to be more specific I can if it\u2019ll help but can anyone help? ",

The date went great and we really clicked. I think if we had gone on more dates we would actually start dating. \nThis time the problem is now he studies and works in another country. So it was just 2 days before he would go back. He told me i should come to the country he lives in but i dont see it happening in near future.\nNow that we have a distance between each other, i feel like the connection is dying.\nWe occasionally hit up each other but don\u2019t have a deeper communication. \n\nSo my question is: does lack of communication and pursuing mean he doesn\u2019t take it on a deeper level or because of the distance this is not going anywhere?\nShould i try to keep the contact or leave it to him?",

        "text": "M21, attending college.\n\nI always hear people say that if you aren't happy with yourself, then you won't be happier in a relationship, but when I look back on my relationship that I had 10 months ago, I know I was happier.\n\nI was dating a woman from Germany, it was a long-distance relationship, and when I made the effort to travel and see her (we met up in Cuba), she broke it off. She refused to say why, but when I questioned again and again her (maybe I shouldn't have) she basically said that I wasn't independent enough. She was 27, and is employed, so I realize now that our age difference may have been too much.\n\nShe always wanted to speak to me, and I (having depression) would oftentimes take awhile to speak back. This caused a lot of problems in our relationship, and she was often upset that I wouldn't reciprocate her love. But even despite all the problems, and all the fighting, I still miss being in a relationship, because I really loved being so close to somebody. I really loved being silly and flirting and having someone listen to me play the piano, I just really love romance, I guess.\n\nI haven't been able to connect to any of the women at my university, and I probably won't find anybody there. I'm not worried about that, because I don't really share a lot of their values. (Atheist, vegan, fairly liberal, at a Catholic conservative university). On top of that I don't like the idea of combining academia and relationships, but I'm worried about two things...\n\nFirst, I worry that I'll ever find a woman who loves me for being me. Sometimes I wonder if my girlfriend really loved me, because she ended our relationship abruptly. I wonder now... as judgmental as this might sound (I'm sorry, I have not spoken to a lot of women.) if all women prefer men who are assertive and independent, and that maybe they secretly all want to be dominated in a relationship.\n\nSecondly, I worry that I'm not a good person. I switch between blaming myself and blaming the circumstances and blaming her for leading me on. I'm worried that I'm awful and not worthy of love, I think back to all the times I hurt her by being careless, and I honestly hate myself that I ever made her cry. I got her sick with a cold when I met her, and then I pointed something out to her on a street, and she fell and cut her knee, and I accidently pulled her hair so often... But worse than that I worry that I'm a narcissist, or a psychopath, or a manipulator. I'm worried that I have toxic tendencies that can't be resolved, when we first broke up, I felt so much jealousy and pain over losing her. I kept thinking of her telling me that she would be happier with someone else, and that I had failed.\n\nDuring our relationship, I told her a few times that she was my purpose, because she told me I needed a purpose (but one that wasn't her) but it never felt right to say that. I realized a day ago that she was never my purpose, because I never needed a purpose, but she was the source of a lot of my joy at the time. Is it toxic to find such a large portion of your joy in life in your partner? I honestly don't know, and I'm asking so that I can become better.\n\nI'm so afraid that I'm unfixable. I already question whether or not I should have children because I don't want to pass on my depression to them, and now I'm afraid that it's better if I'm alone for the rest of my life.",

What is more unusual is that he has girl friends who like to hang out with a drunk guy and exchange sexy pics. Well...this sounds unusual to me anyway. I am going to assume that your husband is either attractive or is splashing money around- the girls might be more receptive if they are getting all their drinks etc paid for.\n\nIf she is that receptive that she is sending stuff back, she is not trying to keep him in the friend zone, it  seems likely that at least when he is intoxicated, he would jump on either of those girls given the chance. It is probably true he would at other times too but being drunk makes him less inhibited. Although this might seem like despicable behaviour, it isn't really wierd. It is more that it is unacceptable.\n\nIt is totally out of line, and he would no doubt have a melt down if you were sending videos to other guys.  A chat about it being totally out of line, and you won't tolerate it might be best. And if he doesn't understand what \"not tolerate\" means,  you might need to make it clear, but try to avoid threatening to take divorce and never see the kids type of argument, because you want him to stop, not to make him hate you. \n\nThe \"oh I was drunk\", thing is an attempt to brush it off because he was caught, and accepting that just means he can do whatever he wants when he is drunk. He knows it is out of line. He knows that kind of behaviour could easily end a relationship if it weren't for the kids. I wouldn't let him brush it off.",

        "text": "My partner and have been married a little over a year, we just had our 6 year anniversary a couple months ago, & been friends for almost 9, and I just found out today that he was lying about being loyal back in 2021. For some context, 5 months after moving in together, I received a message on Instagram from \"userxxxxx\" saying that my husband, bf at the time, was cheating on me. She said that he had messaged her on FetLife, and they had been talking for the last two weeks. When she ask if he had a girlfriend he told her he didn't. I asked her if they had sex an she said no, he was planing on it though and she did give him oral twice. She sent me screenshots from iMessage and Snapchat, and sent his contact card for proof. \nWhen I got home from work I asked him if he had been cheating and he looked surprised by the question. I showed him the messages with the anonymous girl. He said he wasn't cheating, he went through his phone to show me he wasn't. There was nothing to show that he was cheating, and when we went to his email and there was a fetlife account activation, he swore it wasn't his. He started saying that his account had been hacked, and would explain how the person messaging me had pictures of him that were saved in the cloud and Snapchat memories since his email and password was the same for his accounts. He checked the back up email and it wasn't one of his or mine and one he said he didn't recognize. He was worried it was an abusive ex that is notorious for making new profiles and adding him, and because he blocks them every time, he said she was coming after me to get his attention. We chatted with a friend that has worked in government and Internet security and he said it was very likely that the account had been hacked, and that we'd be surprised how many people this happens to. With my husbands information being public on business cards, and how easy it is to take iMessages and change names on Snapchat, I believed him. \nOver the years despite choosing to believe him, it never fully sat right in my gut but I chalked that up to insecurities from the previous abuse I had experienced with my 2 ex's; there were some other situations that I caught him in minor lies which he did fess up to when I brought them up before we got married. However, this particular situation has never left my mind and I still question it to this day. The girl that messaged me had given me her first name and I had started to do some digging. I potentially had found her on Snapchat months ago, I didn't even remember adding her, but today she added me back and she asked if we knew each other. I told her that I was hoping to find a Instagram connection I had made a few years ago, but seemed I had the wrong people and apologized for bothering them. Her response was is your husband \"leo\"? I responded with yes and she said I had the right person and it was her that messaged me in 2021...\nI'm not really sure what to do at this point. I'm not really one to talk about these kind of issues with family or friends, so I don't feel like I have anyone to tell. I don't know if I even want to go through a separation and divorce. Our relationship has significantly shifted since then, and he's not the same person, and acts very differently than he did then. I don't get horrible gut feelings that things are off like I did back then, but idk if that's just because I have been dealing with health issues this last year and our focus has been on getting my body healed and healthy again. I guess I'm just looking for advice, from both sides on leaving or staying. \ud83d\ude14",

For all our similarities, one of the biggest issues with my and my girlfriend's relationship is that I feel she has a passive attitude towards life and also dislikes challenges. Even moving would be too hard for her. On the other hand I am a stubborn and ambitious SOB that pursues his dreams of changing the world, finding a way around problems and ignoring the naysayers. I would move across the world if that moved me closer to my goals (and in fact I've done so a few times), and in fact I would feel incomplete without conquering new grounds. This obviously creates a mismatch and could be a deal breaker later on.\n\nWhere am I going with this? In relationships we all learn what we want and don't want. I try to give my girlfriend the same things I would want her to give to me (like supporting her in her goals) and also giving her what she has told me she wants (which I shall keep private).\n\nHowever, for all my efforts, I am sure I have blind spots and I have character flaws that are frustrating to anyone, or \u2013 even though she says I'm exactly the way she wants \u2013 she has needs and wants that I haven't learned to detect.\n\nSo there you have it, not allowing me to pursue my dreams would be a deal breaker, but what are other common deal breakers that people have and that I (or anyone else) could work on? I'm thinking of things like not taking care of physical health, but surely there are a myriad of other possibilities.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR;** : Seeking advice on common deal breakers and areas for personal growth to ensure one can be the best partner possible and maintain a healthy and fulfilling relationship.",

Still my heart flutters when the mere thought of kissing him comes up. \n\nI am the type of person who shows affection over physical touch. But even if I would initiate cuddling he would say 'we act like we are dating'. Which wouldn't be bad. It just feels like he doesn't like it. \n\nI am a general insecure person. And I know how his past relationship went. And how he suffered. So of course I don't want to ruin anything or push him into anything. He is kinda my safe place too. And I feel like I am his.\n\nMy head is just so confused. And right now he is even staying with me temporary. \nI think the worse part for me is to stay calm, especially when we talk about doing things together that are considered couple things.\nWe even watched a romantic comedy drama together.\n\nI don't really know what I am asking for here.\nMaybe some advice or how others dealt with things similar to that.\n\nEdit: so things took a weird but amazing turn. I just let everything go on and just tried to enjoy the time we have together, while he was here. And it turns out, that I wasn't the only one thinking about it. But he did some kind of Hollywood move and texted me while I was on my way home. We talked about it and I asked him out on a date. He agreed so yea.\nSome sort of Happy End for now haha",

This led to me just forgetting about feelings for her. As far as I know she is done talking to that guy. Sense that point we have hung out a lot over the holidays and I seemed to get my feelings back for her.\n\nFor context I have had a couple girlfriends in the past and I've never been good with hints on flirty intentions and with her it's kind of impossible to ever see. When hanging out she has shown physical touch before but I could never tell if it was a platonic thing or a flirty thing.\n\nIf I could get any help with either past experiences or just some advice that be nice",

I really appreciate the considerations that they gave me. Suddenly , i realised that i had been on a crush with a girl in the class. For myself i would not call myself super good looking but kind of decent and not so rich myself. For her , i think that she might have a boyfriend and the chances are super high . I know  that it seems selfish but i dont want to fail also forgot to note that both of us do not hate eachother or smt and we are kind of good friends. Any tips?",

        "text": "So I want to share my experience because I feel very confused.Please do not judge me about how I handle the situation but I really want advice from someone.\nA little context in me and the person: I am a girl in high school how has known this boy since elementary school.I am not really a very emotional attached person and doesn't fall for people easily (higher apathy then most people) so am good at faking my reactions and pretending to be normal.So I really don't care about people I just have to fake it to make it and have a pass time at school.I try to be \nnutral with people.The boy is in the same year, a friend but not as close as in movies we only hang out at school and occasionally text.We live in a very religious country that girls shouldn't really talk to boys.\nNow the confession: It was very subtle I did not realize it at first but the first sign or only sign I got that he might like me was in the summer he texted me like every day.\" Back from summer break I was walking to my next class when he came to me because he promised me a keychain ( we are not in the same class this year) he gave me the keychain, thanked him and before I left he said he likes me.Then I said ok and when to my class thinking it was an odd thing to say.When the first break hit I when to the library ( place I unsualy go) and meet one of my friends how is a girl.We are sitting on our phones ( one of the only places to use phones) and suddenly the boy comes and says the same phrase again and then again and then it clicked in my mind.My friend sitting next to me started getting awkward then the bell rang.I toll the boy we will discuss this later in the next break and he agreed.So in the 2 hours before the next break I started searching on the topic.Then the break came and we meet at the library again.So I told him to follow me to some secretive place not that secretive but not really anyone goes there in break ( no many secretive spots in school).then he confesse.My eyes could not face him when I started asking him questions.I asked why he like me and said because I was the only girl how was ever nice to him, I am pretty and other cheesy romance stuff( I can not remember what he said because my mind was blank).I rejected him in the most \"do not tell him that he only likes you because he admires you\".I did not say that but It was a mix I do not feel the same and mostly try to keep it friendly.He says he new I would reject him.We have a small chat with me thinking I was the end.Oh boy I was wrong.\nNow the confession I only told the girl the library how did not give much thought and a girl in my class how I talked more about the confession how is a hopeless romantic and believes in the goodness of humanity.\nSo 3 months go by, we do not really talk anymore and our tension has gotten high and he became a some what ruder especially at the front of his friend ( in the same class as me occasionally talk).This friend and him started working out ( had mentioned it to me in the vacation that they will start working out) he was not that over weigh but now he changed him and his friend ( in good way and am proud of them)but he started to kind of boste his new changed body at me ( did not think much of it again). Then in December I started helping at the library on breaktime when he comes to me.We start talking and he tells me how do you think I look and I say great and tells me that he might want to because to fast when he is older.I say good luck but then he ads when am older I will take you out.My mind goes blank and do not remember what I tell him.The Bell rings.Weeks later winter vacation hits ( that is when am writing).\nSo now I am really asking for help.My friend in my class say maybe I should have said yes but I do not like him like that and I do not want to use him like some experiment.please tell me what should I do?How do I get out of this situation?\n",

        "post-author": "Traditional_Movie786",
        "text": "There's a lot in here, just be prepared\n\nThank you in advance for any advice! :)\n\nWe've been more or less together for around 8 months now, officially for 5. (long distance the whole time)\n\nShe has a lot of mental conditions, but the most important one for the moment is one from where she has to split everyone into multiple versions of themselves, the good version and the bad version. (I have it too, but not as badly.) She loves and adores the \"good\" version of me, I have so many good memories of it and she's exactly what I've been trying to find when we have those times. But then there's my \"bad\" version. When her perception of me switches to this version, she does not hold back. She's told me I should be euthanized in order to leave the resources I waste to people who are worth having alive, that she doesn't love me anymore, that I don't deserve to have anyone and that I should spend my life suffering alone.\n\nObviously, that's probably warranted if I was only the sum of all my flaws and negative traits. But I'm not, and whenever she says things like that, she's saying it to the entirety of me.\n\nAfter just yelling those things at me for a few minutes, she tells me, in the same tone and among saying she hates me and that I should commit suicide, that she needs me and that I have to be strong to pull her out of her spiral.\n\nBut that's about the most difficult thing you can do when you have the person you're most vulnerable to, the person you love, the person who knows all your darkest fears, screaming at you that she wishes that you would just \n\nI've managed it more or less every time, but every time this happens I sustain a lot of emotional damage. The person I want to be would be able to just discount the things she's saying, but it's so out of the blue and unexpected that I have no chance to prepare. \n\nShe has a lot of other difficulties as well, she cannottt handle heat at all mentally (it's summer where she is right now, in the high 30's and mid 40's Celsius). As in, can't remember what she said 5 seconds ago. As in, she wants to be a good person but she can't remember what being a good person means, or if what she's doing doesn't line up. As in, she can't remember what 5+7 is. We think it's because the heat expands the blood vessels in her body, lowering her blood pressure and taking away oxygen to her brain. \n\nShe had a few hours recently where it got cool again and returned to the person I remember her to be, the person I fell in love with. The person who loves me.\n\nShe has no one else to help her. I truly love her, I'm trying to be here for her but it's costing me dearly every day. But I know that leaving means she will have no one left who can help. I don't want to leave her, I know the sweet and loving person she really is, but I can't survive this onslaught for much longer.\n\nShe has manipulative traits too, traits that just up and vanish whenever it gets cool again.\n\nShe said she doesn't get back with exes, period, so if I left now I'd probably never get another chance. I know I have to take care of myself, but I care about her too and I would be supremely happy with her if I could keep her cool all the time. I think she would see my leaving as a betrayal as well, because I'm really the only one who can help her in these situations.\n\nShe has very high standards for me, ones that obviously she can't hold up on her end at the moment. She blames me for everything. The worst thing I've done to her is to be depressed when she needed me. She seems to think that it's a choice I make, so she blames me for it. She says the only way she can forgive me is to spend $3kUSD on her. (I know it sounds very manipulative. Here's what her reasoning was to me: She needs me to invest in her in order to see that I'm serious enough to have earned her forgiveness.) She also says I'm not loving enough, that I don't know how to love. But she contradicts herself regularly about it. She has her times when she thinks I'm the worst person alive, but then with my  \"good\" version she consistently tells me that I'm everything she needs, that she wants to spend her life with me, and that I'm the most loving, most perfect man she could ask for. She has a lot of contradictions like that and it's so confusing, and she expects me to be able to always pick the right answer (even though the answer changes).\n\nLastly, I'm also going through a very hard time in life and need her support, which there is very little of. I have heavily emotionally abusive parents who have made becoming an adult a living nightmare. She keeps telling me I can ask her for help and tell her about my feelings, but whenever I do she gets stressed and either tells me to stop and just deal with it myself, or she falls into another spiral.\n\nI'm struggling and suffering and there's another 3 months of summer still left. I don't know what the right decision is. I could say that we need a break for a bit, but that will still be somewhat of a betrayal and she might refuse entirely. Even if she doesn't, it'll leave her without support for however long I need to recover.\n\nIf it adds any helpful context, I'm on the autistic spectrum.\n\nwhat.... do I do...",

Today I started looking into how romantic feelings feel like and if aromantic people can be in relationships. The issue I'm having is that I feel similar for someone I know and don't want to say anything about it. I've done this thing before, get jealous of their closer friends and looking for them in spaces I know they will be, but idk if that's just me wanting to be closer friends since this isn't unusual for me and it's faded before? Or if I should explore it more.",

        "text": "**Hello!**  \nI just opened Reddit today to write this. I really need advice from people on the outside because I'm clueless about what to do and, honestly, I'm scared. I'm a 23-year-old Brazilian girl, and I have the biggest crush on my friend from college. I have feelings for her that I\u2019ve never had for anyone, not even for people with whom I\u2019ve been romantically involved in the past.\n\nWe\u2019ve been friends for about three years now, and our friendship has grown since the day we met. Actually, when we first met, she was dating someone, but they broke up about two years ago. That\u2019s when I started having feelings for her. Since I never felt like it was reciprocal, I never acted on those feelings and just continued being a friend, which included talking about our romantic affairs.\n\nThe thing is, every time I see her with someone, I always have this feeling of *\u201cI would do everything to make her happy, so much more than they do.\u201d* It\u2019s kinda hurtful. (Don\u2019t get me wrong here\u2014I always support her. I want to see her happy with whoever she chooses.) On the other hand, when I\u2019m with someone else, I feel bad because I\u2019m not with her. I can\u2019t develop feelings for other people because of her\u2026 This situation is consuming me, and in the end, I think I\u2019m just too scared to let her know about this\u2014for fear of losing our friendship, of losing *her*.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve noticed that she\u2019s been wanting more physical contact with me lately, like hugging me more, biting, etc. We\u2019ve started doing a lot of things together, things that are bringing us even closer. For example, this sunday, we baked a cake at my house together and played games on the PS while cuddled on the couch (another friend was here too). All of this, and yet she talks about her exes at the same time\u2014it\u2019s like a lot of mixed signals.\n\nThis is really summarized but what would you do in my position?\n\n**P.S.** I might delete this later; I don\u2019t want this to get out.",

        "text": "So, everything started at the start of the year when (during a drinking game) i (F18) asked a friend (M18) about a rumour that he had liked me when we were little and never gotten the chance to ask. Well, he answered that he had liked me from kindergarten until like fourth or fifth grade.  In the same game I was asked who would I kiss in that group, and I thought about him but really shortly and said someone else.\n\nDuring the year, our friends started to tease us about our supposed crush on each other, but in the middle school way, that you pick two people and decide that they are the new match in a joking way. Over time, i kind of started to think more and more about this pairing. At first, I found it quite practical, if it were to happen. We both were inexperienced (hadn't even had our first kiss), he is quite funny and interesting, and he had previously liked me.  At some point I started to think about it seriously and even developed a sort of crush.\n\nI started to try getting closer, but not too much because I don't know how and I'm really scared and insecure about it, especially considering my lack of experience. And this way I kept on, I tried to go to every party, talk to him more... But it wasn't really that notorious, I think.\n\nIn September, on break, my friends, i and a bunch of more people went for a week to a beach city in my county, known for the parties that time of year. I was a bit more determined this time. I tried talking with him more, responded to his ig stories, tried to be close at the parties. Got quite drunk, mainly for the parties, but also hoping I would get the courage to do something. The closer I got was a hug and a lot of conversations.\n\nAfter that, I continued silently trying. Going to every party, trying to work up the courage to do something, trying to message, etc.  But then \"disaster\" struck, he asked a friend of mine (lets call her G) to go with him to senior prom, but I was sure she didn't like him, because she told me. A few days later, I remembered that I had already agreed to go with another friend of both of us, so it maybe didn't mean anything. \n\nI continued the same. He, on the other hand, invited G to do things with him, messaged her, all of that. But they were just friend, she definitely wasn't interested. \n\nLet's call the crush S.\n\nAt prom, I had kind of lost all hope of anything happening between me and my friend, but didn't care much. I had a lot of fun, danced with my friends, drank a bit (the drinks were kind of mild tho) for most of the party. At one moment I decided that I hadn't gone outside and that I needed to do a round. So I went outside, I went to talk to a group of my friends, including this one. I sat down next to S, and we talked in the group, we were all quite drunk. At some point, the others left us. I asked him for his camera (he has a little digital camera that I always try to \"steal\" from him because I like taking pictures with it), he took a picture of us, and then I asked him again and I took I picture of him, because I thought \"he probably doesn't have many pictures of him because he takes the pictures\". Then he asked to take a photo of me, then he asked me if I would kiss him, just for the epic picture, I thought about it and was like f it. We kissed for the picture, then we didn't kiss For the picture.  It was both of our first kisses. We made out for quite a wile, in between we would talk about, how he liked me when we were kids, why he did, it being our first kiss, learning together, figuring this out tomorrow, he even mentioned like a future together and all... \n\nWhen we stopped, I realized that I had accidentally dropped a full glass on my dress, that my dress (strapless) was falling a little, that I really needed to use the restroom and that our over friends were coming very excitedly towards us, so I got up quite quickly and left to the restroom. I danced a while more, tried to dry my dress, and continued to party like normal. A lot of congratulations because a lot of people saw us. On the way back, he texted me that we \"were like the kardashians\" (I swear I was funny). I responded something.\n\nThe next day I waited for a text or something, but nothing. Two days later, I decided it was technically the tomorrow he talked about, because it all happened in the very early morning. I checked the text, I realized I had made a typo, so I corrected it. He finally responded. We talked a little bit more through the days but nothing meaningful, I think I always start it tho.\n\nThis was a week ago, and i've only seen him friday in a birthday party, but we didn't spend much time together an what we did we didn't talk about it or do anything.\n\nHere is where i ask for advice. I don't know what to do about this. What does this mean? What shall i do? Is he interested in me? Let's all remember that he is very awkward and unexpirienced too. But i don't know.",

At first I kinda shrugged off the odd things she would do or say around me since they weren't blatantly directed at me. After a while I started actually noticing that it was odd so I started talking to  C about the interactions since I'd found it odd.\n\nI have known D for a long time and as far as I understand from what she has said she doesn't view me as anything more than a friend, and you would think that would be the final answer.  But like when it's just me and D or Me, D, and C hanging out within the past year or so D has been doing things that are a bit more explicit around me that isn't within her character even from what C says.\n\nLike C even says D would never twerk or anything like that in front of a guy she doesn't have any interest in, if a guy walked in on her changing she'd usually hit them even if they didn't see anything, etc... Within the past year or so she's been doing these kinds of things around me without it being directed at me but also when I'm in the room with her. When I had first mentioned it to C she thought I was just imagining it and being paranoid (not quite sure if that's the word i'd use) but then she started actually watching how D acted around me more and how D would talk around me, C started noticing it too and agreed that it was strange and out of character for D. Even things that D will talk about around me/with me are things that you'd expect her to talk to close female friends or a bf about instead of me.\n\nNow, C and I are starting to notice that the guys that D date are very similar to my personality or have many of my likes/dislikes with very slight differences. C and I both agree that what she says and how she acts around me (especially now) don't match up, C and I are wondering if we are going crazy or if this could be some sort of unintentional \"hey i have an interest in you\" kind of thing.\n\nPS: I'll try to answer any questions to help others better understand so they can understand better and come to a more solid conclusion. I am tired so I may be forgetting stuff but I will help others come to a conclusion as well.",

I blocked her from my phone, I deleted the photos I had of her, and she tried not to talk to me, but I always came back to her, I don't understand why, she has something special that resonates with me. My obsession with her is such that I tried to go out with other girls to see if I could forget her, but no, I always ended up licking her feet, sometimes she spoke badly about me, and other times she became very affectionate, we were like that for a whole while. year, until A few weeks ago, she discovered that I was trying to be with a girl and got so jealous that she broke my phone and posted a photo of her on my WhatsApp status. After that, she told me that she considered me her boyfriend. But she didn't like my womanizing attitudes, that's where I stopped going out with all the girls I went out with and, arming myself, I left the gym one day and confessed my love for her, I told her that I had always liked her, that I loved her. , that I would give everything for her, she told me yes and no, that is, she told me that we had to go out more because of what was happening, after that, I tried to talk. with her in the chat, but I'm terrible at trying to \"hook up\" and it didn't help me either, her messages were very dry, I constantly told her to see us, to which she avoided me, just this afternoon I told her for the last time that see each other, and she replied that she had already had enough of that, that it was very annoying to say \u201cwhen will we see each other\u201d all the time? And we didn't see each other because she was super busy, man, that was terrible for me, I deleted her chat, I tried to block her, but something told me no, I'm sorry, I screwed up, man. The woman with whom I so much want to be in a relationship, the one who gave me signs that she also wanted to be with me, had told me that, since I am very impatient, now I can't get her out of my head anymore, man, I need advice from people with more experience that I, what should I respond to that message? Should I keep trying with her? How do I apologize? Is there a possibility to save what is ours? Any answer I will be grateful to receive. ",

By talking disparagingly about you behind your back, she's made herself and her lack of respect for you perfectly clear.  I understand obsession with a girl too, but to be around the people she's clownin you to ... how can you do that?  That's the uncrossable line, man.  They see you comin and they're rollin their eyes and snickerin to themselves.  Don't subject yourself to that.  Even if you don't believe it, you deserve better than that.  \n\nI know it's hard.  At 52 I'm still not 100% but one thing is clear; where there is disrespect there is no love.  You've got to have your dignity bud.  If you don't respect yourself enough to walk away and stay away, you'll never have girl's respect either.  You just can't respect a doormat.  \n\nTLDR; there's nothing to save.  She's been playin you.  People who want to spend time with you **make** time without you having to beg for it.  Believe, just like the popular girls in high school, she ain't worth it.",

I\u2019m saying this because my friends say he is 100% crushing on me too because i\u2019m pretty to anyone who sees me. Given our roles at work, if this does not work out, one of us will have to leave.  But I want to know if he is crushing on me, too. How do I find out?",

He has been one of my closest friends ever. My best friend, C, says that J likes me back but i'm not sure. I always thought he was being friendly. I can't deny that we are quite close, we do ride the same bus and we kinda act like siblings. Both me and J are artists and I figured out through his brother that a picture I drew for him is literally framed on his wall. I don't know how to feel, I do like him but he is kinda giving me mixed feeling when I see him. I can't tell if he feels the same.\n\nThere is so much going on, should I listen to C? I don't want to ruin our friendship with this. Any advice?\n\nps. I am not very good looking, pretty ugly.",

I am a college student and will be going home for Christmas break which is a month and a half long and i absolutely need to tell my parents before then. \nFor some prior information\n- When I mean parents I usually am referring to my mom. She is a quite hot headed individual who tends to become very upset at the slightest inconvenience or unusual subject. She has pretty dramatic mood swings and when she is not on control, no one is able to talk. Also is not able to have an adult conversation to save her life. While my dad is very laid back and go with the flow, this is a subject I\u2019ve never brought up.\n-I\u2019m 19 in college studying for medical school\n- I live with my parents when I\u2019m not at school\n- I\u2019ve never been in a committed relationship. Haven\u2019t ever discussed any sort of attraction towards men with my parents. Nor have never brought anyone home for them to meet. Have had relations in the past but they never knew about them\n-my mom has specifically mentioned how glad she is I\u2019m not in a relationship in the past month\nBack to the story\n     I feel pretty good about this relationship which is why it is crucial that I tell them, I just don\u2019t know how. The holidays are coming up and I\u2019d like to see him around those times. My parents have trackers on my phone so it\u2019s not like I can go and then lie about where I was. He is really wanting to not have to wait to see me for a month and some time but if it came down to it would absolutely wait if I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to. I\u2019m just very nervous to let her know because I\u2019m not too sure how she\u2019d react. My brother M(24) recently had introduced his girlfriend F(21) to my family and my mom is not a fan of her and lets her know it. He held off as long as he could because he knew she would be upset. While his and I\u2019s age gap is around the same as theirs, since I\u2019m the younger one I fear they\u2019ll be upset about that. Additionally, he didn\u2019t go to college (which is very important to my parents) but is instead involved with the trades. Now what\u2019s funny is my mother\u2019s career is centered around promoting the trades for high school students but when it comes to her own children, she would not want us to be with someone like that.  He\u2019s so precious, has his own home, supports himself, works a great job and welds on the side. He\u2019s seems perfect but I don\u2019t know how to surpass my parents expectations.

We hadn't talked much since but this year and last year, they had come over to visit us (she asked to book tickets to meet me) and we had met again last Christmas, refueling our friendship and we were closer than ever. We messaged each other every day and had countless conversations about many things. Over time, some of those conversations ended up being about how she liked somebody and i always tended to help her out. This year, she visited me again and we had a really fun time (she also has a twin-non-identical sister) and we all had tonnes of fun. When she stayed at my house, things got a bit messy and i haven't gotten myself to clean it cuz it reminds me of her and she has gone back to get city and we won't meet for another year. Everytime i look at it and i try to clean it, i can't get myself to do it and it makes me feel uneasy in a weird sort of way. Now i also find myself thinking about her more often and i cant seem to shake the feeling that i love her. We shared a few brief moments of being intimate about feelings but she has always told me that i was never her type and it probably won't work out but i never really questioned it cuz i didn't want it to work out until now. I need to get over this as it is really affecting me mentally as i can't stop thinking about her. Any thoughts?",

But then somehow I spiraled into thinking that I won't pursue anything because he is not my usual type physically. He is not necessarily unattractive but I keep wrestling with the physical things that are different from my usual type because I don't want to pursue something with him if I don't find him attractive because that seems wildly unfair.

Somehow the person found completely mesmerized by the other and found that this is different from all that they feel before ,, found that they falling apart so confronts that something is happening between us feels a but unease and tell about the stomach butterfly and wrote a letter about how to love someone without saying.\n\nIs now dating the person they've talking about and wanted to build last strong connection. After a while ,, feels that their conversations with their partner (who was previously their friend) have become boring and routine and they are concerned about seeming clingy. They use to have daily chats call asking about others day and sometimes initiates \"puppy fights\" to keep things interesting but later on they've taken a pause from the relationship or cute shit. Not having a daily 24x7 conversations,, doesn't mean that they don't love each other but it's natural to feel boredom in life\n\nSomewhere in the back of their head uncertainty about feelings, whether it's real love or just attachment. They are also confused about their own feelings and are considering whether to continue the cute shit or let go have not communicated for few days and considering whether text her or give her space in dealing with this.After all that shitty shit of confusion, misunderstanding ,miscommunication and doesn't having a open ended conversation by all this chaos \n\nIs in a long distance relationship\n(Dramatic crying or piano in bgm)\n\nBelieve that the feelings they have for their current partner may indicate that she is their first love as they have never felt this way before. Feels like they accept their partner with her impfections,, but their experience of love does not resemble the roller-coaster,  adrenaline rush fueled emotions illustrated in movies or poetry\n\nPrefer not to say \"saranghae\" immediately as they feel it may show desperation,, so they say \"i like youaa\" instead.

        "text": "Hello,everyone need help, this is a 2 part question 1 is advice on winning the intrest of another f25 while being in a 10 year relationship with f26. So long story short I've been in a 10 year relationship that seems to have gotten stagnant, my actions prior to this story have been to enjoy the night life and flirt outside of my relationship but never did I catch feeling or physically cheat on my current partner. However during my thirs semester in nursing school wh8ch me and my current GGlf attend together.I met a f25 who is not prettier then my current gf f26 but has a great personality, the Clinical group is small consisting of 2 males me and another guy and 4 females, in first few weeks I shared alot about my life and they jokely chastised me on not being married yet after 10 years the female whom I have a crush on was the worst offender. She spoke everything that crossed her mind and made jokes about everything so I paid it no mind. However as the weeks progressed I found myself being more and more attracted to her. \n\nSo I text her independently, suggested a movie or 2 and the conversation was light with little content she even called me texting robotic and kinda boring. So I said whateever she juat a classmate. However during a clinical day on campus I introduced my current GF to the class matw and she acted strange like surprised and shy, so I paid it no mind. Well the same week I ran into the classmate again and ignored her cause I was contemplating life, so I reported to class. During lecture break I was confiding on another classmate from the same clinical group who is extremely close to the f25 who I have a crush on. While telling her that I was developing a crush on said f25 she walked up so I acted strange and we went our separate ways. I texted her that same day saying how she was fake for not saying hi in class, and she never responded.\n I took that as a sign to not text anymore. So now currently been 2 weeks after that where we had 1 clinical day together where she ignored me and kept for away, and 1 lecture where I ignored her and did my own thing. It's clear that one the class mate I confided on told my crush how I felt and 2 I made have crossed a barrier by my texting. Cause I later found out that she had a bf who she had been with for 5 year. \n\nNow my thing is one the 10 year relationship of mine will end eventually I know it, I just want to keep a good standing relationship with the 25f who I have a crush on in case in the future timing is good and I can ask her out. I don't see this as replacing anyone just me giving  out the details. So how do I got about reestablishing a good standing with the 25f I met.  ",

        "text": "So shes at this pub trivia i go to every week. Every so often were st the bar ordering at the same time. When I first saw her I thought she was kinda cute. So i did the typical flirty stuff always telling her how pretty she is. Eventually this evolved into slightly more detailed conversations but i always snuck it in. I asked for her number she said she \"doesn't give it out \" I bought her a drink once she seemed to appreciate it but when i tried it again she i don't want to say got defensive but it was odd kept insisting its really nice of me to offer but i didn't have to even the bartender was having my back he kept saying \"he wants to\" When i stopped trying our conversations went back to normal. This sounds like a cliche but she's just as nice as she is beautiful around here is where this started to evolve into a full on crush. We started talking about movies coming out and stuff so i started saying stuff like \"we should see it together \" (one time she asked \"how do you know im not married? In a tone i could obviously tell was a joke so i chuckled and then tobe absolutely sure i replied in the same tone \"you aren't are you ?\" Where she quickly assumed me she wasn't) and stuff like that she smiled but that was about it. Around this point i decided i need to go in for the kill i need to know if she likes me. So she asked me \"how are you \" and I turned on the flirty voice \"trying to figure out if this cute girl likes me or not\" at this point doing pretty much all but wearing a t-shirt with \"I LIKE YOU [HER NAME]\" written on it! And she's like \"do you talk to other girls?\" I brushed it off and just so shed see me do it i did talk to one other girl for a bit...long story short she's cute and she did endulge me for a while but shes not....her.....a couple conversations later i could tell nothing would likely happen even if i was more into it and i was fine with that cause again she's cute but...shes not HER....so me and OG girl had a couple more conversations and she even asked me about the other girl at ine point \"is she nice?\" I saw no point in lying she IS nice and i said so. She started asking me about other places i go and asked stuff like \"do you have a job where you meet women \" im on disability but that's hardly the point. So at this point i start to fear i may be in the friendzone....but i don't wanna be a dick about it....shes a nice person....so i have a couple conversations where i go OUT OF MY WAY not to hit on her and those go well. A couple more rounds of this and shes still ALWAYS saying hi to me even when i don't say it first (which just happens i don't ignore her or anything) and even saying \"nice to see\" me all the weeks we've both been at this pub trivia SHE HAS NEVER walked in with a guy the other guys she plays with arr clearly just friends most bring their OWN gfs theres one I've never seen with a girl but hes a bit older she has never mentioned other guys in our conversations other than that one time she teased me if that even counts i feel like im going around in circles at this point does she like me?

We click really well and I feel like I might be falling in love with him. I just feel like there\u2019s something missing. I don\u2019t know exactly what it is but a big concern I have that might be the issue I\u2019m trying to name is his scent. I\u2019m not attracted to it in the same way that he is attracted to mine. He is hygienic so that\u2019s not a problem. He sweats a lot and the scent he leaves behind is a bit sour. He says the excessive sweat is a side effect of a medication he is taking so part of me thinks tha could contribute to what he smells like but that medicine is essential to his health. Whenever we\u2019re cuddling it isn\u2019t nearly as bad but there\u2019s still something off about it. I know that natural scents are an indicator of relationship status/feelings/compatibility between a couple because pheromones and all that. I\u2019ve been in love one other time and I loved the way they smelled. All my other relationships I couldn\u2019t really smell anything at all or they insisted on wearing perfumes or colognes so I never really got to know what they actually smelled like. \n\nI\u2019ve had this conversation with him as well and he is also at a loss. I want to be with him. He makes me feel safe and secure and seen. What does this mean? Will it take time for me to become adjusted and/or attracted to his scent? Or am I just plain thinking too much?\n\nTLDR\nIn a relationship with someone I\u2019m falling for but I don\u2019t like his natural scent despite the fact that he is hygienic and he also likes my scent.

A few days after I sent a risky text asking to risk it all together, which led to an argument and me getting blocked.\n\nI crossed his path another month later, and he listened to my friend and I telling how great of a traditional dance fest we had the week prior.  \nAnother week went by, got invited to see his concert by my friend. At the end of the gig he took me on the side and ranted of how anwful I am for being there, telling me that he was hurt and jaleous of me speaking of another man, the man being a dancer from the fest, nothing more, then blackmailed me.\n\nI spent the summer away from all this, and saw him again, acting like I didn't event exist. This went on for almost a month, and I ended up at another of his concert, he, again, ruined my night by being angry at me for being here (context, he plays a type of music we don't have much in our area, aka my fav type of music.)\n\nAnd now, I learnt by my mother who had texts exchange with him on a fight with ME, that He loves me very dear to this day but got away from the relationship because I was unemployed and he feared paying for everything.\n\nSo reddit, will he ever comes back ? Or did I ruined everything in the last months with the angry text, and my appareances to his gigs ? How do I save at least our friendship (even tho I love him very dear and wanted my future by his side) ?",

We got to know each other in a very strange way, but we ended up talking. We quickly became very close, and we were on the same wavelength from the start. Well... for a few years, we talked every day, and when I say every day, there were no exceptions.\n\nAfter I graduated high school, we started talking less often, but we still kept in touch. I always felt the need to reach out to him. This cooling off, if I can call it that, happened because I entered into a relationship that lasted quite a while.\n\nThe thing is, I\u2019ve had feelings for this guy since I met him, but I never had the courage to tell him. I\u2019m convinced he felt something for me too; I could discuss absolutely anything with him, but nothing ever materialized between us.\n\nIt just happens that I\u2019ve been single for a few months now. I recently thought about him, and we started talking again. I still have feelings for him.\n\nI should mention that he is a bit distant; he\u2019s different from other guys and has a unique perspective on life in general. He was quite reserved when it came to his relationships, and I didn\u2019t press him with questions. I tend to believe that he hasn\u2019t had anything serious with any girl; he\u2019s a more complicated person. He has opened up to me over time, and I\u2019ve managed to understand why he is the way he is. But I know he wants something serious.\n\n",

        "text": "I recently started talking to this boy. He first followed me on Instagram, then TikTok, and after that, Snapchat. He added me to his close friends and liked a lot of my TikToks. Of course, I did the same in return. About a week ago, he replied to my Instagram note, and we started talking.\n\nI have horrible taste in boys, but he is the most beautiful boy I have ever seen in my entire life. He\u2019s gorgeous. We\u2019ve been talking a lot about many different things, and he seems really smart. Besides his looks, I love his personality and the fact that he\u2019s motivated, wants a future, and has big plans. Unfortunately, he\u2019s the only guy I\u2019ve ever met who has such initiative and determination, and I absolutely adore that.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the problem. A girl I know found out that I\u2019m talking to him (he\u2019s her ex), and she told me a lot of things about him, like how he cheated on her. She said she cheated back, and eventually, they broke up, but this was like two years ago. The way she was talking made me feel like she still has feelings for him. She\u2019s not really someone I trust, but I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s lying. She\u2019s a very beautiful girl but not the nicest person, especially when it comes to behavior.\n\nSo, of course, after hearing that, I asked him about it. His response was, \u201cMaybe I was the one cheated on, not the one who cheated.\u201d He also said he understands my concern but asked me to give him time and get to know him before believing what others say.\n\nThat\u2019s where my trust issues come in. He\u2019s being so nice and patient with me. He tells me when he\u2019s home, when he\u2019s going out, basically everything. He keeps me informed about what he\u2019s doing, and I don\u2019t even do that as much. But what I don\u2019t understand is why he hasn\u2019t asked me out on a date yet or even to hang out. We live only about 8 miles apart, and my high school is in his city, so I\u2019m there every day during the week and on weekends too. He\u2019s mentioned a few times that he\u2019s not rushing things, but most boys I\u2019ve talked to ask to meet up right away. I don\u2019t know if he truly likes me or not.\n\nAgain, he\u2019s extremely attractive and I\u2019m sure a lot of girls turn their heads when they see him. And I\u2019m sure he knows that. Everyone has their flaws, but I can\u2019t seem to find his. I\u2019m being realistic and expecting anything, but it feels like there\u2019s no way he\u2019s so perfect. I don\u2019t know what to do because I might fall for his words and personality soon.\n\nI\u2019ll be in his city again this weekend with some friends. Maybe he\u2019ll ask to spend time with me\u2026 maybe. I\u2019ve asked him a few times, both seriously and jokingly, if girls approach him a lot, and he says he\u2019s not the type to seek attention or care if girls are looking at him.\n\nAnd i forgot to mention, he even calls me \"love\".\ud83e\udd79\n\nI need advice from someone with more experience\u2014someone who can help me understand why he\u2019s acting like this. Thank you so much! \u2764\ufe0f",

In the end I didn't have guts to ask her out. And years later I found out she liked me also. That just my experience. Of course I don't know what that guy looks like, but it might be similar. As one of the options, if you manage, you can ask his homies, they definitely will know",

I explained to him that it wasn\u2019t like that (it really wasn\u2019t), and I wished him good night. The next day, I woke up around 12pm and saw that he had read my messages, so I checked Snapchat and saw that he was active, and the same on TikTok. Around 2 PM, I messaged him and asked, 'Is that it?' He didn\u2019t respond, so I told him to be a man and at least say if he doesn\u2019t want to talk anymore. He said he was busy, so I replied 'okay,' and to my 'be a man' message, he said, 'Do you think it\u2019s hard for me to tell you?' So I said, 'Well, tell me then,' and his response was that he wants to take a break. I was speechless; I couldn\u2019t believe it because everything seemed fine.\n\nInitially, I wanted to be indifferent and accept his decision, but I asked him if he was upset or if he just didn\u2019t want to talk anymore, to which he replied, 'Don\u2019t you already have a boyfriend?' I was shocked again (of course, I don\u2019t have a boyfriend). I asked for more details, and he said that someone told him that I do, and that I met with that guy a week or two ago. I COULDN\u2019T BELIEVE IT. HOW? He said he didn\u2019t believe me and kept insisting, saying he\u2019s been in situations before where girls gave him hope but were still thinking about their exes. I explained and asked him to understand that what he heard isn\u2019t true, that I\u2019ve also heard shit about him, but I chose not to believe it. Nothing worked. I appreciate, though, that he kept messaging a bit longer and didn\u2019t just leave me on read or delivered, which is the only thing that makes me believe he might be telling the truth.\n\nNow it gets even more dramatic. I messaged one of his friends (I\u2019ll call him F), whom I had known for a while (he used to date my bestie, and after they broke up, he asked me to convince her to give him another chance, so he kind of owed me), and I asked him what had been said about me and by whom. He told me that C does this and makes up lies to get rid of me. So I asked F to find out if that\u2019s the reason or if there\u2019s something else, and apparently, it\u2019s exactly as he said\u2014that C just wants to get rid of me. I messaged C and told him to be a man and just say directly that he doesn\u2019t want to talk anymore, that it wouldn\u2019t bother me if he doesn\u2019t want me anymore. He said that\u2019s not the case, and if I believe F, I might as well believe in ghosts (meaning that F is lying). I don\u2019t understand anything anymore, and I can\u2019t move on from this for now. I really don\u2019t know what to believe. i just hope, by all means, that things will calm down and he will reach out to me, or at least that we will meet on Friday (it\u2019s the freshman prom at my high school and he might come too), and I\u2019ll have the chance to talk to him.",

I have a friend who did that all the time but I am not sure. I think it's about how much do you believe in F. If F is trustworthy, then C is very toxic and I believe you should stay away from him. But even that's not certain. I and every friend I have, would never snitch ( it's not appropriate word but I can't think anything else right now ) on a friend like F did. From what you said I think it's best if you keep your distance, but there isn't enough information to assume much. I just suggest to clarify things and don't get too close with him.

As I mentioned, last night was the freshman ball at our high school. At first, we were told that students from other schools wouldn\u2019t be able to get in, but once I got there, I saw C on stage, next to the DJ, helping him out. I went closer to the front and turned my back to him. I\u2019m sure he saw me because whenever I turned around, he was looking at me, then quickly turned away. Well, if I tried to catch his gaze, he wouldn\u2019t even look in my direction. He\u2019s playing it so arrogantly, and I don\u2019t like it. I kept walking back and forth in front of the stage because I needed to help a friend, and, of course, every time I passed by, I didn\u2019t look at C, but my heart was racing. As long as he keeps acting like the arrogant boy, I\u2019m not going to pine for him\u2014or at least I won\u2019t show it. But he is just so arrogant. He knows he\u2019s really good-looking and charming, and he loves being the center of attention, taking without giving. At one point, we both ended up outside at the same time, and two of his friends, F and another one, A, came over and stood with us for a bit, but C didn\u2019t join. That\u2019s how arrogant he is. And my friends kept telling me that every now and then, when I had my back turned, he was looking at me. So, as I said, it was a tough night for me. Seeing him, especially seeing him as he really is, just made me want him even more\u2026 I like his personality so much. He was dancing, having fun, not caring about anything in the world; all I wanted was to be next to him, for us both to dance and have fun. I feel like, in some ways, we\u2019re so similar in personality, and that just makes me fall harder. This guy really drives me crazy\u2026 And another thing: before I arrived at the place, he posted a picture of himself to close friends. I posted a TikTok to close friends, too, and I didn\u2019t look at his story until he looked at mine. He didn\u2019t like my story, and I didn\u2019t like his. But why does he still have me on close friends? Did he want me to see it, to get my attention and make me give in? I really wanted to give in. I had even had a cocktail, and I was missing him so much; I really wanted to like his story, but I told myself to be patient, that time will work things out. That\u2019s pretty much it for last night\u2026 Today, for the first time since we stopped talking, he liked a TikTok that I reposted, and I immediately smiled when I saw his name in my notifications. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s next, but during this fall break, I know I\u2019ll be coming to his town most evenings, and maybe I\u2019ll see him, maybe he\u2019ll see me too.",

F definitely looks way too shady to be honest. I think he definitely followed you outside, because he saw two of you together. And C is master manipulator, or he generally likes you. I can't tell there isn't enough information. Keeping you in close friends looks like double sided: on the one hand he might really want your attention, on the other hand it was part of push and pull tactics. It's very underhanded tactics, and it's basically giving attention to somebody, then striving from it, then giving it back and so forth, and it basically makes other fall for one harder and harder. This situation might be that also. As for me I am not able to hide behind bushes and just say what I fell, but I don't think that's good idea, or even if it was you would have done it. Just considering what I said, okay? And gather more information (not like in spying manner, but more like rumors and stuff). And good luck. Hope it works out.

My friend, let's call him Zed, and I have been friends since freshmen year of highschool. But in the beginning of Junior year, we got a lot closer due to our friend group falling apart. I honestly started liking him last October, but I really didn't want to admit it until January of this year when I accepted it. I haven't said anything to him because he's one of my best friends and I don't want anything to become weird between us. But to get to the main point of this post, I think he might like me back. But I also could be looking into things because I'm an overthinker.\n\n So here are some things that he does on a daily basis: he constantly plays with my jewelry (I wear like ten bracelets and he's always playing with them or touching my wrist underneath them), I've noticed he plays with my hair when I'm not looking because there was a time when I turned around and he looked embarrassed that I caught him, whenever we sit together our shoulders are always touching (even if there's enough space to not do that), he plays with my nails and \"trys to take off my nail polish\" (but he kind of rubs my fingers not like pick at them), I sometimes catch him starting at me, he always leans on me and puts his head on my shoulder, and the last thing he does regularly is walk into me (like when we next together he's always running into me). I've also noticed that he does not do any of these things with the rest of my friends. \n\nBut besides all the regular stuff I've also had some weird specific moments. I'm gonna try to put these chronologically so again, I'm sorry. In March Zed and I went on a school trip and we had some kinda weird moments. First, he kept falling asleep on me and we would share headphones together. But honestly he could've been just tired. Something I can't really explain though was what happened on this ghost tour we went on. For context, it was this really big bus and sometimes it would go pitch black for \"scare factor\". One of the times it went dark, he started caressing my hand and trying to hold it. And then he got super close to my face and I was like \"omg he might kiss me\" but the lights went on and he pulled away (womp womp). The tour guide even commented on it and he was like \"oooo we got a couple\" and Zed and I were both like \"oh we're not dating hahaha lol!\". I don't know. i don't think just friends do that. Unless I'm wrong \n\nLike I said earlier, I'm kind of info dumping. This has kinda been occupying a lot of my brain space so I kinda just needed somewhere to vent. Besides all of the previous stuff I've said, there's more. So a couple of months ago I accidentally revealed to him that I have a crush on a guy, except I wouldn't tell him who it was. Ever since then he's constantly been asking me who it is. I've given subtle hints that it's him, like saying my type in guys is literally him but not saying it directly. That sounds confusing but what I mean is like saying \"oh my type in guys is tall with glasses\" (he's tall with glasses). I can't tell if he's playing dumb on purpose or if he genuinely doesn't know. \n\nOk here's my last blurb, I promise. Please please please PLEASE tell me if Zed maybe likes me. I've written a letter I might give to him before we leave for college but it would be nice to date a bit before leaving. Thank you to whoever read this and I hope you have a good rest of your day! \n\ntoodles! ",

Also, not trying to criticize you, but it would be better to talk to him instead of hinting things like \"my type is guys like you\", because if he does like you, that probably makes him very unsure about your feelings, leading to more unpleasant feelings than if you just awkwardly have a conversation about it. And even if he doesn't like you back, if you communicate about it, at least you'll stop hopelessly hinting at him, which would probably make him feel better and would in the end also be better for you (again, I'm sorry if this sounds mean, can't put feelings in text well).\n\nGood luck.",

So C and I are in our second year of uni and so far, we\u2019ve been in the same exact classes in every semester. I was never really close to C during our first year, I was super sad about my ex so I didn\u2019t really talk to anyone but by the time it was second sem, we had gotten pretty used to being in each other\u2019s spaces. We\u2019d casually talk, he momentarily tried setting me up with one of our mutual friends who I knew had a crush on me but I was never interested in so that kind of fizzled out. Fast forward after the summer, we are now in our first semester of second year and again, we find each other in each other\u2019s space. I\u2019d always thought that C was cute, so I would somewhat make the effort to talk to him but nothing too serious HOWEVER, this sem I found us talking basically everyday. He\u2019d text me when he was bored in class, we\u2019d text each other outside of class and played games together. My friends were so convinced he liked me back so like an IDIOT I asked about a month into the semester (about a week ago) if he only saw me as just a friend and he said yes. Honestly, a part of me wasn\u2019t surprised given my romantic history\u2026 but my friends thought it was super odd that he had gotten so attached to me but seemed to only like me as a friend but anyways! the confusion comes from the fact that I find myself even closer to him after that conversation happened. He\u2019s really touchy with me, always asks me to sit next to him and questions me when I don\u2019t. Insists on coming to the gym with me next week just to goof around and asked me why I didn\u2019t go to a recent outing he went to when he never even invited me. I\u2019m so fucking confused TT. I also showed him my Hinge profile today and as he swiped through the guys he\u2019d jokingly say \u201coh shit he looks like he could beat me up, no.\u201d or \u201cI think I could beat him up, date this guy.\u201d Is this normal??? please send help I thought he just wanted to be friends I\u2019m so lost \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d SOS",

We were previously in an open relationship. But 2-3 months ago, he came to me and said he wanted us to go back to being monogamous. So I deleted my apps, and was told he did the same. I was asked to check a message on his phone, when I saw a conversation that had the notifications set to mute. I got a very weird feeling about that. I waited til he went to sleep and opened the convo. He was getting nudes from his ex. I got too angry to have will power and checked the rest of his phone. He's talking to at least 4 different women. (Also, I'm a man. My boyfriend is bi). He's asleep next to me right now and I'm trying so hard not to cry. I have to be out of my apartment in March, we were supposed to be moving in together.

I know the question is strange, but I don't have the courage to ask my friends for advice on the subject, so I'll try here.\n\nI met a boy a few years ago, I only started to be interested in him after he started flirting with me, that's when I realized he was handsome, friendly and liked by everyone, I ended up being very in love, I dreamed a lot about him. him during the night, I was nervous when he was around, I wanted to build a future with him, the big problem is that it didn't work out, we have very different political views and social issues, I also ended up discovering some things about him that left me DISAPPOINTED And SAD (I'm not detailing it so as not to expose it), I suffered a lot when we moved away.\n\nI haven't had contact with him for over 4 years and I've never seen him in person again, the BIG PROBLEM is that it seems like my brain can't forget, every now and then I catch myself thinking about him, remembering him, imagining what it could have been like if he had a different personality/values, because of these thoughts I sometimes take a look at his social media to see if he is ok (like a secret admirer), before I tried to go to some places he liked but I never found him (I never did again that).\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way?

        "post-author": "Ok-Economics-3411",
        "text": "This is a long one, sorry guys:\n\nI (20F) have known and been rooming with her (19F) for about two years now. I had heard so many horror stories coming into college about roommate situations that were awful, and had been told to avoid rooming with a friend because it always ends poorly. I and (I am going to call her Abby for the sake of the post) hit it off immediately, though. I transferred to this college with my high school best friend (Ella for the sake of the post) and we both had some recent trauma with a friend group, so I was scared to get close to new people. Even so, Abby made her way into my world immediately and I cannot imagine where I would be right now without her. \n\nWe shared one room in a college dorm that had an outside community space. We found comfort in each other from day one. She introduced me to ideas, experiences, and even media that I had never thought of before. She made me more emotionally aware. She made me learn to stand up for and prioritize myself. She made me realize how beautiful the world can be. We would stay up late many nights discussing things that I had never felt comfortable telling anyone before\u2014even Ella. I had never met someone with such similar interests as me that I also genuinely just loved being around so much. She makes me feel seen and heard and cared for like no one else does. It was like we were fated to be in each other\u2019s lives\u2014even if just as friends. \n\nIn our first semester of knowing each other (before I knew my feelings), I got into a toxic relationship with a guy two years older than me. It was one of the worst times of my life. He would force me to do sexual acts with him that I would vocalize discomfort about. Then he would gaslight me into thinking I did consent, which I knew I did not. He would also push me to vape and drink even though that is outside of my personal comfort zone. It was hard because he was so nice to me and made me feel so important--while also not respecting any of my boundaries and wishes. It made it very difficult for us to move on from each other (also because I struggled with self worth). My mental health was at an all time low and when we broke up, he started stalking me. Throughout this entire process--Abby was there for me. I realize now I had been taking her for granted at that time, but she just argues that is what a good support system will do and that she cares about me and would do it again.\n\nOnly 7 months into knowing her (at this point we would be able to tell other people just about everything about each other if they asked), I realized I had feelings for her. I was like \u201coh no, this is bad\u201d because obviously you are not supposed to have feelings for your roommate right? I confided in Ella about this, with literal tears in my eyes, and she agreed that this was bad. Ella gave advice to avoid intimate moments (we would regularly cuddle on our futon), romantic conversations (we would regularly talk about what we see in a partner or just how we imagine our future romantic lives to be\u2014understand that sometimes this would be in a joking kind of way and we were not flirting with each other), and conversations about the future (making jokes about living together, getting a house together, etc). It\u2019s not fair to say any of these things had undertones, because I have conversations like this with all of my friends, as does Abby. I also literally cuddle with Ella, so the physical aspect should not affect me either. I agreed with Ella. I tried. Trust me. I tried to avoid cuddling on the futon as we watched the show she was introducing to me at the time, but she would look at me and be all like \u201cdon\u2019t you wanna watch this with me? Instead of doing homework?\u201d And I fold\u2014as would anyone with a crush be fr. I tried to avoid conversations about the future or potential romanticism, but we eat three meals together every day, we get ready together every night and morning. It\u2019s just not possible because, as college students, the future is always on each of our minds. I\u2019m also just not good at steering the conversation. \n\nOnly a week after I realized my feelings, Abby told Ella and I that she met someone. I was kind of devastated, but I also saw this as a positive thing. I was hurting, and I kind of wanted to cry when she talked about her partner, but I was also so happy that she met someone (her first real relationship) and fell in love. I want it to be noted, I was supportive the entire time\u2014even Abby mentioned how supportive I was being about it (it came up in a conversation where she apologized for not being supportive about my relationship with my ex boyfriend before things got bad and toxic, mainly because she was having a hard time adjusting to me not being as readily available to spend time with her all the time--and she was thanking me for being so understanding and supportive of her relationship when that's not how she reacted). While it took time (too much time if you ask me), I was able to get my feelings to fade over the summer when we both went home. \n\n We decided to live together another year (we made this decision before I realized my feelings for her, but I would honestly want to live with Abby for the rest of my life even just as friends), and we moved in to an apartment this time. Things were good for a while. We were now cooking together, going grocery shopping together, doing homework together, going out to eat/thrift/do events together. Yknow, just the type of domestic stuff that would confuse a 20 year old girl's (my) heart. Anyways, about a month ago Abby and her partner broke up. It was very hard for Abby, and I was genuinely there for her through every step. When she was first considering breaking up, I would give advice on ways to make the relationship better so it might work. I would point out little things Abby would be avoiding saying that needed to be said for a compromise to be possible. Overall, I was doing everything in my power to be neutral while also giving advice. In the end, Abby just realized that this relationship was not for her. She mentioned things that she needed in a partner that she hadn\u2019t even realized she needed before. (Lower commitment, more similar interests, better open communication, being able to prioritze her future, etc) And everything she listed off also fit my ideal of a relationship. I'm a medical student and I've always said I don't have time for a relationship, but Abby and I already spend hours upon hours together everyday---things would not be that different except that I could openly love her.\n\nBasically, my feelings have resurfaced for Abby despite understanding it's not in my best interest, and I have no idea how Abby feels about me. We spent about 6 hours a day together. We still share all of these intimate conversations and moments. Sometimes she\u2019ll say something that will genuinely confuse me, because it's romantic or obviously flirting. It\u2019s difficult for me because I have never found someone that I trust wholeheartedly and could seriously see myself spending my life with. And I see us 20 years from now and can picture us still being significsnt parts of each other's lives. At the same time, that picture could be of two very close friends. I want advice on how to go about our relationship going forward. I just really like her and kind of want to cry but at the same time I don't want to put our friendship in harm's way. \n\nAt the same time, I get thoughts sometime randomly of \"I want to go to a medical school where you will have your career\" or \"I wish I could tell you how much you amaze me, truly\" or even (on my saddest, sappyest, most lovesick days) \"I wish I could marry you\". \n\nBasically, help, I don't know what to do to either a. Get rid of the feelings or b. Distance myself in a way that won't be harmful or c. Go about this in a way that won't ruin the friendship ",

I thought that I had moved on from the traumatic experiences when I was finally able to remove myself from him this summer. We were in an on campus organization together and I went inactive this semester, and I felt much healthier. But he texted me a few weeks ago and I had a panic attack (then blocked him). So yes, he definitely did affect me. I've tried talking about it in therapy (I'm new to therapy and I've had a really hard time connecting to my therapist and am currently looking for a different one) but it has never gone well. \n\nAnd I fully see your point. I realized my feelings after she helped me so much and it could just be me latching on to that. I will say my high school best friend and her roommate (who is also my close friend) were both there for me during this time and I have never felt any romantic interest in either of them. But that doesn't necessarily mean anything. I will definitely explore this point more. \n\nSeparately, I don't think she would have romantic interest in me. This thought is not because of low self work or low self confidence, but genuinely I don't think I'm even her type physically. And emotionally I think we are extremely close and she typically puts a separation between feelings for friends and romantic interests. I'm trying to say, we are so close that I don't think she'd let herself feel that way about me even if I were her type. \n\nSo, I really don't plan on pursuing anything. I just don't know how to permanently get over these feelings. I can't exactly distance myself from her without hurting her. We also carpool together and study together so I think it would just be impossible to distance myself. I will think more on what you said about her being a safe space though because that is such a big point that I haven't thought about.",

        "post-author": "BeanzBeanzBeanzz",
        "text": "Why am I so bad when it comes to talking to women?and why do I get 0 attention from women. \n\nSorry for such a long post but I sort of just need to vent. I\u2019m 21 (M). Go to uni. But have never had a girlfriend. Still a virgin (that\u2019s mainly because I don\u2019t believe in 1 night stands but even then I\u2019m not sexually active at all) And just never get attention from girls. Ideally I\u2019d like people my age to give input but anything is welcome. \n\nLike I\u2019m not going to lie. I think I know the issues to my own question but I just want a bit of input. \n\nSo going way back, and this story sounds silly but i think it may be psychologically relevant. In primary school (I think middle school for US), when I was 11. I had a really big crush on someone in my class. Like i genuinely think that\u2019s the first time i felt love about a girl. We were really good friends and one day I told her I had a crush on her and if she wanted to go to the school disco. She rejected me and went with this other guy and I got teased for like a whole year. I was a pretty soft kid back then but sometimes at home or school I\u2019d cry when seeing them together and it wasn\u2019t because of the teasing it was because of her. Our friendship basically broke off because it was awkward and when I went to secondary school I just never had really any girls that were friends. I talked to them in class etc\u2026 but never messaged them or hung out after school. And it is still like that. I haven\u2019t had a genuine friend that was a girl since then. And I think that sort of did something to me. \n\nI have a very big barrier to people that I don\u2019t know. When I don\u2019t know someone I find it very tough to move from the \u201cgetting to know you\u201d phase to actually being about to goof around with them and sort of be real friends. This is specially apparent when I\u2019m just 1 to 1 with someone. \n\nI also find it tough to make common ground with people if they don\u2019t have my interests. I sort of find it hard to come up with conversations when the other person does not share similar interests with me. This can be harder with women because most of them don\u2019t like sports, video games, sci fi movies etc\u2026 so I just don\u2019t really know what to say to them without asking the normal \u201cgetting to know you\u201d questions (like where you from, what course you do etc\u2026) but not to toot my own horn. I do think I have a nice personality. Especially to the people I love, so i just wish people could see the other side of me that people who actually have known me for a long time have seen. \n\nMaybe the last thing is I just never ever get attention from girls. Like I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever gotten a compliment from a girl other than I have nice eyes or eyebrows and even that never happens. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a Greek god by any means. I\u2019m 5\u20199-10 so just around average height, I am 65kg so I\u2019ve got a slim build, I keep myself clean and I think I dress relatively nice. Maybe a few things is that I\u2019m slim but not very built like my arms are pretty thin and don\u2019t have broad shoulders (but I am going to the gym). Another thing is that I do look pretty young for my age. I can grow a slight beard but I normally keep it as stubble but whenever I tell a stranger my age they also say I look way young like 16,17,18 not 21 which I can see being unattractive but what I am supposed to do?? And the last thing is probably my own insecurity but I don\u2019t like the way my teeth are. I have nice clean white teeth but when I was 16 the dentist told me I don\u2019t need braces. even tho I have a pretty big gap between my top front teeth which I absolutely hate and I get super insecure about. I am saving up to get private treatment but it\u2019s expensive as a 21 year old university stupid. I just want to get a smile I can be happy about and get that part of my confidence up.\n\nI think overall with feeling awkward talking to women plus me not being confident within myself causes some of my issues but as women, from your perspective on my situation could you give advice. \n\nSorry it\u2019s such a long post.

Just remember that with my situation, we are adults in our twenties, so results may vary for my advice going to a teen.\n\nMy advice is to consider if you could still be friends after having that conversation (whatever the result would be), and if you both are mature enough to have that conversation. \n\nWhen I spoke with my best friend, I made sure to leave it sort of open ended for discussion. She told me she had an idea about my feelings, and explained that she didn\u2019t reciprocate those feelings. However, she didn\u2019t want it to ruin our friendship either, and so we stayed friends. Fast forward to now, we\u2019re still close and keep in touch, and I lost those feelings for her after about a month.\n\nI think if you are both mature enough (which no offense, you guys are high schoolers. So really consider if you guys are willing to have an adult conversation like that) you should have that conversation. Just maintain and try to keep it open. Don\u2019t start putting up boundaries and thinking about having distance with one another, or force her to choose between you and her boyfriend. Just get her thoughts and explain that you want to tell her how you feel, but don\u2019t want to ruin the friendship.\n\nObviously, if for some reason you don\u2019t care about the friendship, just go for it. But just be open and be adults about it, and you\u2019ll be fine. And in my opinion, if things don\u2019t go well, you\u2019re 17. That person wasn\u2019t ready to have a mature conversation, and it\u2019s their loss. You don\u2019t want someone like that in your life. Trust me, while I still have my middle school/high school best friend to this day, I also gained a new best friend as an adult (the one I\u2019ve been mentioning) and also just lost a middle school best friend about a month ago because of he\u2019s an asshole. Take from those friend that people are going to come and go in your life. Keep a tight circle with good, mature people, treat them right, and you\u2019ll be fine in life. Those who aren\u2019t willing to be like that never deserved to be in that circle in the first place.\n\nSorry for the long comment, but I hoped this helped. Good luck!",

        "text": "I (female) think I have a crush on one of my friends (male)\n\nFor context, we met a little over a year ago at a mutual friend\u2019s birthday party (His at the time, and now still his best friend). I don\u2019t remember why I was invited. At the time I think I was still a little antisocial around these people. It was one of my (at the time) close friend\u2019s friend group. Basically, they were all her friends. A large group of mainly guys while me and my friend were two of the only 3(I believe) girls present. \n\nBefore we met for the first time in person after having talked a bit online, I thought he was pretty cute. He had really nice hair, fluffy but not a complete mess. His eyes were pretty too, and his smile was adorable to me. Overall, he seemed to be my type in every way.\n\nSoon after we sort of came together in a friend group of four (I\u2019ll use fake initials) : Me, My friend (A), \u201cThe mutual friend\u201d i mentioned before (O), and (B) the friend I thought was cute. It was nice, I think. We\u2019d all hang out sometimes and I got to know B more over time. I don\u2019t think I realized it then, but I was growing more and more fond of him.  In recent months (about 2 months ago), I think I\u2019ve found myself falling for him. After all, he was nice to me and just my type. \n\n\nNow for my issue. I\u2019m 99.9% sure he doesn\u2019t like me back. He\u2019s a nice guy, sweet and respectful. I don\u2019t know if I like him like that or I\u2019m just obsessed. He\u2019s always on my mind when I\u2019m not actively focusing on something, and every time I hear him talk, especially to me, I can\u2019t help but feel some sort of \u2026happiness? (Sorry, bad with words.) I\u2019ve wanted to do so many things with him, give him gifts and express some sort of expression but I\u2019m kind of scared. \n\nI\u2019ve tried doing stuff with him but we never really got around to it I guess. I understand we should probably get to know each other better if I\u2019m ever going to have a chance but part of me thinks he doesn\u2019t like me and not only romantically. Sometimes it feels like he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me, and I could see that. I\u2019m not saying that he doesn\u2019t just see me as a friend, but I feel like even if he was looking for something like that, it wouldn\u2019t be with someone like me. A little upsetting, but truth hurts I think. \n\nI\u2019m finding myself even more insecure because of this for some reason. I hear of all these things he does with other people like playing games and think to myself that we don\u2019t play games with each other that often. Yes, I understand this is jealousy. Yes, I understand he can have friends but it\u2019s not really that he has friends but the fact that they have a relationship with him that I can\u2019t seem to build for some reason. \n\nNow, I\u2019m not really trying to build a \u201crelationship\u201d relationship with him, I just want to be better friends at the moment, and even that could be enough for me. But I can\u2019t even manage to do that. I really need help. \n\nSorry for the long rant, if I left out anything that you think I should add, please tell me, and feel free to ask questions. I just don\u2019t know what to do. The reason I came to reddit was because I\u2019ve heard good things about this place and wanted an opinion from people maybe more experienced, as well as a platform where no one knows me or (i think they can\u2019t) find me.

To give a bit of context she talked to him only one time when she asked for another boy that she liked insta, after that nothing but she says she has been stareing at him in one time to try and figure how he thinks out, for a bit more context she is kind of the perfect girl gets high grades is verry feminine with a good body and face when im kind of the oposite, fat face  kinda tall and I sometime act masculine from what i found out about him, he likes girls that are delicate so i try to watch what i say and how i dress around him. So I have the suspicion that he likes her cuz one he keeps like taping her shoulder pulling the chair shes sitiong on and sometimes even attempts to flirt with her (shes the nly girl ive seen him talk to) and im afraid she accidentaly responds, but i think shes just being friendly cuz thats how she acts around every boy and as I sayd he isnt really her type from what i know and she called him a pig and ugly several times. Now i ask if im just paranoied or he might actualy like her and if he does what can i do to make him like me instead (ive only had like 2-3 conversations with him that went kinda dry)",

We talk on daily basis but the other day something happened and we both confessed to each other and i feel so guilty and don't know what to do.\nMy sister is a very understanding person but l'm scared she would get mad at both of us and he is scared of losing her as his best friend. I'm going to tell her of course but do you think i should tell her about both of us or just about me? Or should I wait at least a couple of months?\nHe thinks that I should only tell her about my feelings and see how she reacts first and then we tell her about the both of us in 2 months, but I think that she should know now about us both. He is just scared that he might lose her cause they are so close, or might lose the both of us.\nSo what do you guys think? What would you do if you were in my shoes?",

You can show interest because you get to leave and aren't available to him unless you choose. This seems like baby steps for you to try dating.

Here\u2019s my life dilemma currently: I (F19) post a lot on my stories and one day this guy (M20)I have never met (lives on other side of world for now, and we know OF each other through a siblings) replies to my story and we start chatting. I didn\u2019t realize he was flirting because I genuinely was just chatting but then then all of a sudden he outright said he thinks i\u2019m cute. He said he\u2019s always seen my stories and thinks i\u2019m super pretty and was complimenting me. He was flirty. Usually I love the chase so having someone straight up tell me their feelings have me butterflies. I later found out he\u2019s a Capricorn and I\u2019m a Gemini. I just don\u2019t know much about capricorn men. Any advice? What are they usually like? Are they usually this upfront? He seemed super genuine because he also said he\u2019s not supposed to be getting distracted right now and had to mute my posts. It does make me sad but i\u2019m just curious about what they\u2019re like!! Like for example he\u2019s posting way more on his stories now even though he\u2019s muted me. Please message me or comment. As a gemini I usually get bored and love the chase but wow this guy is ALWAYS on my mind :))) ",

He is very pretty and kind, I wanted to. He kissed me back.\nI visited again, we were more rambunctious but we never really took any next steps, by now I'd been visiting him throughout 2 years...\nThe next time, we were just the same, Wrestling, being coy, I learned flirting more...\n\nI told him how I loved him, how I wished to be his, and him to be mine. He told me he had no romantic interests whatsoever. None, I asked him why he returned the kiss, why he embraced me so much, he said he wanted me to feel what love was like.\n\nI grew up in an unstable situation, so I suppose I can understand where he got the idea, but now I just, crave that feeling of love again.\n\nwe are still good friends, we converse often and I even intend to stay with him a bit after I seperate, but, I don't want to press him further, he has trouble feeling things in general, you see...\n...It is very difficult, because I am almost haunted by his eyes, his nose, the features of his face, he is truly beautiful, he makes me feel safe, but he is someone I cannot love, despite wanting to, not father than friendship, anyhow...\n\nI guess I ask, how can I move on? Has anyone else had this issue before? And, can you tell me what love is like to you? I know it is an odd question, but, I was told by my therapist there is a chance I just think this is love because I've never felt so safe with someone before... So, yeah... What is love like for you all? How can I move on and perhaps find love elsewhere?",

Di solito \"me la cavo\" ad ingegnarmi per questo tipo di avvenimenti, ma, essendo che saremo in un posto particolare, questa volta vorrei fare qualcosa di diverso oltre alla classica cena. Chiedo a voi nella speranza che qualcuno conosca qualcosa di inusuale da poter fare, grazie per ogni risposta",

        "text": "Hey Reddit, I could really use some help figuring out what to do in this situation because I\u2019m pretty lost.\n\nI\u2019ve been friends with this girl for about 4 years, and the truth is, I\u2019ve been in love with her the whole time. But no matter how close we get, every time it feels like we might take things beyond friendship, she pulls back. It\u2019s really confusing because she\u2019s told me she loves me, thinks I\u2019m attractive, and even said I\u2019m her type.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets frustrating: she\u2019s been in four serious relationships with other guys while we\u2019ve been friends, and they\u2019ve all been these \"bad boy\" types\u2014guys who are manipulative or into drugs. She\u2019s currently dating someone like that again. I\u2019ve asked her why she keeps going for these guys, and she\u2019s admitted that she\u2019s scared of committing to someone she can see a long-term future with. She doesn\u2019t want to get bored or feel trapped in a long relationship. Yet, at the same time, she constantly hints at a future with me, joking about us getting married or having kids one day.\n\nTo make things even more complicated, we spend almost all of our time together, except for at night when she\u2019s with her boyfriend. We cuddle a lot, I give her massages, and she always wants to see my body or comes to me for validation and support. It honestly feels like I\u2019m her boyfriend in every way except the physical part.\n\nOur friends, her friends, and even her family think we should be together, and I\u2019ve had plenty of chances to ask her out or make a move, but I always hesitate because I don\u2019t want to ruin what we have. I also know I\u2019ve struggled with confidence, and that\u2019s held me back from going for it.\n\nI\u2019m not here for the usual \u201cjust move on\u201d or \u201cgive up on her\u201d advice. That\u2019s not where I\u2019m at right now. I\u2019d love to hear from someone who\u2019s been through something like this before and made it through to the other side\u2014whether it worked out as a relationship or a healthier, less confusing friendship.\n\nWhy does she keep choosing these guys when she\u2019s told me she\u2019s attracted to me and has feelings? Is there something I\u2019m missing here? How do I handle this without feeling stuck or ruining our friendship?\n\nAny advice from someone who\u2019s been in a similar situation would mean a lot!\n\nTL;DR: In love with my best friend for 4 years. She\u2019s told me she loves me, finds me attractive, and hints at a future together, but she always pulls away and dates \"bad boys.\" We spend almost all our time together, cuddle, and act like a couple without the physical part. I\u2019m not looking for advice to \"move on\" but rather want to hear from people who\u2019ve been through something similar and made it through\u2014whether it led to a relationship or just a clearer friendship.",

Yours isn't too hard to find. Many people grow up seeing adult relationships that are dysfunctional.  It makes them afraid to risk it, so they find a way to control a situation, so it's not the real thing. You are doing exactly what she is doing. You both give your love to people who will fail you. You won't change until you learn what happened to you as a child that made you into an adult who needs love from people who won't give it. It's not too difficult to guess that one is it? The truth is you are her boyfriend, but she uses you for the almost healthy aspects of a relationship and fills in the rest with dysfunctional men. To avoid what she saw growing up. You need to get away from this woman completely, but it's going to take a huge amount of work. Good luck.",

I've alway attributed this to the fact that she is an extrovert and I am an introvert who had been taking too strong of antidepressants for 3 years. She talked to me about the fact that she's felt really not loved, like she's pursuing me and I'm just there for the attention she gives me. I told her that maybe l'd changed if I left the meds, now it's been 5 days since and I snapped at her yesterday because she made a mistake that almost cost me a test, I told her to shut the fk up and she got real mad at me because that's not how we treat each other.\n\nTODAY, it's been 1yr and 6 months since we've started dating and we were supposed to go eating but I didn't contacted her about it bc I am too proud to talk to her after I got mad.\n\nTHE POINT IS: we spoke, I gave her vague 'okay' answers to her\ncomplaints, she started crying and told me that I was not communicating my feelings and it was like talking to a wall and that we should give ourselves some time to lower the uneasiness between us.\n\nWhat should I do to fix this? Take her on a nice date? Write a letter telling her how I feel? Should I cry myself to sleep? Should I go to the psychologist to work on my shjt? Please someone help me figure out how do I fix what I fked up cause I\u2019m seriously losing my mind right now. She\u2019s not just my gf but my best friend, we\u2019ve known each other since 7th grade, she\u2019s so important to me.",

He's also been on antidepressants too.. Sometimes he gets so romatic and then there's nothing again\nAs his partner, it's hard not to feel unloved. I always feel like I'm not enough or I'm such an unlovable person.\nI'm a romantic person who really puts effort to things and spending this much of energy and not gatting any back can be so exhausting.\n\nTRY TO CARE ABOUT HER. \nThe answer is just that simple. You don't need to do something really big & crazy ( cause putting little but consistent efforts and attention is much better than a huge but once in decades affort.)\nTry to listen to her, i mean, REALLY LISTEN to what her heart says. Try to hear her needs. This is the fisrt and most important step\nYou mentioned that you really care about her and she's important to you. Maybe she needs to hears these from you. So try to express your feelings toward her. Tell her how much you care about her and what she means to you. Everyone needs to be reminded that they're loved. Open up to her. \nBut verbal affection is nothing without action.\nSo it you're saying kind words to her but still acting like u don't care, it's not gonna help u.\nTry to spend time with her, show interest in her hobbies and interests and be enthusiastic about it. Let her see that you like hearing her and spending time with her. Try to remember small details about her. Ask her about her day and also tell her about your day ( cause when you don't communicate and talk to her about yourself, she probably feels like you don't care about her and  u don't bother to tell her about your life and feelings and hear hers.)\nInstead of watching movie alone or playing video games, try to spend some quality time with her. You can watch a movie together or cook together. Give her help and support if she needs it. Try to be there for her. Don't let her drown in loneliness.\nPhysical attention is also important. Give her unexpected kissed and hugs. When she's tired or feeling low, give her massages ( scalp massage is the best). Or u can even ask her to let u polish her nails once. It's a really cute a romatic thing to do). \nAnd also, let her do these things for u too, let her feel that you like her presence and you appreciate the effort she puts in your relationship. \nI think love is nothing more than giving care and affection to your person and letting them give that affection and love, too. \nLOVE HER, AND LET HER LOVE YOU.",
