        "text": "My son is 28 years old and he went nowhere in life.  He became an alcoholic who loves drugs.....he can't hold a job because of his drinking,   when he's sober he's an angel.\n\nWhen he drinks he turns into an evil person, last night he fought a random stranger while he was drunk at 11am.  My sons can't even open his eye and he needed stitched. (This is not the first time this has happened)   I got a call that he was in the hospital\n\nHe didn't even wish me happy mother's day today,   he called me asking for food.  I cried on the phone and he told me to grow balls.\n\nHe lives alone, and he's been fired at every job because he's drinking.\n\nHe ONLY has me.   His grandparents from dad's side,  stopped talking to my son when he was 12.   They are rich and they would spoil my son,  once I left his father they blocked us.\n\nHis dad is a drunk \n\nI don't know if it's abandomnet issues, or inherited his dad's alcoholic behavior.   All my family doesn't want anything to doo with my son because of his actions in the past.  \n\nI need advice because I feel like I lost as a mother.  I DID EVERYTHING FOR HIM\n\nHELPP",

I hate to say this but your best path forward is to tell your son not to contact you anymore until he has completed a recovery program and been sober for an extended period of time (at least 6 months).  I\u2019d recommend you look up Al Anon.  It\u2019s hard to find good Al Anon meetings so please be patient and don\u2019t give up.  \n\nYou cannot help your son.  He has to help himself.  If you give him anything, that\u2019s one more dime for him to abuse substances.  Don\u2019t let him stay with you, don\u2019t feed him, anything until he has stable sobriety.\n\nAlso, look up groups on here for dealing with sons/daughters that are addicted.",

It's been my experience that supportive withdrawal from an addict's life can often swifen a rock bottom. Left with few lifelines, sometimes treatment can become the only option left for the addict. \n\nI'm also a mother. So I can imagine how difficult it is. Addicts do recover. But whether or not your son gets clean, I promise THAT WON'T HEAL *YOU*. Addiction affects everyone who loves an addict. \n\nYou deserve peace and happiness, regardless of the choices your sick son makes. We parent as best we can, but at SOME POINT, we must let go, especially if we're enabling bad behavior and possibly preventing recovery. I think you know you are probably beyond that point. \n\nBig hugs, and best wishes! Happy Mother's Day.",

She had to see him skinny, out on the streets and still knew she couldn\u2019t intervene. He had to hit rock bottom to realize he didn\u2019t want to do drugs anymore and once he started to make a change on his own, that\u2019s when she knew it was real and could step back in as a parent. He\u2019s been sober for decades now and even told his mom that if she would have intervened while in the middle of his rock bottom, he probably wouldn\u2019t be alive because she would\u2019ve most likely been an enabler. \n\nI also witnessed this with an uncle, drugs again, and my grandma was his enabler, so I also saw how enabling hinders an addicts growth. My uncle is currently still battling with drugs and relapsing constantly. Unfortunately, his mom, has passed and he can\u2019t depend on her any longer for support. Last I heard, he was in a pretty stable situation but he\u2019s in his 60\u2019s, doesn\u2019t have a decent job, or anything to pass down to his son and I know that eats at him everyday. \n\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t intervene, I\u2019m just saying that sometimes parents think they\u2019re helping, but they\u2019re actually making the situation worst or just not actually being helpful to the healing process. \n\nIf your son\u2019s life is ruining your life and he is an adult, I would stop helping him. I\u2019m not a mother so, easier said than done, right? I can only tell you as someone who witnessed this a few times. I hope your son gets better and I hope you two can be on better terms.",

Yeah, it's going to hurt and it was his decision. \n\nI am in my late 30s, I am a veteran, I got a degree and I am married.  I have never done anything to wrong my mother.

I wish you the best and again Happy Mother's Day! \n\nYou did the best you could!  Don't beat yourself over situations you cannot control!",

        "text": "Well my where the hell do i start? I guess my trauma and mental illness stems a great deal from my mother. She is a toxic, energy sucking vampire who will destroy anyone she deems to be below her..and in her own eyes it's her daughter...me. Growing up I thought I was an angry child. It turns out I'm not I'm very kind and thoughtful..I was just in a family who didn't value or respect me as a person with their own individual wants or needs. Growing up I exhibited normal emotional reactions to things and I was always dismissed and told I'm faking it for attention...I'm manipulative...selfish. all of these words and thoughts stemmed from my narccisitc mother and she instilled them upon my brother and father who both treated me as she treated me. Needless to say I became the black sheep of the family..my brother the golden child who could do no wrong. I never even got into trouble Growing up. I didn't have alot of friends because of my parents so i was doomed to spend my time in our cramped little trailer hearing them fight or they would fight with me. I was always name called from a young age..I was stupid, useless, good for nothing. I could never do anything right in their eyes. I don't know why they hated me so much I never stole..the baddest thing I did as a kid was drink but who didn't. I was just always given a hard time. I dealt with alot of depression and suicide thoughts growing up. I used to cut myself. I remember showing my mother my cuts and she told me i was a lunatic and to never tell anyone or I'm going to a mental hospital. No love or support there....the basis of my life with my parents particularly my mother. No love. So I buried alot of my mental health issues and they festered. I was always so sad and angry living at home being bullied by my parents and limited help. I was a loser growing up I didn't have nice clothes I was over weight..always alone in my house with my crazy parents. Needless to say when I met my first boyfriend at 19 I was over the moon to rush into that relationship and move out. Turns out the hero I thought i was running too ended up physically and mentally abusing me for 4 years. My parents knew about the abuse they seen the bruises and no one protected me. I felt trapped like I couldn't leave the relationship. It was either stay with him and grt abused or go live with my parents and get abused. I wanted neither. Eventually I left my ex and I was able to live on my own with my daughter. But my parents are still involved in my life. They don't help they only shoot off and bring me down. I feel hurt and misunderstood by them that I never got the love and support I needed and deserved growing up or after my abusive relationship. My mother told my ex before she \"knew how I could be\" so she understood...fucked right to say that to a man you know is hitting your daughter. I'm 31 years old I'm tired of letting them have control over my emotions. A part of me still wants a relationship with them but I know it won't happen they are mean and toxic and fail to see their faults. Even now I'm doing better in life I quit drinking and I'm going back to school for nursing and they still are making me out to be a bad person to fit their narrative. It just hurts when your biggest enemy is your parents they are the ones who are supposed to love and support you the most in this life ",

She has physically abused my brother multiple times that I and multiple other people have seen. She chased our neighbor to their front porch because they were parked on the neighbors lawn and they tried to move them from their property. She had gotten a husky mix and left her out in the desert heat during 4th of July for 3 days just so she could go on a cruise ( there was no sitter) the dog had no water or shelter besides a kennel. We had gone there and there was feces and urine everywhere (they did not inform anyone of their dog being left outside for 2 days). They ended up rehoming the dog. This is just the scratch on the surface, I legitimately hate her and I do not know how I can maintain a relationship with my brother.",

She had a really hard time and we helped her but she seemed to think we didn't care about her. We let her know we love her.\n\nShe got better over some months and started working. All was well but she got a boyfriend and changed. Barely spending time at home. Getting more mean complaining about every little thing and things she would enjoy with us she didn't want to anymore. She was never really given a hard time or had us be mean to her.\n\nShe complained she was doing too many chores over the year but over time we did more and she did less until she was only expected to take out the trash and doesn't do that anymore.\n\nJust one example, I spent a couple hours cleaning the garage but next day she started leaving trash and putting stuff and I asked her to clean it and she just gave me a lot of attitude and never cleaned it.\n\nShe also barely spends time at home, I'll be lucky to see her for 30 minutes once a week. Even on my dad's birthday she only came over for 30 minutes and on mother's Day even less time. Spending time with her boyfriend at his house instead.\n\nBut then she says she feels guilty like she is ruining her relationship with her family and cries about it, but we are always there if she needs it. It makes me sad and I miss her.\n\n\nAlso I apologize if this doesn't sound coherent I'm up late and barely awake.",

I've been fiercely independent my whole life, and now in my 50s, I find I've made myself sick from overwork and worry, which were caused by needing to be independent and not failing while on my own. \n\nIt's a lot to be proud of, but can be a double edged sword. \n\nMay I suggest that as you enter your senior year, you should know when graduation is.  Tell your important ppl when it exactly is, and offer to help plan travel and accommodations, perhaps increasing the chances your VIPs will be there.",

I suggest you build a life and if you ever become a parent yourself, visit your kids in college.",

        "text": "TL;DR my mom filled out one of those books with questions about her childhood and life and all that and I read it just now and it was heartwarming and sad too\n\nFor Christmas I got one of those books advertised all over social media for a parent to fill out and answer a ton of questions. She gave it back to me on Mother\u2019s Day today and I read through it and UGHHHHH I wish I could hug her younger self.\n\nMy mom is really unique - very shy, no friends except my dad and me, didn\u2019t go to college and worked at the same place for 34 years - I don\u2019t want to call her boring but can\u2019t think of a better word. She\u2019s happy as she is but sometimes tells me she feels depressed and lonely because my dad let her retire and she has nothing to do all day. Shes very dependent on my dad and when it\u2019s just she and I, I feel a need to look after her like a child (from a place of care and love). \n\nAnyways, I just read the book. She left a lot blank because I don\u2019t think she feels like she has a lot of \u201cworthy\u201d things to add. But what she did fill out was so bittersweet to read. So much about being a mom and loving my dad, and I hate she thinks that\u2019s all she is. She answered a lot about her childhood and that was really nice to read as well. It gave me a different perspective of who she is and why she is that way. \n\nIt was a really good reminder that she was a kid and then a young adult before she was a mom and she experienced so much before I existed. \n\nI do recommend getting these if you want a nice keepsake and something to reflect on every so often. My dad will be giving me his on Father\u2019s Day and expect a much different product lol (in a good way - he\u2019s just different than my mom). I got the books on TT shop but I see them everywhere and they\u2019re pretty inexpensive. ",
