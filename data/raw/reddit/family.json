I went to one of her free recitals last year and it was fine, but I can\u2019t imagine how anyone would ever pay that much money to see a child\u2019s dance recital.  My whole family thinks my wife and I are monsters for not attending.  Just a rant I guess.  Anyone else deal with this kind of pressure from family? ",

If the whole rest of your family thinks this is a reasonable request, try picking up some volunteer work on the weekend in question so that they don't feel so justified in criticizing your lack of availability.",

                "body": "Going off one of your comments, your niece is in competition dance, which is different from a recital. I have 2 daughters in comp dance, so I have a little experience. Competitions will have multiple studios whereas a recital is generally just the one studio. Depending on why you\u2019re going, comps can be more fun to watch as the dancers have more training and so the routines are more in sync and are more entertaining. Although, I love watching the little dancers at recitals too\u2026 that being said, I have never had to pay to get into a competition. I know our studio pays a fee for each competition, which gets passed onto us parents- but that\u2019s included in our monthly bill for our studio. I have never had to buy a ticket to get in the day of. Also, every comp we\u2019ve been to will include a free live link that we\u2019re allowed to give out. I agree, $50/ticket for any children\u2019s event, esp at that age, seems a bit steep. We do have to pay for a ticket for recitals, but at most those are $20/ticket. I will say, it means a lot to my girls any time an aunt/uncle/cousin/grandparent comes to a comp or recital. they understand that people can\u2019t always come, but also appreciate if anyone is able to watch the link. Any chance the link is an option? It does mean your sister will have to tell you what your niece\u2019s routine numbers are and what time they are supposed to be on (they do like to run ahead of schedule!) but this could be an alternative that is considerably cheaper and less time consuming. And could get your family off your back\u2026",

When I was younger I\u2019d call them to usually thank them for something they did or sent me so they initiated it. In my twenties I would call just because I would randomly miss them. They would get all happy and excited. I\u2019d also email my grandpa starting at 12 because he was all excited when e-mails became a thing due to being good at typing because he used to do it via typewriter for the army lol. \n\nMy mom and dad will reach out to my kids with text. My mom will call me and ask me whether or not I think that it bothers them and to make sure to tell them she won\u2019t be mad if they don\u2019t respond because she\u2019s just reaching out so they know she\u2019s thinking about them. They usually respond no issues, sometimes not\u2026.always though when she asks about gifts. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude2d\n\nI talk to my mom usually once a day whether it\u2019s phone calls or short texts the longest was once a couple of weeks when I went into a severe depressive episode. She ended up calling my husband just for proof of life and I felt bad for worrying her so I make it a point to answer or respond if I haven\u2019t reached out and she does. She can always pick up if I don\u2019t have the mental energy for anymore conversation and she\u2019ll just say \u201cI love you I\u2019ll let you go, go snuggle with your husband and rest.\u201d My dad doesn\u2019t reach out to people typically but will randomly do it just to say he was thinking about us and loves us or especially will if he knows we\u2019re going through a struggle, but because I talk to my mom daily it doesn\u2019t feel like we don\u2019t keep in touch because he\u2019ll yell hi or I love you from the background and my mom will fill me in on whatever hes up to.\n\nAnyway, I plan on being the same way with my kids when they are adults and out of the house and same if my kids decide to have kids. I think it\u2019s the responsibility of the parent and grandparent to make their child/grandchild feel loved. Mine have always made me feel like I\u2019m a priceless amazing miracle. It wasn\u2019t like I could do no wrong but I can see looking back that the times they were upset it was because they were terrified for me. Their boundaries and rules all came from love. \n\nThat kind of love makes me want to reach out to them, get their advice, talk about the littlest things. If I didn\u2019t reach out to either my grandparent (sadly all gone except my grandfather on my mothers side now) or parents they wouldn\u2019t mad and complain. They would either get concerned or worried that they did something wrong. My grandparents would have probably just assumed I was busy with life and been happy with the updates from my parents.\n\nSo yeah very long story short I think it\u2019s very weird that they complain, but don\u2019t reach out. It gives a sense of being entitled to your love. It\u2019s backward\u2026.. our offspring is entitled to OUR love, not us theirs, and we can only hope and try with everything we have to do it right so we can earn it back.",

I'm Austrian, our cultures are close enough - esp. in that area.\n\nThe idea of the eye-level parent-child relationship is comparably new and there's just way too many parents who either purposefully or unintentionally missed the memo.\n\nAll I can tell you is that the only way to have a satisfied and content life with things like that in the picture is to set some boundaries and stick to them.",

        "text": "So first off my Dad (45M) was disinvited to my (25F) wedding last year after he harmed my 21 yo sister while at my half-sisters (only say half to differentiate  different moms here) high school graduation dinner. \n\nHe was upset that my youngest sister was not talking to him at her hs graduation dinner because he invited my grandma to her graduation (which she doesn\u2019t like after my grandma called her a liar when saying my grandpa sexually harassed her at xmas) and that I was sitting with my ex-step mom (which recently broke up w him a year prior and was emotionally abusive towards) and  he went up to my 21 yo sister to say goodbye and told her he was pissed the youngest wouldn\u2019t look or talk to him. \n\nWhile he was talking to her he was also wrapping an arm around her in a way to others that would look like he was just hugging/ putting her in a arm lock while talking to her around her neck but it was hurting her with how tighter he was holding her. \n\nShe tried to play it off during it occurring and told him he was too tight around her but it seemed to her like he was so blind with rage and anger that he was just not even listening. She thought at the time he didn\u2019t mean to but tbh idk if it was intentional or not he still hurt her and won\u2019t admit to this day that it happened although people around them saw it but unfortunately did not intervene because they were unsure what they were seeing. I was in the bathroom while this happened and when I came back out I told her immediately I don\u2019t want her near him and he\u2019s not flying with us to my wedding (i live out of our state).\n \nMy 21 yo sister and i share a mom and when we told her what happened she almost called the cops on him (rightfully so) but my sister didn\u2019t want that to happen so I just cut him off and haven\u2019t talk to him since messaging him that i didn\u2019t not want him at my wedding or in our lives especially after he responded that my 21 yo sister was lying about it all.\n\nCut to now a year later and my 21 yo sister is kinda on talking terms with him, so is my half sister but I have cut him out. He wants to catch up and now I hear he has a new gf already and they live together. He also is an alcoholic although he won\u2019t admit it and a major narcissist and previously was abusive to my step mom emotional and then physically with my mom. \n\nPart of me wants nothing to do with him knowing all I know and another part of me feels like I would feel guilty for not giving him a chance. I need some advice sorry that it\u2019s long! \n\n\nTL/DR: Dad was abusive towards sister and won\u2019t take accountability, he was disinvited from my wedding due to it. He now wants to talk but I am unsure if i should let him. He also has an alcohol past, is a narcissist and abused previous women in relationships. ",

I am more than happy to just cut my dad out and carry on with my life as i don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy for us to be around him and he\u2019s obviously capable of harming one of us and then not taking accountability even if he was \u201cunaware\u201d he was harming her.\n\nedit: grandpa did that to sister when she was 16ish so underage as well, i obviously never doubted her so i cut him off and my dad didn\u2019t do anything about it either and still talks to him on and off (they have an abusive relationship too it\u2019s a whole mess)",

        "post-author": "No-Young-3346",
        "text": "**Hi Reddit,**\n\nI'm not sure why I'm writing this\u2014maybe I'm seeking self-validation or support from strangers. Over the years, I\u2019ve constantly asked myself: Were my actions justified? Was I a bad son? Or was my mother simply cruel? I\u2019ve been trying to understand her actions, her motivations, why she behaved the way she did, and why I never felt the warmth of a mother growing up.\n\nAccording to my grandma, they took me in when I was just 7 months old. I stayed with her (on my mother\u2019s side) until I was 7 years old. The reason, as my grandparents explained, was that my mom was struggling to take care of me. She was the youngest of her siblings and perhaps fit the typical mold of the \u201cyoungest child.\u201d\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014I became the \u201cfavorite\u201d of my grandparents, and I grew up a little spoiled. Since all my earliest memories are with them, I have a distant relationship with my biological parents, especially my mom. As a child, I was always talkative. I preferred playing with my girl cousins and displayed what many would call feminine mannerisms. I liked staying at home, watching my grandma sew, cook, and handle household chores.\n\nMy grandma was my rock. She\u2019s the only person I truly considered a mother. We got along so well\u2014we could spend an entire day just being at home together.\n\nMy mom was different. Around the age of 4 or 5, she began showing passive-aggressive behavior toward me. She frequently criticized my actions, often saying I was acting \u201cgay\u201d during almost every interaction we had. Soon, my cousins joined in teasing me. Even some relatives and family friends commented on my behavior, fueling my mom\u2019s aggression.\n\nThis caused tension between my grandma and my mom. My grandma would defend me, saying I was just a child. But things escalated\u2014my mom's passive aggression turned physical. At the time, the concept of child abuse wasn\u2019t widely discussed\u2014it was just called \"discipline.\"\n\nAt a young age, I began to resent my mother. She constantly warned me that gay people go to hell or die alone. That created a deep fear in me. At family gatherings, whenever someone asked if I was gay, my mom would laugh and say, *\u201cI don\u2019t have a gay son. If my son turns out gay, I\u2019ll kill him myself.\u201d* If my grandma tried to intervene, my mom would say, *\u201cI\u2019m his mother. I have the right to discipline him,\u201d* leaving my grandparents powerless.\n\nAt one point, my grandparents even considered adopting me and changing my last name, but my mom refused. By age 6, the tension had peaked. My resentment kept growing until my mom finally forced me to leave my grandparents and move to a different state with her. My world fell apart. She insisted she had a right over me and left my grandparents helpless.\n\nEven though I was now living with my biological family, I felt like a stranger in their house. It wasn\u2019t a home\u2014because, to me, home is where family lives. And my definition of family didn\u2019t include them.\n\nI protested. I cried and walked out, wanting to return to my grandparents, even if I had to walk miles. But these actions were met with beatings. I was hit with a belt for not stopping my tears. She would use whatever she could grab to strike me, especially when I tried to run away. My pleas were dismissed\u2014I was just a spoiled brat, she said. She told me there was no grandma to defend me now and that she would \"discipline\" me.\n\nI was only 7. Everything was new\u2014new family, new city, new school, new life. And I was forced to process all of it alone. I had no friends. I had a younger brother, just a year younger than me, but we didn\u2019t have a close sibling bond.",

This is the first time we are all taking a plane together, as my sisters and I have never been on a plane or been to Florida in our entire lives (I\u2019m 20). \nMy mom, dad, and brother have. \nThis is also our only \u201creal\u201d family vacation; we have gone to Hershey and Great Wolf Lodge in the past for two days, but it was always because my dad\u2019s customers would give us something for free.\n(I'm not complaining, but we haven\u2019t done something like that since I was 10.) \nAnyway, my cousin lives in Florida and is also spending the entire five-day vacation with us. I haven\u2019t seen him in around three years, plus he has always treated me better than my actual brother. \nI have been SUPER excited for this vacation because I will be experiencing a lot of firsts, and I have been begging to do this forever!! I have my uncle/ godfather who lives there, too, and I haven\u2019t seen him in 9 years!! \nI have been preparing for this vacation since April and even have a countdown until we go. I have gone up to my family members and expressed how excited I am to experience this with them and how it\u2019s going to be so fun, but all I get in return is an eye roll or a \u201cyou have said that a million times, it\u2019s not going to be that fun.\u201d Usually, I would roll it off since they are party poopers, but this time, I cried a lot. Idk if I\u2019m dramatic, but I feel like this vacation will create lifelong memories that we will look back on, and I am not the only one who cares. It makes me feel like no one wants to do anything as a family anymore, which makes me feel alone. \nThey have done this in the past when I went on a birthday trip with my friends. It was the first trip I had ever done without family, and for so long (it was 3 days, lol), but my parents kept telling me it was so unnecessary and stupid when I could save money and stay home. But, like, THAT'S NOT THE POINT. I want to create memories when I am young and live life. Maybe that\u2019s the problem. They don\u2019t wanna do shit. \nIdk if I\u2019m crazy dramatic. :/",

        "text": "\nI\u2019ve never had a family member I cared for have any drug use.\n\nMy [29] little brother [22] told me he tried meth and has started now using it this month during work. He confessed it\u2019s been almost every day and not the weekends. I\u2019m not sure if I should tell my mom or my older brother who he works with. He said my older brother doesn\u2019t know, though they do work together my older brother is a supervisor so he\u2019s not always on the same site as him. They work construction. He told me not to say anything and that he\u2019s going to stop, but I don\u2019t know if I should trust him. I\u2019ve been thinking maybe I should text him every day, like, \u201cRemember it\u2019s not worth it,\u201d and keep on him about this, but I don\u2019t really know what else to do at this moment.\n\nHe said he felt comfortable telling me because he wanted someone to know and that he is going to stop and not do it anymore. Seems like he wanted some type of support because he said after really looking at his coworkers he knew it wasn\u2019t worth doing anymore.\n\nI feel like crying, but I can\u2019t because we just got back to his place where he lives with my mom. My mom would wonder why I\u2019m upset if I do. He actually told me while we were on the way back from the store. We normally don\u2019t have one on ones together, with our age difference and different interests, we never really were close close but I do talk to him when I come visit and trauma bond over our mom.\n\nI didn\u2019t yell at him or anything, but I did tell him all the negative things about it, that no matter how he tries to justify it to make himself feel better or try to somehow dumbly convince me trying it for a while isn\u2019t bad, there\u2019s never a positive outcome with that drug. I pointed out how pathetic his coworkers are (some have gambling problems and are terrible dads) and that meth is probably a big part of those issues. That drug doesn\u2019t do anything good, mentally, financially, or otherwise.\n\nI\u2019ve never been in this kind of situation before, but I figured if I got mad or yelled at him right away, he wouldn\u2019t trust me or feel safe telling me things like this again. Still, I\u2019m going to stay on him about it, and honestly, I already threatened to tell someone if he keeps using. I told him it might be best for him to find another job or work with different coworkers. I think if it continues I should also tell his work place this happens.\n\nI told him I want to put faith that he won\u2019t be weak minded anymore and turn it down now, but if he breaks that trust I will tell. He\u2019s never even done weed! Like he went straight for a hard drug and I can\u2019t wrap my head around how he thought it was a good idea?? I never done drugs or drank before, our older brother only drinks! Our tio who we grew up with, but honestly didn\u2019t like cause he was a bad abusive asshole, did drugs and died of an overdose! We\u2019ve always painted drugs as the plague.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m doing the right thing right now with trusting him to stop. I just don\u2019t want him to feel like I don\u2019t believe in him. Should I go straight to telling my older brother? I thought maybe not fully tell him but just be like hey maybe you should keep an eye out on little bro cause he\u2019s mentioned coworkers doing drugs and just talk to him about it.. to maybe like hint to him or talk to him where he\u2019ll confess to my older brother too. I just don\u2019t know, I have no one to talk to about this. ",

Another year living in hell.\n\n\n\nAnd now here\u2019s the shitstorm I\u2019m retaking this year in:\n\nMy mom is cheating on my dad. I found her WhatsApp messages. She\u2019s texting a literal member of parliament. Flirting. Sending hearts and kisses.\n\n> He writes stuff like, \u201cPoor you,\u201d when he tells her how sad she is.\nHe says things like, \u201cI feel hurt when you're hurt,\u201d and she eats it up.\n\n\n\nHe visits her at her clinic. They gossip about his wife \u2014 who (my mom)  also got cheated on. My mom reacts with laughing emojis, fake sympathy, like it\u2019s nothing.\n\n> She went to Mecca with me last year. She cried at the Kaaba. And now she's sleeping with a married man.\nHypocrisy doesn't even begin to describe it.\n\n\nAnd my dad?\nAfter playing the religious Eastern dominant man and enforcing religion up my throat \nI caught him cheating two years ago. Told my mom. Thought it would mean something.\nAnd by the way I caught him and her because I have access to the phone because they argued before about the internet and they broke the god damn router\nHe  has a second phone. Now he\u2019s smarter \u2014 changed the number, the phone, everything.\nBut I know. I\u2019m not stupid.\n\n> And he stole from her (130k) to build a fkn house and also play the role of the dominant provider Eastern man.and  from me (500$). Took our money to hire someone to do black magic on her. Literal sorcery. Literal insanity. And guess what his ass got scammed\n\n\n\nThis is what I live with. Every day.\n\nI used to believe in God. Maybe.\nI thought there was something there. Some justice. Some order.\nBut now?\n\nI think of that line Jesus said on the cross:\n\n> \u201cMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\u201d\nAnd then I think of that System of a Down song, Chop Suey!\n\u201cFather, into your hands I commend my spirit\u2026 Why have you forsaken me?\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd now I say: Whoever You are \u2014 if You are \u2014 I hate You.\n\nWhether it\u2019s Allah, Yahweh, Jesus, the flying spaghetti monster \u2014\n\n> You let this happen.\nYou let a kid grow up in a hell where both his parents betray each other and pretend it\u2019s normal.\nYou watch people suffer, you sit there silent, and then people still worship you? No thanks.\n\n\n\nI even told one of my friends \u2014 a religious girl I used to talk to \u2014\n\n> \u201cWhat kind of God accepts this?\u201d\nShe said \u201callha.\u201d .\nI told her, \u201cYou know I\u2019m gonna curse God.\u201d\nShe told me not to say that.\nI asked her, \u201cWhere\u2019s the justice in this?\u201d\nShe said, \u201cits because you questioned god and hated him and got away from him , You think you can change everything. \u201d\nThen said, \u201cIt\u2019s all written in Lawh al-Mahfuz  (a stone that has every single event that will happen in the universe and its persevered unchangable ) 50,000 years ago.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd then she said du\u2019a (praying )can change it.\n\n> Amazing contradiction. Great logic. You can\u2019t change it \u2014 unless you ask nicely.\n\n\n\nShe means nothing to me now.\nJust another blind follower of a broken system.\n\nI woke up today after sleeping from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. and I hate that because my exams are after 13 days they will be at morning \n\nMade myself oats with pomegranate, apples, sugar. Black tea to stay awake.\n\n> Sat in silence. Thought about how I\u2019m stuck in this place, stuck in this year again, trying to claw my way out with nothing but shredded faith and fake smiles.\n\n\n\nAnd the education system?\n\n> It\u2019s a machine designed to crush you.\nOne year. One exam. One shot. No retakes unless you repeat the whole damn year.\nYou study for months \u2014 and if life gets in the way for one week, too bad.\nAll gone.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, your parents are fighting. Arguing with each other Accusing each other. \n\n\nSo here I am, Reddit:\n\nWhat kind of God lets a child grow up in this mess and calls it a \u201ctest\u201d?\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of faith when your life burns down and all you get is silence?\n\nWhy do people worship a being that lets children suffer and parents destroy each other?\n\nHow do you focus on studying when everything around you is collapsing?\n\nHow do you carry trauma and physics equations in the same fucking brain?\n\n\nThis post was written with the help of ChatGPT because honestly, I can\u2019t think straight anymore. But everything in it is me. Raw. Unfiltered. Real.\n\nI'm just trying to survive. And maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 crawl out of this alive.\n\n",

He is incapable of cooking, cleaning up after himself, taking care of their (4M and 2F) children, or even managing his own finances properly. As much as all of this sucks, what bothers me the most is how it impacts my sister as well as our parents.\n\nTogether they make 6 figures, but he is almost always nearly broke because he blows his money on alcohol, weed, take-out, stuff he wants, etc. My sister has had to give him money for gas several times because he has nothing left in his bank account. All this and he makes more money than my sister does.\n\nI feel terrible for my sister, he has little to no interest in anything to do with things my sister plans for them and their kids, but if something involves his friends or partying he will drop everything to do that. My sister will be home alone with the kids on a Friday night, and then he is in bed hungover all day Saturday so she never gets a break. \n\nHe is so disrespectful and inconsiderate it\u2019s unreal. Not coming to our family dinners because he\u2019s hungover, not showing appreciation for the help my parents give them,   I could go on and on with the stories but it\u2019s endless with the selfishness.\n\nIt impacts my parents because his recklessness puts my sister in stress, and they end up stepping in to benefit their grandkids. She has next to no help from her partner, except for him just giving my sister money every month to help pay the bills. \n\nIt ends up with our parents who are in their 60s/70s babysitting, cleaning their house, having to buy things for them, etc. They do it because they want to for their grandkids, and my sister is a good mom and she tries her best despite the circumstances. \n\nI have no desire to stop my parents from helping out their grandkids, they don\u2019t want to stop anyway, but they are always stressed out because so much of the helping they do is from his behaviour. It wears them down that everyone is being helpful except for him. \n\nHow can I help them be there for their grandkids without it enabling my brother-in-laws selfishness? \n\nTL;DR: my sisters husband is a manchild and my parents are getting worn out helping my sister and their grandkids, but it just enables his behaviour.

        "post-author": "Sorry-Original-1476",
        "text": "Few days ago I posted something and people came all around and scolded me. And let me explain you my complete story.\n\nWe are a family of 5, mom,43, dad,45, myself, 19, brother,17 sister,7. \nMy parents are married for 20 years and during the first decade everyone were happy. However, when I was 9, I was disturbed by fights between my parents. For people who supported my mom, mom was having a brief affair with her colleague back then (2 years). My dad thought this would affect the children and both my brother and myself (sister wasn't born back then) headed to my paternal grandparents house and lived there for a year. \n\nIt was during this time dad became weak, starting hurting himselves and mom didn't bother about that. During this phase is his life, he shared a close bond with our neighbor, 45 now. She is a mother of three, stepbrother, 20, stepsister,18 and my half sister 7. == Ages right now. \n\nStepmom's husband is alcoholic and drug addicted and abused her back then.\nDad and stepmom thus consoled and fell for each other. My dad married my stepmom. My dad handed over a divorce notice to my mom, but she asked for forgiveness and begged my dad. Stepmom, even today, did not divorce her husband due to two reasons:\n1)You cannot find him, Sometimes he comes home often, suddenly disappears and comes after a month.\n2) Stepmom's house she is living in and her father's agricultural field was given to her and it is now with her husband and he has already sold some part of it in exchange with alcohol.\n\nI came back to my house at 10, stepmom was our neighbour and I knew her well before she really took great care of us.\n\nStepmom said she would live in her own house as people might know, she is married to twice and someone would file a complaint. (Indian remote areas, people don't have the habit of registering their marriages).\n\nMom came back to my house( she was with my maternal grandparents)within 2 months of my dad's marriage to stepmom. Dad revealed that he married our neighbor. Mom did not even utter a word but said she want to live with my dad for rest of her life. Dad didn't accept that proposal but I can remember myself and my brother crying when my mom cried and dad thought we children required motherly love. And from then on, even today mom is very obedient and happy with my dad and they are reunited.\n\nStepmom was actually happy as my mom came back. Her opportunity to come back to our home was gone. But still, when dad consulted to her about uniting with mom, she said ok.\nShe helped me alot and supported my dad too. My dad stays with both his wives (3 days there and 3 days here, a week)\n\nDuring the previous post, I said I love my stepmom and everyone would have found the answer. I said stepmom is a better wife for my dad and that's true. \n\nEven today, I would say stepmom is a better human being than all of us. She is equal to my mom. My brother, isn't taking much to both my parents because of their dumb mistakes during the past even today and he also loves my stepmom a lot. She easily attracted my brother and myself and always valued our opinions even in her family related stuffs ( Asked our opinion about our step sister's function when she underwent adolescence). \nShe deserves better\n\n\n",

I don't feel it to be my responsibility as im no longer living there and she's got no reason as to why she can't do it other that \"because she's mom.\" Which has been an increasing reason since my dad moved out and their divorce started in 2023. My uncle (her brother) recently went off on her, im assuming because he's been asked to help with her car too both this time and help with other things in the past. My girlfriend and her mom says it shouldn't be my responsibility to do chores there as im no longer living there. Even after I've explicitly said I don't want to do the lawn she's offered I can look for people to pay to do it. She's always relied on men her whole adult life from what I can tell. And it's always been her brother, dad or my dad and I once I was about 16 to help her with a lot of stuff other than what is general woman things. But the house can't sell unless the grass is taken care of and apparently I'm the only one that can do it according to her. She's not disabled in any way either.

        "text": "I\u2019m a 24-year-old woman living in a beach town with my husband, who is 25. My sister, who is 26, also lives nearby, while our parents reside 1,000 miles away. When they come to visit, it often feels like we have to put our lives on hold to accommodate their plans. They expect us to go out for dinner every night and participate in all the tourist activities, which can be overwhelming, especially since I\u2019ve lived here for five years and have experienced everything multiple times.\n\nRecently, we had to move into a new two-bedroom apartment, and the timeline was quite tight. This affected my mom\u2019s plans to visit, as my husband and I needed to focus on moving, especially given the heat in Florida during May. When I told them I couldn\u2019t join them downtown that night, they reacted strongly, blaming me for not wanting to spend time together. \n\nI\u2019ve always tried to be accommodating in the past, but it feels like they come with the expectation that their vacation plans take precedence over our responsibilities. It\u2019s stressful for my husband and me, especially since they visit about eight times a year. When I do say no, they sometimes misinterpret it as my husband\u2019s influence, which is frustrating because it\u2019s my decision.\n\nI feel like they still see me as someone they can control, and I\u2019m struggling with how to assert my independence as an adult. Am I being unreasonable for wanting to prioritize my own life and responsibilities?",

Recently he's been somewhat interested in my friend 'Pam' (17F). About 3 months ago I had my prom and he made comments after seeing pictures about Pam's dress, saying it was sl*tty as \"her chest was out\" - in front of his girlfriend. I had told him off and said it was weird to comment about a 17 year old's body, but that was mostly the end of it. However, a week ago he added Pam on snap. She told me, and when I asked him about it, he said it was an accident. Anyways, yesterday he was drunk after going out and texted me how he'd learnt new words \"huzz\" and \"chuzz\" etc. He then sent - \"huzz = your friend Pam\", and asked if it was weird to say that. I later found out he thought huzz meant hoe, but I am still shocked at this comment as again, Pam is underage and my brother is 23, with a girlfriend. I am wondering if I am just overthinking it, and he was just joking around, or if it is weird he made those comments. Should I confront him about it, and if I do , should I do it when his girlfriend is there? I also told my dad about the texts and he agreed it was weird. ",

        "post-author": "Brave_Environment580",
        "text": "My dad (James) and my stepmom (Grace) have been together for over 10 years. They have kids together, and up until recently, things seemed mostly stable \u2014 at least from the outside.\n\nOne thing to know about my dad: he\u2019s incredibly calm. Like, Zen monk calm. I\u2019ve never seen him angry, and he\u2019s never dealt with anxiety \u2014 until now. Grace, on the other hand, has always had anxiety and anger issues, but my dad has been patient and understanding with her over the years.\n\nso, last week my dad mentioned that Grace had been constantly talking about a guy from work for about a week \u2014 and then suddenly stopped mentioning him altogether. When my dad casually asked about the guy, she got defensive and refused to talk about it. He also noticed that guy\u2019s name showing up in her messages.\n\nA few days later, he went through her phone (which both me and him know isn\u2019t ideal, but he clearly had a gut feeling), and after that he first confronted her but didn\u2019t say anything about the messages, she denied everything but some days later she went through her phone again and saw that she had erased everything even change the other guys name, so with that info dad confronted her again saying that he want through her phone she ended up admitting that she was cheating. He didn\u2019t yell or freak out. Instead, he calmly asked her if she wanted to leave him, and told her it would be okay if that\u2019s what she wanted. She didn\u2019t give him an answer and that has really bothered my dad, he has been feeling like shit not knowing if she wants to be with him or the other guy.\n\nSince then, they\u2019ve barely spoken. What\u2019s even worse? Grace is now giving him the cold shoulder. She\u2019s angry and has been treating him with attitude, like he\u2019s the one who did something wrong. My dad even said to me, \u201cThis is probably going to end in divorce.\u201d And honestly, I told him that if she\u2019s the one acting mad after she cheated, then she\u2019s not worth holding onto when he tries to fix things and she\u2019s just ignoring him.\n\nSomething else that\u2019s been bothering him is that Grace recently started turning off location sharing on her phone after work or when she goes out to \u201cexercise\u201d \u2014 that only added to his suspicions (she did this after he confronted her) So she keeps flirting and textning with this guy and has even changed password on her phone.\n\nI\u2019m also really worried about my younger siblings (the oldest one is 10 yrs younger than me). One of them is on the spectrum, so this whole situation is going to be especially hard for them to understand and cope with. Since I don\u2019t live with my dad, I\u2019m not always there to support them, which makes it even tougher. I just hope we can keep things as calm and stable as possible for their sake.\n\nAny advice for how I can support my dad right now? He\u2019s really hurting but trying to stay calm for everyone else\u2019s sake.\n",

To be honest when she got with him in the first place. She didnt divorce or separate from him after telling me and my sister she'd do so to show us girls she could do it on her own? He cheated on her for months and somehow through all the arguing she's done with him, begging, fighting, mind games, etc. This is not to say my birth was a mistake but I couldve came later in life. The chances of her career and life being better than it is present is likely. Her nursing career might've taken off and she mightve been financially stable. But no. She chose a man with a child already straight out of high school and had a child by him which completely changed the trajectory of her life and the rest of ours.

It benefits him too because he is very old and is not all there after having multiple strokes. So I'll help by driving him around and other ways.\n\nThe time I've been spending here I've tried to make a connection with my little brother. I would joke around with him and ask him how his day was. He used to be more responsive, but lately he's been having more of an attitude; not just with me, but my parents as well. I'm usually at work for the day so I'm pretty sure I haven't done anything to directly anger him, but when I talk to him he seems annoyed like all he wants to do is isolate and play his roblox game. He's 12 so I try to be understanding of him as a teenager growing up in a household where my step mom and dad will argue all the time. Not physical abuse, but they do yell at eachother. I can understand him picking up some of their habits while I wasn't around, but something he does is beyond what I would've done as a kid. Like call my dad an idiot because he can't find something. \nI heard that one time he even tried to attack my dad over an argument. So he is going to live with his mom for a while. I've checked him when he does these things, but I think deep down he needs emotional healing. Tbh I don't think he even cares about me. I called him to make sure he was okay after his flight and all he had so say was \"okay.\" Like \"I really don't care, idk why you even called\" type vibe. These only so much I can do to reach him, but I think he needs therephy.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you have teenage kids? Is it just a phase? What's the best way to help without being overbearing?",

        "text": "Need some advice, creative ideas, sensitive approaches.\n\nSo my dad (75m) is the favorite parent/in-law of my husband (40m) and me (37f) as the whole family feels comfortable with him and he's a very good grandfather to my two kids (5f and 4m). He lives half the country away, so now that our family seems permanently settled, we've had conversations about him coming to live near us. This would be great, as my daughter has turned out to be high-needs and we are seriously needing some kind of change. My dad wouldn't be doing overnight or intensive care of the kids, but he's been great when he has offered to take care of them for an occasional evening so we can have a date night, or a similar type of childcare. So if he lived nearby, I imagine the kids could run over sometimes after school, maybe he would do an occasional evening of care, etc. Nothing full-time or super intensive, but still a helpful pressure-valve. Then it would be a gradual transition from him helping us more to us helping him more as he ages. The kids would be getting more capable as he needed more household help--we would take him to appointments, etc. Seemed like a nice plan, and we've been looking forward to it.\n\nThe thing is, he has just let us know that he doesn't plan to move anytime soon. Even though he doesn't have family where he is, he still has a thriving social life where he lives. Now, this makes all kinds of sense; he would have a harder time recreating all of that from scratch where we are. But it won't get any easier as he gets older. When my husband and I heard his current thinking, what that meant to us is that, if he plans to come live near us when his health is declining so much that he can't keep up his regular social activities, he would also no longer be able to provide any support for us with the kids. So we would then not only be his caregivers, but also apparently his whole social life.\n\nI'm not sure what to do or say about this. I just feel disappointed but awkward about it. In no way do I feel \\*entitled\\* to his support with the kids, and I fully agree that he currently has a great social life for a single guy his age, and I wouldn't want to pressure him to give it up. But I am feeling a bit crestfallen that, rather than getting a few years of support for our kids before we become his caregivers, it's looking more like we'll be on our own in a high-stress situation until we become caregivers for him as well.\n\nWhat do we do or say? What's a clear-eyed way to think about it?\n\nFwiw, he is so well-connected in his current community that he has said he might enjoy moving to a particular retirement home there where he is well liked and respected, so he could continue those friendships. I also have siblings elsewhere. So it's not as if we are his only option for closer community and care as he ages, but sounds like we are the ones he's considering most seriously.",

        "text": "So this is really uncomfortable and vulnerable for me to post, but I don\u2019t know where else to go. \nBefore I bring this up in couples counseling on Monday, I would like some opinions to see if I\u2019m over the line or maybe just even emotional. Here\u2019s the deal: things haven\u2019t been good between my husband and I for the better part of a year. We\u2019ve been in marriage counseling during this time, but I\u2019m not seeing much change on his end honestly. It\u2019s good for a day or two after a session and then back to normal. Here\u2019s my issues currently: defensiveness or anger when I express concerns, silent treatment, self-centered decision making, feeling unheard and invalidated, and emotionally alone. I constantly feel like I am walking on egg shells around him to avoid a full on blow up if I bring up something so minor. (Example: we have his nephews bday party in June; we were asked that same weekend to celebrate my dad\u2019s bday too; our families live 45 mins from each other, we are 3 hours from\nthem both. I suggested we go down on Saturday morning to nephews bday party and then go to my parents after the party and celebrate my dad and then make our way home Sunday after lunch. He wanted to stay Friday night at his family\u2019s, I said I think it works best if we go Saturday morning early instead. We both work Friday until 4:30, have to pickup our one year old son from daycare, then drive 3 hours just in time for our son to go to bed? When will he be able to even do dinner? It just doesn\u2019t make sense to me to go down Friday night, and I\u2019m trying to find a way to accommodate both our families and prioritize our son too. Well, husband didn\u2019t like that idea and gave me the silent treatment the rest of the evening; this is normal behaviour for him when he doesn\u2019t like or agree with something from me.) \nI know this dynamic isn\u2019t healthy and I\u2019m so tired and drained feeling. This is just one of MANY instances. It honestly seems like something like this occurs every few days at this point. Its either silent treatment or speaking to me in an aggressive harsh tone. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can go along with this. He just gets defensive if I express that I don\u2019t like the silent treatment and we should talk. I\u2019m at the point of considering separation. For my sanity and mental health, I don\u2019t know what else to do. I\u2019m 4 months pregnant with our second, we have a 14 month old son, and we\u2019re Christian\u2026 so I feel really guilty for even considering separation?! I don\u2019t want this to be feelings or emotions driven, I want what\u2019s best for my babies, I want to have a healthy Godly marriage, but I\u2019m feeling so stuck and at my rope\u2019s end\u2026.somethings got to give because I can\u2019t keep going on like this. I know I\u2019m to show love and grace to him, but I mean there has to be a point where I can do that for myself and show up to protect myself, right? \nI\u2019m considering telling him in our counseling session on Monday that I want separation because of these behaviours. Does this seem like a harsh or dramatic move? Be honest but gentle please ",

When I was a kid I really believed in love, to fell in love with someone, to take care for my girl, to help her, to be her protective half, to feel the real love for each other in basic you know what I mean. In the last couple of years I started to feel that this is not real.There is no such thing as a real love. I think that people get together for a benefits from each other and from the fear to die alone. Some of them even don't have a family bank account and everyone have their own Money and making a \"deal\" who will give certain amount of money for something. Some of them are giving money to the other and expect to give it back after while.Everything is so materialistic, so disgusting. Why the hell you need to live with someone, when there is no love, are the materialistic things will make you happy ? What is wrong with the people ? I am shocked. For me this is not a real family and more a friends with benefits living, or like roommates, it is quite pathetic. In this case I prefer to die alone, instead living this fake excuse of a family life.\n\nWhat do you think about this ?\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nHristiyan\n\n",

        "text": "I\u2019m a 32-year old happily married woman. My grandpa is and always has been, amazing with me. There has never been inappropriate behaviour, though I was never really left alone with him. I was always with my brother and my grandmother was always around and slept with us in the same bed when we did do sleepovers.\n\nI freaking love my grandparents and I quite often call them the \u201cGolden Grandparents\u201d because they\u2019ve been so perfect in so many ways. \n\nMemories and puzzle pieces over the last 32-years have added up for me recently and I\u2019m concerned about the safety of my little cousins that live with them, particularly the two little girls. One is 11, turning 12 and the other is 1.\n\nWhen I was a little girl, I learned that there were rumours that my grandpa molested my aunt (his niece). My mom defended my grandpa ferociously. \n\nWhen I was a teenager, there was an instance where there was some tension between my grandparents because my grandpa had gone over to a family friends house to help them paint and the woman of the house didn\u2019t want him there because he was staring at her daughter (or something to that affect). My grandma was distressed by the whole thing. \n\nI always wondered why my grandma\u2019s side of the family never came over and embraced my grandpa the way that they did with everyone else. There was always some unspoken distance there.\n\nThe part of all of this that really makes me sick to my stomach in all of this is my assumptions about my mom. \n\nShe was always very protective of me to the point where it has ruined our relationship. She wanted me to always dress very modestly, even at home, to the point where we would get in huge arguments. She also asked me one time as a teenager if my dad (who she is still married to) had ever touched me. The question shocked me\u2026 of course not. How do you not trust your husband?! He\u2019s my dad. \n\nRecently, about 4-years ago, she confided in me that \u201csomething happened to me when I was little. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so hard on you.\u201d And then she sobbed in my arms and said \u201cI was just a child.\u201d I originally thought it was an uncle of hers but my suspicions have shifted to my grandpa.\n\nMy grandma also said something a few years ago that made me think about things deeper\u2026 she said something to the affect of what if a man gets too drunk and accidentally does something to his daughter thinking it\u2019s his wife. I know my grandpa used to drink but he\u2019s been completely sober since before I was born and I think there was an incident that led to sobriety.\n\nI plan on contacting child services to get those kids out of the house (they have their dad, my uncle, and their mom, they\u2019re not going to foster homes, they\u2019re going to be fine) but I wanted to get some outside opinions on what to do or if I\u2019m overreacting especially since I had such a wonderful experience with my grandpa.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t leave my daughter alone with him and I think the mother of the those kids has a right to learn about the rumours. \n\nTLDR: I\u2019m worried my grandpa is a predator who might hurt my two little girl cousins who live with him (and their parents). He\u2019s NEVER done anything to me though. I plan on calling child services. What do you think?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "post-author": "MoonStoneKnight",
        "text": "I'm not sure why I'm this writing here, maybe to get some sense of closure. After 27 years, my whole life, I want to feel like I finally have this wrapped up somewhat. Looking back, I now see the **many** red flags that littered my father's behaviour, abuse that doesn't leave visible bruises or scars, but they are there nonetheless. I hope it will help someone see the pattern, that it's not in their head, that it's not \"nothing\", like how I was led to believe...\n\nWarning, this is a **long** story.\n\nRelevant people to this story: I (27F) my younger brother (23M) our father (60M) our recently deceased mom (59F) my father's girlfriend, her son and her daughter from a previous relationship. I don't remember their exact age. But know that she's about 10 years younger than my father and her kids were about 2 and 3 years younger than my brother.\n\nSo, this tale starts in 1986, when my parents at the age of 22 got married. The first red flag in a way. Where I live, until you're 25, while you're legally an adult, you are still sort of financially still linked to your parents in regard to taxation. My father, who has a list of (mainly) mommy issues 10 miles long, wanted to escape that. Marriage was the quickest way to do it so he asked my mom to marry him. He married my mother to piss off his parents and to cut them out of his life. My mom, she was smart enough to see that he needed help but also naive enough to think she could \"fix\" or \"save him\". Spoiler alert, she couldn't.\n\nThings were kind of good, though there were many moments through the years that made my mom's family very wary of my father. They never liked him but since he was socially functioning, had a good education and job and wasn't abusing my mom, they tolerated him. They were never mean or even remotely close to rude with him. They just didn't go out of their way to hang with him.\n\nThen, after 11 years, they had their first child, me. Next major red flag. My mom's labour was very long, 26 hours and it very nearly ended with both her and me dead. Through the whole thing? My father was straight up nasty with the staff, passive-aggressive and didn't offer a shred of sympathy to my mom. The whole time he was complaining about how long it was taking and made everything about him. And then, while my mom was still under the anesthesia after my birth, he filed my birth certificated with a name he wanted and didn't ask my mom if she liked it. His justification: he didn't \"feel allowed\" to voice his preference and acted on impulse. Here begins a pattern, he's always the victim. Whenever he does something he knows is wrong, he'll always frame it as though he had no choice or we don't understand him.\n\nLike most people, I don't remember all that much from the first 4 years of my life. All I know is that nothing majorly bad happened. Back then, even my mom's family described him as \"involved and loving\". Then my little bother was born. That's when things really started going down. My father, who I now know is a vulnerable narcissist, right way hated not being the male center of my mom's world. He became extremely jealous of my little brother, who was getting the healthy mother-son relationship he never had.\n\nOver the next 6 years, his behaviour increasingly got worse and worse. It got to a point where he threatened my mom with a hammer after he hit himself on the thumb and she had the \"nerve\" to ask if he was okay. He became increasingly more passive-agressive, more prone to sudden burst of animosity over the smallest matter, his patience was non-existent, he got pissed at the slightest thing that didn't go his way. Exemple: I had motion sickness as a child. He would get angry at my for being sick during car trips for making a mess and \"wasting his time\". Like I chose to be sick to piss him off.\n\nEventually, he left my mother. Upon leaving, he accused her of \"caging\" him, called her needy, a hypocrite and a bunch of other rather mean things. But my mom, bless her, didn't stoop to his level. She stayed level-headed for her children's sake. She didn't want their separation to devolve into a full blown legal battle, so she was the bigger person and made sure things went as smoothly as possible.\n\nLess than 6 months after the divorce, my father introduced me and my brother to his new girlfriend. Whom he totally wasn't in a relationship with before he left my mom. I cannot emphasize enough how **sarcastic** I'm being here. He cheated on my mother with that woman, his assistant from work, for 2 WHOLE YEARS. A fact he **never** admitted.\n\nAs quickly as humanly possible, he moved in with her. Every time we went to visit before that, he would terrorize me and my brother into being perfect little angels of politeness. No matter what her downright evil spawns did to us. And they hurt us. They were younger but we were scared into compliance, for I knew that my father could get violent, I had seen it before, how his eyes would get dark and fill with hatred. Though he never did hit us, the threat was always there. So... we accepted the abuse, got objects thrown at us, got spat on, clawed and punched.\n\nWhen he moved in with her, us with him, we were put into a small room in the basement for over a year before we actually got our own rooms. Still, our personal effects were stolen and broken, but we couldn't speak up. Our father wanted his \"perfect new family\" and we were terrified kids. We endured. We learned to take care of ourselves, to ask and need nothing, to cry in silence. Our father paraded us, his perfect blended family that thrived despite insane jealous exes, which was a total lie.\n\nThis is already a long story so I'll try to be brief about the next 8 years. Simply put, me and my brother became his toys. Cute little dolls he could dress and arrange however it pleased him. Our sole reason to exist was to make him and his new life look good.  We were strictly forbidden from talking about our mother. We had to pretend she didn't exist. And whenever his girlfriend made mean comments about her, we had to keep our mouths shut. He didn't tolerate **anything** that threatened that perfect image.\n\nExemple: I was being violently bullied in high school. I mean attempts at sexual assault, harassement, my things stolen and physical assaults. I begged to change school. My father's answer? That I deserved it. That it was my fault. That I enjoyed \"being the victim\", that it was my \"whole personality\" and that it was my job to make it stop. I endured 5 years of abuse at school and at home. My mom... she did her best but my father had everything playing in his favour. He had the better job, better living situation and his abuse left no trace. She couldn't get full custody because he was playing the legal system like fiddle.\n\nI endured until I was 18 yrs old. One day, I packed my things, went to my mom, called my father to tell him I'd never come back and that was it. He treated it as me being a \"dramatic selfish teenager\" and \"just a phase\". But I held my ground and truly never went back.\n\nEventually, he took the situation more seriously. Like every narcissist after they get dumped, he lovebombed me. He couldn't accept my departure for it was a MAJOR stain on his \"perfect\" story. I didn't make a scene, but it exposed things nonetheless. People asked questions and he HATED it. So he spent years, until very recently, trying to get me to come back and pretend nothing happened.\n\n4 years ago, my mom got sick with ovarian cancer... For those familiar with the diagnostic, it's extremely rare for that cancer to be diagnosed in time to be effectively treated. My mom was condemned from that day. But she fought hard to stay with me and my brother as long as possible. Eventually, it became clear there was nothing more to do, she chose to pass on her own terms. She died peacefully, free of pain, surrounded by family and dear friends. I miss her everyday so much...\n\nAt her funeral, my brother and I kept it together. We put on a brave face and saw the ceremony through to the end. We had a little reception later, my mom had insisted on a good caterer and really good wine for everyone. And only tulips for the flowers, white and yellow. My father had been allowed to come, he had kind of tried to make amends before our mom died, or so I thought. During the reception, he had the nerve to come up to me and my brother to cry about how hard it was FOR HIM, never even once asked how we were doing after loosing our mom. I wanted nothing more than to punch him. But I kept my composure and politely invited him to not stay long.\n\nAbout a year later... my father calls me to talk about how he wants to reconcile and move on. He complains to me about my aunts (my mom's sisters) and wants me to stop them from talking to him. He complains that when he left he was \"thrown out\" and could never collect his things. He says in that \"woe is me\" voice that HE'S the one who knew my mom the longest, how hurt he was by her passing and how despite that he was ready to move on, so I should be as well. I hung up.\n\n**So.** It's not my responsability to play mediator between him and my mom's family, they're all adults and their beef isn't mine. He wasn't thrown out by anyone, my mom invited him MULTIPLE times to come get his stuff, he chose not to. True, he lived a long time with her, but that doesn't mean it's harder for him or that his pain is worth more. It's not a competition, we're all grieving. After spending years being forbidden to talk about her, being forced to pretend she didn't exist at HIS DEMAND, hearing him use the time he spent with her like that... It was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nI didn't call him back. I wrote a letter in which I stated my resolve to cut him out of my life. I didn't insult him, I wasn't rude. I stated many of the facts of this story, called him out on his hypocrisy and that I was done. I won't spend the rest of my life waiting on him to have accountability for his actions or develop a semblance of emotional maturity. I said my goodbyes and that I would bear my mom's family name from now on instead of his.\n\nHis reaction, a 3 page long letter in which he accused me of being judgemental, ignorant, selfish and immature. He says that I never asked \"his version\" and that I was in no position to make such a decision given the circumstances. But here's the thing, I did ask. I did try to understand, asked him to tell me what was going on throughout the years. Why this whole \"new family\" thing mattered so much. I tried so much. But every single time, I was rebuked with one of these statements: \"You're too young to understand so it's pointless telling you\" \"It's none of your business\" or \"I'm the adult, I make the decisions here, you obey\".\n\nAfter years like this... eventually I stopped asking. But \"his version\" doesn't matter, I know that now. Because NOTHING can justify or excuse the way he treated us. And keeping me in ignorance was just a way to assert his power over me. But if I don't care about it anymore, then he has no power over me anymore.\n\nNow... a few months later. I guess I'm trying to make sense of it all. I'm trying to make a list of what I have learned, to love my \"inner child\" who was deprived of so much (emotionally speaking), emotionally and psychologically abused for 18 years. As a little girl and teen, I yearned for someone to save me. Now I realize that someone did, the adult me.\n\nI got diagnosed as an autistic woman. The abusive situation I was in made me mask even more but now I'm learning how to embrace my neurodivergence and live with it in a way that doesn't constantly hurt me. I came out as a panromantic asexual, embraced many of my interests I had been keeping under lock and key for years. I have a wonderful job and friends. I will soon buy my own home, have a space that's entirely mine, in my image and safe. It will be comfy and soft. I'm going to get a dog trained to support people with C-PTSD to help with my dissociative episodes and I'm in therapy.\n\nThe road had been so long... If someone had told me when I was 16 that one day I would be free from him, that I would have the strength to leave him behind and live my best life, I wouldn't have believed it. But here I am. I still hurt, the path to healing is going to be a long one but, I don't have the words to express how **worth the time** it is.\n\nTo anyone reading this stuck in a similar situation, with an abuser who doesn't leave bruises but strives to destroy who you are on a fundamental level, may you realize how brave and strong you are. May you see your worth, see through the lies and gaslighting. Run, don't wait on them to change or be better, they never will. Run, run and don't look back. Your life is out there. I won't pretend it's easy or that it doesn't hurt, but what's out there is better than anything you can imagine.\n\nYou are loved, you are strong, you are worth more than they will ever know.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nMy father was emotionally and psychologically abusive for most of my life. He controlled the narrative, denied accountability, and forced me to live under the illusion of his \u201cperfect family\u201d while silencing me and erasing my mother. After years of gaslighting, fear, and being treated like a prop in his life, I walked away at 18 and never looked back. I tried to give him chances. I tried to understand. But he never changed. So I chose myself. I cut ties, reclaimed my name, and began healing. It\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s worth it.  \nIf you\u2019re in a similar place: you are not crazy, you are not weak \u2014 and you *can* leave. You *can* heal.",

        "text": "I have a 35 year old mentally challenged sister. She acts like a 3 year old and has never matured. My mom is mean, bitter, and angry. She was never affectionate to me and my siblings. I don\u2019t like my mother, I just tolerate her, maybe if she was a nice person I could\u2019ve had a normal relationship with her like what other people have.\nMy mom hates my sister, and has absolutely no patience, or compassion for her, and only tolerates her for her disability check that she pockets most of. My mom screams at my sister all the time and hits her over the most minor things. Also at the same time she pretends to be this oh-so caring mother to her mentally challenged adult daughter when she\u2019s around other people. The way she acts in front of me and siblings and in front of other people you would think are two different people, and my mom cares more about what other people think of her than the wellbeing of her own kids. I don\u2019t live with my mom anymore and have moved hours away from my hometown I come back to town every once in a while to see friends and family, and stay at my mom\u2019s house when I\u2019m back.\nSo this is what happened just recently. Me, my mom, and my aunty were all together at my mom\u2019s house, my sister was in her room. My sister starts throwing a huge screaming tantrum, and throwing stuff and breaking things in her room. I tried to calm her down, but there was absolutely no reasoning with her, I would of just ignored it because like a baby she will literally get over it in 20 minutes. But no my cunt of mom goes to her room and begins to hit her over and over, and I grabbed a broom, and hit my mom to make her stop, and she acted shocked that I did that, and started screaming at me that she\u2019s calling the cops on me for assault which is ironic because she was just beating my mentally challenged sister. Then she denied hitting my sister after it happened even though both me and my aunty saw it. My aunty goes into my sisters room and tries to calm her down and just talk to her. Something my mom would never do in a million years, and it worked. \nMy mom goes on and on how I attacked her and that she wants me gone. I told her \u201cI hit you once, you hit me hundreds of times, get over it\u201d she acted fucking shocked that I said that, that I called out her bullshit, and than denied ever hitting me as a kid, and than acting like being hit as a kid is not a big deal and is not abuse.\nSocial services have been called on my mom and there\u2019s not really much that could be done.  There\u2019s is no one in our family that could take in my sister. I live 6 hours away in Toronto and can\u2019t take her with me. I feel like there\u2019s literally nothing I can do, I wanna help my sister, and she\u2019s stuck with an abusive parent who has no patience or compassion to take care of mentally challenged person.\n",

I feel so much love when I am with Ethan or Jack, almost like a motherly instinct to protect and make them happy. But every time I\u2019m around Shane I just feel annoyed and I don\u2019t want to spend time with him. I don\u2019t feel a \u201cspecial\u201d connection to him, it feels like he is just another person that lives in my house.\n\nI think it may be because Shane was born in a very difficult part of my life when I was very dependent on my dad, every time I see my dad and Shane spending time together I get annoyed, in my head I guess I think everyone is annoyed by Shane so why is Dad acting that way. \n\nI also feel it may be a personality difference. Ethan and Jack are very outgoing, boisterous and funny. But Shane is, well what I would call a crybaby. Which I don\u2019t really think he is, I get really mad every time he cries and I think to myself that he is so whiny. His mom (my stepmom) also is what you would call a \u201cgentle parent\u201d, my dad once got berated for telling Shane to shut up, so every time he cries he is coddled. I obviously know he\u2019s a toddler, he\u2019s going to cry over everything, but when Ethan or Jack cry I rush over and try and help, but when Shane does I literally can\u2019t do anything but walk away I get so annoyed.\n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do, I always just thought this feeling would go away eventually and I would feel the same way for him as my other brothers but I still find myself annoyed every time he speaks to me, we bring him anywhere, anytime he gets attention off my dad and anytime he really does anything. I feel terrible, I know he\u2019s only a baby and he\u2019s not doing anything wrong but I just get so annoyed ( Not in a physical way, more in a eye-rolling way) and I literally cannot help it.\n\nIf anyone has any advice for me please let me know.

He became distant from me when he began to go through puberty which I understood, we got closer when we went to the same high school, but not that he's gotten married our relationship and his relationship with our mother has deteriorated exponentially. \n\nHe and our mother used to be extremely close. He would wake up early just to spend time with her and sit next to her. This was never something she enforced, it was just the main time when he could have alone time with mom. Even when he moved out he stayed close with her, going to her for advice and talking about how badly he wanted to live close to her and our father. It's not some weird mother-son relationship, our mother has always done her best to give us our space even as children to grow and become our own person, while also giving us the attention we needed as children or teens.\n\nEverything was fine, he and I had become closer as siblings (tolerating each other and actually becoming friends), but when he got married he practically cut me off completely and began continuously bombarding our mother with criticism. So much criticism that she would end up crying from how harshly he was to her on the phone. I understand us having a strained relationship, we have never been super close, but how harsh he has been to our mother is just astounding to me. He doesn't act the same to our father, even though my father is the one who was emotionally absent and a workaholic during our childhood, he just says \"That's dad\" when our father has outbursts. Even his new wife has been criticizing our mother, giving him more ammo when he comes to talk with our mother. \n\nHe had no issues like this when he was dating or engaged to his now wife, but after marriage he seemed to make a total flip on how he treated all of us. He even began using his wife's pregnancy as something to hold over our mom's head when he talks to her. Is this just how boys behave when they get married? Does this have something to do with his wife (who is a very domineering person, self proclaimed)? \n\nWe are all trying to just give him his space and let him grow into his new family but it just seems to be getting worse and it hurts me to see how much it hurts our mother being treated so cruelly.

Still, growing up I always had a good relationship with them bc I always went their way in order to not cause fights etc. Recently, I started realising that I will never be my own person unless I start living my life the way I want to. So, I started changing my style, and picked up some hobbies. Mind you I'm on my last year of uni, so I've been an adult for a while now. My parents really criticise me for everything (the way I dress, the hobbies I have, everything I do and everywhere I go) even though it's all pretty normal. I am a reasonable person, and too old to be a rebellious teenager. But they are really hostile with me and I don't know what to do. \n\nFor some months now I've been in a band. It's pretty chill and I really like it. However my mom threatens me that she will stop allowing me (I'm 22 mind you) to go to practices any more because \"in these studios people are given drugs and are being raped\" (which sounds pretty unreasonable bc we're not the Beatles we're just some random no name band that noone knows). She told me she's scared that something bad will happen to me. Also, she hates the fact that I buy second hand clothes. \nThe thing is, I had ordered a second hand corset and it has just arrived. Also, tomorrow I have band practice. I hate lying to them and make it a principle to never do. But they will start yelling at me if they find out the truth. It would be really easy for me to tell them that I'm going out with a friend and just go to band practice.\n\nWhat should I do?? All I want is a good relationship with my parents but they're freaking out over nothing, yelling at me and being extremely rude to me...",

        "text": "For years, my family\u2014uncles, aunts, cousins\u2014used to all get together for holidays with my grandparents. As we\u2019ve all gotten older, that\u2019s happened less and less. I\u2019m 25 now, and it basically doesn\u2019t happen anymore. That\u2019s understandable\u2014people have their own lives.\n\nI still live in the same area as my mom and grandparents (about 20 minutes away). My uncles, aunts, and cousins don\u2019t visit us much anymore, sometimes saying they find our home state \u201cboring.\u201d But they always push for us to travel to them. I\u2019ve got family on both the west and east coasts, and I\u2019m more centrally located.\n\nThese days, I\u2019m focused on building my own life. I work a lot so I can afford the things I enjoy. I don\u2019t take many vacations. If I do travel, it\u2019s usually for something I personally want to do\u2014short-term events or trips. I\u2019m not really interested in spending money on hotels just to go see family, especially when it often leads to drama.\n\nDo I *like* working so much? Of course not. But when I have time off, I genuinely enjoy relaxing at home. Both sides of my extended family seem to think I can just take multiple vacations a year while still covering rent, car payments, groceries, etc. I don\u2019t make amazing money, but I get by and manage to save a little.\n\nNow here\u2019s the actual situation.\n\nMy west coast family planned a surprise trip to visit someone on the east coast. They told me about it a month ahead of time. I *wanted* to go\u2014this family member is a good person, and it\u2019s nothing against them. But every time I talk to the family, it\u2019s always \u201cwe never see you,\u201d or \u201cwhy are you always working or at home,\u201d like guilt gets thrown at me constantly.\n\nThe trip would require me to take three vacation days. I earn vacation time through hours worked\u2014it\u2019s not guaranteed\u2014and I have to request it in advance. But I had already used most of my vacation days that same month for a trip with my girlfriend. I didn\u2019t have enough time off left. Plus, I didn\u2019t want to pay for a flight, and I really don\u2019t enjoy flying anymore. (Used to love it as a kid\u2014bad experiences changed that.) Driving would\u2019ve taken 21 hours, and I honestly wouldn\u2019t have minded, but the timing just didn\u2019t work.\n\nI let them know ahead of time, not last-minute, and said maybe I could visit later in the year. The response was... not great. They were very upset.\n\nMy mom also didn\u2019t go for her own personal reasons. Because of that, I got lumped into the \u201cwe don\u2019t care about family\u201d group along with her. They have their own issues with her, and sometimes those get unfairly pushed onto me to deal with or \u201cfix.\u201d\n\nWhen I was a kid, visits were different\u2014arcades, comic shops, fun stuff. Now that I\u2019m an adult, it\u2019s more like: we go out to eat, say hi, then bye. I\u2019d rather go do my own thing\u2014maybe hike somewhere\u2014and head home. Am I just being a selfish asshole?\n\nI used to take trips to visit family all the time, but that was in high school. I had time, no bills, no responsibilities. Now I\u2019m trying to build a future for myself, and it's a different world.\n\nAnd while I don\u2019t love airing personal family history online, things haven\u2019t always been sunshine and rainbows. There\u2019s been a lot of internal conflict. Some family members have judged me for the college I went to or for wanting to stay near my hometown\u2014where my *friends* are.\n\nEach side of the family has, at one point, tried to convince me to uproot my life and move in with them, with the vague reasoning of \u201cit\u2019d be better for you.\u201d But I have no friends in those areas, no job experience or references, or experience living there\u2014so\u2026 it\u2019s a lot. Maybe they truly *do* want what\u2019s best for me, but for the first time in my life, I want to be in charge of my own destiny.\n\nTo sum this up, I don\u2019t know if anyone else can relate. That feeling of being excited to see family\u2014until you remember why you don\u2019t do it that often anymore. Because it always turns into something. An argument. Gossip. Drama about someone who isn\u2019t even there. I\u2019m just tired of it.\n\nSorry this was so long. Just needed to vent after getting absolutely wrecked over the phone by family.\n\nIs it time I just move somewhere random and go ghost on everyone? Haha, just kidding\u2026 kinda.\n\nAny input or advice would be appreciated. \ud83d\udc99",

        "text": "The other day, I asked my mom to turn off the light in my bedroom because she never turns it off and I don't want the lightbulb to dim faster. She got mad at me, as if I had said something wrong or disrespectful, and I didn't understand why. After that, I started to feel like my mom doesn't see me as a person.\n\nLike, I remember I once had an argument where I told her that I don't lie how she talks to me sometimes, but she turned it on me and made it seem like I was in the wrong for expressing how I felt. She also never apologizes, calls me dramatic for no reason and dismisses my feelings and acts like she can do whatever she wants, all because she gave birth to me.\n\nBecause of all of this, I feel like she doesn't see me as a person, but rather as an extension of herself. She always wants me to do what she wants, and acts like I'm against her when I don't. She also always wants me to look good when I'm out of the house. Which is something that I don't think is bad in it of itself, but I feel like she wants me to look good (n her perspective) because she thinks of what people will think of her when they see me.\n\nAs for my dad, I feel like him and my mom think the same way. He says whatever he wants about me without worrying about how I'd feel about it. He would fat shame me a lot.\n\nLike, I remember, when I was in primary school I once bought ice cream for myself when I was on my way home. My dad found out about it and started calling me fat, saying things like how I'm just like a worm that eats everything. I'm turning 17 this year and I don't care about it anymore, but that memory is one of the first things I think about, when I think about my dad.\n\nLast year, In another argument I had with my mom, my dad found out about it, yelled at me and hit me with a wooden board so hard that it broke because i was \"troubling his wife\" and then just went on about his day. And then when I brought it up with mt mom, she asked if i was \"still upset about that?\" as if it was just the most normal thing in the world\n\nTL:DR, I feel like my parents just see me as someone they can control and do whatever the want to and not as a  person, which Is why they don't like it when I express my feelings, because it goes against who they want me to be.\n\n",

        "text": "\n\nI\u2019m 16F and I just got into an argument with my mom. I\u2019m the oldest sibling.\n\nLet me start from the beginning. Earlier this morning, my mom was arguing on the phone with my younger siblings\u2019 dad, which already put her in a bad mood. Later on, I was on the phone with my dad but realized I should wash the dishes. While I was doing that, my entire family came downstairs. It got extremely noisy, with the water running and everyone talking, so I told my dad I\u2019d call him back and hung up.\n\nMy mom immediately got defensive, asking why I always get off the phone with my dad when she\u2019s around, and said that my dad and I could talk, like she wasn\u2019t the reason. But the noise from the sink and everyone else made it impossible for him to hear me.\n\nShe then said she\u2019d just call my dad herself. But her and my dad\u2019s history isn\u2019t great. My dad has told me many times he doesn\u2019t want to speak to or have anything to do with her unless it\u2019s about me. My mom, however, still thinks my dad likes her and would cheat on his wife for her.\n\nSo I responded, truthfully, \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants to speak to you.\u201d That\u2019s when she completely blew up. She said she\u2019s the one who brought me and my dad together, and I\u2019m the one pushing them apart. She grounded me for saying that. I can\u2019t go anywhere\u2014not even to the gym.\n\nShe yelled that last year, for my 16th birthday, they were able to be together for a dinner for my sake, and that I\u2019m ruining everything. She left me alone for a few hours, but then came back and started yelling again. She acted like I\u2019m the reason my dad doesn\u2019t like her. She said she\u2019s going to cancel the birthday plans she had with my dad for my 17th and that I should \u201cdo whatever the fuck I want.\u201d And honestly, I\u2019m okay with that.\n\nSo many bad things have been happening lately that I can\u2019t even think clearly. She told me I can\u2019t see anyone, and she started calling me names like a bitch and even said she hates me. She said she wishes I was the sibling who was fatherless and that my brother should\u2019ve had a dad instead of me.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to handle all of this. I really want to move out, but my dad\u2019s house is too far away, and rent is too expensive. My mind is spiraling\u2014from that fight and also from a recent rejection I got from a boy I\u2019m in love with. We talk so much that it physically hurts after being rejected. And now with everything going on with my mom, I just feel like I\u2019m nothing.\n\nAm I really so ugly, annoying, and stupid that he didn\u2019t choose me? That my mom dislikes me? I feel so small.\n",

For your mum to call you rude names and say those awful things, she must have something going horribly wrong with her life, or with her mental health. \n\nSo no, I doubt she treats you like that for any reason other than herself. As for the boy - I wish your mum could support you with that. You probably feel worse because you don\u2019t have a supportive mum to make you feel loved and heard when it comes to it. \n\nSometimes, we have feelings for people and they aren\u2019t reciprocated, and that\u2019s ok.

        "post-author": "darwizzythegoat27",
        "text": "Our dad (62M) and mum split during the first COVID lockdown in 2020, which was tough but expected. Their divorce was messy, officially finalised around mid-2021, with lots of arguments over the house and finances. Dad moved out a few months after they separated. Me and my brother would regulary visit at his new flat, but we all stayed living with mum, as we had lived their since 2009.\n\nBoth our parents have been in various relationships since the divorce. Mum has settled down with a guy around her age\u2014they\u2019ve been together for a couple of years but aren\u2019t engaged or anything. Dad, on the other hand, dated a few women close to his age, but that changed in August 2023 when he started seeing G.\n\nIn early August 2023, dad told us he was seeing a woman (let\u2019s call her G). At this stage, we had only seen a photo of her \u2014 and she looked quite young, which immediately raised some eyebrows. In September, dad got a job offer in Bangkok and moved there for a few months to obtain a work visa. He and G stayed together long-distance, and she visited him out there from time to time We hadn\u2019t met her in person yet. At the time, we were told she was around 33 or 34, but later we found out she was actually 28 \u2014 only four years older than me.\n\nWe met G for the first time in late December 2023 \u2014 once on Boxing Day at a family gathering, and again a couple of days later for a meal. Then, on January 2nd, 2024, dad took me, my brother, and my sister to a pub and announced that he had gotten engaged to G on New Year\u2019s Eve. We were shocked, upset, and disappointed. They\u2019d only been together for about five months, had never properly lived together, and we\u2019d only met her twice. While I tried to stay neutral to keep the peace, my siblings were visibly upset. Dad told us, \u201cI\u2019ve never been happier,\u201d but it was hard to process.\n\nIn July 2024, we visited Dad and G in Thailand. G was standoffish, zoned out during travel, and barely spoke to us. Dad said it was because her dad was ill, which was sad, but this excuse became a pattern whenever she was distant. She even missed an excursion that dad paid a lot for, saying she wasn\u2019t feeling well. It felt like she wasn\u2019t making the most of the holiday or the time with Dad and us. During the trip, Dad asked us to \u201ctry harder\u201d with her, which didn\u2019t sit well \u2014 we believe she\u2019s the one joining our family and should be making more effort, since we\u2019d only met her about five times and she rarely engaged, especially with my younger sister.\n\nDad announced he was moving back to the UK in March 2025 and had rented a house with G. She actually moved into the house about a month earlier, in February, before Dad returned. Despite this, G didn\u2019t make any effort to contact or reach out to us. When we finally met in late March, I introduced my girlfriend to Dad and G\u2014and it was obvious my girlfriend was friendlier to both of them than G had ever been to us. It felt really strange.\n\nFor my sister\u2019s 18th birthday, we went to London for the evening. Dad and G came but left early because G\u2019s dog was home alone and needed looking after. A few weeks later, we went to Dad\u2019s for a meal and to watch football. G wasn\u2019t very chatty during the meal and left before the football started, didn't even say goodbye to us. Dad said she was suffering badly from her period. I don\u2019t want to be insensitive\u2014I know periods affect people differently\u2014but at 28, it felt like a weak excuse not to stay and be present with us.\n\nThe main issue: they\u2019ve been engaged for nearly a year and a half. We don\u2019t know if they\u2019re secretly married, but a wedding feels inevitable. We\u2019ve joked about objecting or not attending. But that\u2019s obviously not a joke if we\u2019re seriously considering it.\n\nHow do we have a respectful, productive conversation with our dad about our discomfort with his relationship? We feel G is cold, disinterested, and never made an effort to bond with us \u2014 even after nearly two years. Are we wrong to feel alienated? What\u2019s the best way to raise this without causing a complete fallout?\n\nTL:DR: Our dad (62M) is engaged to a woman (28F) only four years older than me (24M). My siblings (22M, 18F) and I have met her maybe six or seven times in one and a half years. She\u2019s never made any real effort to connect with us. We are not thinking about skipping their future wedding or objecting to us. How do we talk to dad about our concerns without damaging our relationship? ",

This will not go over well but it needs to be said, he needs to hear the truth and know it\u2019s effecting his child and their relationship with him. I would even go as far as telling him you\u2019re thinking of go LC or NC because you can tell she has no interest in getting to know any of you and st this point it all seems forced. And that if he cares about his relationship with you all he needs to makes some changes in how he interacts with you and your siblings. It is his life and he can live it as he chooses but his choices affect the rest of his family and could have bad consequences. \n\nI would also question the financial side of the situation if she doesn\u2019t have her own money, career or goals. Then I would say she is probably a sugar baby. Hopefully, I\u2019m wrong on that front and she truly care for him. \n\nPS:  Should they marry and your father passes G will want and take everything.

Sex.  And you guys aren't providing that for him, cannot provide that for him.\n\nJust put up with it.  Pray that he doesn't marry her, doesn't leave what he has to her.  Expect that she might leave him when he gets infirm, but a woman his own age could do that too.\n\nArrange to see him without her, whenever possible, and when she is there, be pleasant, but focus on your relationship with your father.  Do not expect her to connect with you guys - I mean, she is almost the same age as you!  She is probably uncomfortable and ashamed around you, of her involvement with your father.\n\nMaybe he will come to his senses.  Maybe he won't.

While sorting through things, I found a hidden drawer in his desk with a bunch of letters, passports, and photos \u2014 all from different countries, different names, and spanning decades.\n\n\n\nAt first, I thought he might have been involved in something shady, but as I read the letters, it turns out he was secretly helping refugees during the Cold War. He was part of a small underground network that helped people escape from communist countries and find new lives here. None of us had any idea \u2014 my grandpa was always so quiet and humble.\n\n\n\nWhat blew me away was that he risked his own safety multiple times to help strangers. Some of the letters were from people who are now spread all over the world, thanking him for saving their lives.\n\n\n\nThe craziest part? One of the passports had my grandma\u2019s name, but with a completely different identity \u2014 apparently, she was involved too, but she never told anyone. My whole family has been piecing together this incredible story about who they really were.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m still trying to process it all, but honestly, I\u2019m proud as hell of them.

I\u2019ve always been the target of the house, especially bc im the one with all of the mental illnesses and they all like to gang up on me. they make fun of me, use it against me, make me feel like a horrible person for things i don\u2019t realize or can\u2019t control. i\u2019ve made some bad mistakes in life and they were there to support me, but they emotionally abused me at the same time. they\u2019ve been emotionally abusive my entire life. i thought things would get better once my sister left for college, bc she tortures me the most when she\u2019s angry, and it somewhat did but then everything i did became an issue. i don\u2019t want to fix our relationships anymore. i don\u2019t care about it. i feel bad for that but it\u2019s true. i want to get out of this house so badly but i have nowhere else to go. they aren\u2019t bad people but they torture me and hold things over my head yet treat my sister like she\u2019s a God bc she didn\u2019t fuck up like i did. she can say whatever she wants to them in comparison to what im allowed to say. she can be as disrespectful as she wants and if i so much as tell my father no, he blows up and goes on a rampage about how i suck basically. i\u2019m not perfect and i never claimed to be but they also never tried to understand the awful issues i have with mental health (MAD, MDD, ADHD, BP, PTSD..). long story short im fucked up and they refuse to accept it. i feel like im 12 years old sitting in my bed sobbing until i couldn\u2019t cry anymore all over again. the only difference is i stopped self harming and took up addiction. i drink partially because of them. i know it\u2019s only going to get worse if i don\u2019t get out but i have no other options right now. my last 2 therapists said ill never be happy until i stop living with them. i use to lay awake for hours asking God why they didn\u2019t care about MY feelings or what I was going through, just my sister. i couldn\u2019t give a fuck less anymore. i just need to escape",

        "text": "Context: I, 15 male, live with my grandma and my mom. My grandma is and always has been the person that has cared for me. On the other side my mom fucking hates my grandma, her own mother. For as long as I can remember she has screamed, sweared and threatened her almost daily. She smokes like two packs a day and is an alcoholic, even tho her boyfriend literally DIED of alcohol a few years ago. She wasn't directly abusive to me, but I think finding her drawings and writings of wanting to shove my grandma's head in the freezer when I was 7-8 did that for her. This is and has always been something normal. She has always taken money from grandma and almost never returned all of it. My grandma hasn't done anything to her and is paying for all the bills and is raising me. Outside of that my life is pretty normal.\nFor the past year she has tried to be, you know, a mother, but that's complete bullshit. The only thing she does is sometimes ask me how's school and make me food I haven't even asked for. Like two months ago, while she was screaming at grandma for no reason, I just screamed at her to stop. I guess she was a little drunk, but that doesn't excuse that she called me \"a fucking useless piece of shit\". From that moment I just don't mind saying anything to my grandma about her, how I want to kill her, torture her, rip her nervous system out and light it on fire, but make it so that she still feels everything and is in pure agony. So, my question, is it bad that I have these thoughts? Keep in mind she's saying similar things to her own mother and I'm just using what she has taught me. Sometimes I get so infuriated my whole body shakes. I really want her to get old and die in mystery. I have told myself that this is the only sin that I truly accept to have. Is it so bad? Am I a bad person for that? ",

She uses our parents, she declines consequences for her wrong behavior, she lies, she steals my stuff, she doesn\u2019t even talk to my parents only if she need something. She only talks about herself and boys and she is just in my eyes such a bad person. Is it wrong that I don\u2019t like her and even fantasize about moving away from her when I\u2019m older. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s new. She always did bad things to me. When we were younger and I couldn\u2019t help myself it was the worse. The control she had over me always terrified me when I was younger. Now that I\u2019m older I\u2019m sorry for my younger self when I see videos of me and her while she is bullying me. for example we were 5 and 7 and i didn\u2019t want her to play with my doll she put soap on my toothbrush or told me that she was gonna \u2620\ufe0f me in the night while I was sleeping. Still after every fight I give in and be nice to her because I just want a good relationship. But since one year. I don\u2019t want it. I wanna be far away from her and never talk to this face again.

Anyways, Being in such a large family its difficult to get quality time with ANYONE. And i mean anyone. I barely knew anyone in my family besides my mom, dad, and siblings. I think it was the same with my siblings. One of my younger sisters, 20 F, Lets just call her Emma. Emma was ALWAYS trying to get with guys. Ever since i was a kid, I had to try to make her make rational decisions because most of the guys she dated were douches. She eventually met a guy on tinder and they clicked. She loved him, I thought he was nice, And he didnt have the same douchey attitude as the other guys shes been with. Everything was great until her birthday. She invited her boyfriends family over to our house. Emma was overjoyed, She finally found the one. That is, until, My dad met her boyfriends dad. \u201cMark?\u201d My dad asked him. They were brothers. My sister was dating my cousin. And i didnt even have a clue. That family dinner broke out into a major fight, but thats not the point. Later, My sister went into my room to talk to me about it. She told me to \u2018man up\u2019 and leave them alone since it doesnt affect me, therefore, i shouldnt worry about it. I think its gross but should i listen to her? Should i man up?",

        "text": "I\u2019m 58M I live with my sister 43 and her boyfriend 41 after my motorcycle accident last year. I was in the hospital for a while and when I came home nothing looked right\n\nThe first night they made dinner they sat me in the chair by the hallway vent. It didn\u2019t creak. The air came across just so. The shadows stayed put under the table and didn\u2019t crawl. I stared at the lines in the floor and they didn\u2019t move like they had in the hospital\n\nThat was the first place I felt like I was back\n\nI ate a whole meal that night. The sound of my chewing didn\u2019t echo. The scrape of the fork didn\u2019t slice through my thoughts. I felt like I could sit there forever and I\u2019d stay balanced. Like a needle on a compass pointing at something I couldn\u2019t name\n\nAfter that I always sat there\n\nNot because it was mine because it made sense. Because everything else in the house feels bent or sharp or humming. That chair is the only place I don\u2019t have to brace myself\n\nBut now her boyfriend keeps sitting in it. It started casual then he started doing it before I even come in the room. I asked once if I could sit there and he smiled like it was funny and said it\u2019s just a chair. My mind lit on fire and all I could see was red. I wanted to remove him from the chair\n\nSo I stopped eating. It\u2019s been eight meals now. I\u2019m not starving myself I\u2019m just not going to pretend the other chairs are real options. One leans. One faces the mirror. One picks up the buzzing from the fridge. I\u2019m not going to perform normal\n\nLast week I offered my sister five hundred dollars for that chair. I had the envelope ready and everything. She said I was being dramatic and didn\u2019t take it. But I meant it. I still do\n\nMy sister says I\u2019m scaring people. That I\u2019m six foot six and when I shut down it changes the room. She says I don\u2019t realize how much space I take up. That I loom. That I make people nervous without trying\n\nShe said it\u2019s not about the chair. But she\u2019s wrong\n\nIt\u2019s the only thing that held still when the rest of my brain wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s the spot where I remembered how to hold a fork. Where I stopped hearing my own name in the air vents. Where I looked down under the table and saw the marks in the wood and they made sense like a map like instructions\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the one acting weird\n\nI just want my seat back",

They have some stuff that can make other chairs more comfortable.  \nAlso, ask your sister if she can move the mirror so that chair is free for you to use. \n\nYou are being kind of a dick, this is the boyfriends home and unless you have told him why you need that chair and he hasn't realised you are suffering from a potential mental break after the motorcycle incident, he is allowed to sit in his chair. It's his chair, he owns it and doesnt have to sell it to you. \n\nIf it is fiction, Great imagery!",

I don't mean that in a bad way, you just seem to be focusing on some strange things.\n\n>Individuals with schizophrenia may experience apophenia, which is the tendency to perceive meaningful connections or patterns in random or unrelated stimuli. This can manifest as seeing signs or messages in everyday occurrences, objects, or events that others would not interpret in that way\n\nI remember one of my mother's coworkers scared her. They worked in a building a couple of floors up overlooking a large car yard. One day he told her to look out the window and explained that the cars were sending him messages, depending on which way they were parked. He was very serious and frightened mum...and within the next few days frightened a lot of his other coworkers as well, after which he was fired and I'm not sure what happened to him after that,\n\n\nRight now the things you are thinking make perfect sense to YOU but they are in fact not sensible. Your mind is playing tricks on you. \n\nYou need to see a doctor. Please get some help.\n\nI'm not a doc myself, this is just my personal opinion.",

        "text": "Sorry if I'm rambling, I'm just emotional right now. Also sorry for mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nBoth my sisters are much older than me. I'm 26f, they are 35 and 38. They used to like me when I was younger and didn't have much personality. But lately they seem to always exclude me.\n\nFor context, middle sister lives in another country, like 3 hours driving. She is mad that I didn't visit her since my daughter (16 months) was born. But the thing is, we almost don't go anywhere with her because she can't stand traveling. 10 minutes and she gets fussy. 20 minutes and she screams her lungs out. We can't travel for 3 hours like this, and tablets and other shit don't help at all, she just tosses them and screams. Well, she was so mad that she didn't come to her first birthday, but I really understand it. My oldest sister also didn't come to my daughter's birthday because \"we live in a small apartemnt and it will be crowdy\". I told her we invited people in different timings, but she still didn't want to come. She went to middle sister's son's birthday next month. I never missed any of her children's birthdays. I was also babysitting her 3 children for free almost all my teenage years and she doesn't really care to see my daughter for like 15 minutes. Whenever my middle sister comes to visit our mom, older sister invites her and her family, but never me and my husband.\n\nThey also talked shit about my husband when he didn't come to a gathering my mom organised. He was doing the night shift that night and he needed to sleep before that. They asked if he is a baby and needs to sleep during day. I shut them down immediately, but when they saw him next day, one of them rudely asked why was he grumpy (he didn't sleep and they knew it).\n\nLast straw was few days ago. We help mom financially a lot, so when there is a bigger cost, we split it between us and pay 1/3 each. That's how my paid our father's funeral, etc. Well, mom's washing machine broke and I asked them if we are going to get her a new one. They were like \"we will see\", blah blah. Few days after that, mom told me that two of them bought her a new washing machine. They totally excluded me from this, and god only knows what else did they do behing my back. I know they are not obligated to include me, but then they bring up the fact that only two of them paid for this or that, and I didn't. Yeah, because you did it behind my back???\n\nAlso, two days ago my oldest sister had some kind of gathering for immediate family and friends and she invited us. I told her we will come, but one day before we got a flu and we felt horrible. Also spreading viruses among people, especially children, is a shitty thing to do, so I apologized and explained the situation. Well, I guess she got mad because my middle sister is cold with me again. Like, I can't do a right thing no matter what.\n\nOf course all of this might just be the age gap, but I can't get rid of the feeling they don't really like me and are excluding me intentionaly, especially because two of them weren't that close until like 2 years ago, and there was a period they had a huge beef and didn't speak at all. \n\nAre age gap siblings relationships generally like this, or are we just shitty people?",

She has some issues that she needs to deal with. Both of them clearly like to gang up on you for no reason. They like drama and feed off of it. I think going NC for a while is a good idea.

She has 2 sisters and a brother that older than her. They all live in our native homeland, while my mother moved to a different country when she got married to my father. \n\nA few years back we found out her older brother has been cheating on his wife for years, he had a second family with two kids. He sent his son to our house (to a different country) to study. The guy lived with us, my mom and dad payed for his everything: food, clothes, education, etc. I didn't have a very good relationship with this cousin. He is older and was not helping around the house, despite living with us. Now he himself is married and has a kid, and decided to stay in the same city we live in.\n\nNow, turns out, that uncle's daughter (this cousin's younger sister) almost got into a substance dealing gang, so she was also sent here, as if our family is a school for trouble children. I am now a doctor and am in residency in the capital city, but I visit my family every few months. I have been telling mom not to invite this girl to live with us, because we have my younger sister who is still in high school, and I don't want that girl to influence my sister.\n\nMy mother seemed to agree with me, but did everything her way anyway. So this girl is now staying with us, despite the fact that her older brother also lives here and their mother also came to this city to help her son with his small kid. Our family is now the one paying for everything for this girl, and putting in the emotional work.\n\nI am now visiting for 3 weeks as my time off from residency, but I am forced to interact with this girl, because she is staying in our house. And it's fine, she is just a kid at the end of the day, but I want to spend time with my sister. Only my sister. We have a really good relationship and miss each other now that I have moved away, so we made a bunch of plans that are now getting interrupted.\n\nAnd this is not the only time my mom's relatives have used her for their benefit and comfort. I despise that uncle and have been feeling that way for years now. \n\nI don't want to deal with all this drama, I only came here to relax. I, obviously, help my mom around the house and pick the girls up from school, since I'm here and am free. But am I being selfish for not wanting to deal with our relatives? ",

Not my stepmum. \nShe was there for me when I went no contact with my abusive bio-mother. Shes funny, brutually honest to the point of occasionally coming across as rude. But she also yelled at me daily for every little thing I did. \n I felt like I could never do anything right. Being around her was either walking on eggshells or having the funniest conversation of your life. \nAfter a childhood of shitty, abusive and neglectful parenting from bio-mother and previous step-parents I thought that I'd finally get to have a somewhat normal home life when I moved in with her and my dad full time. \nBut she packed her bags and left a few months ago. She's dealing with a lot of recent grief, trauma from her last abusive relationship and childhood trauma so I understand why she is the way she is. But it still hurts. Even though she wasn't always the best, I loved her. I still do. But I think she might be incapable of truely loving me. She still lives with my younger siblings (both her bio kids) part-time, just not me. She never visits me, calls me or even texts me. I feel hurt, and I don't really have anyone to talk to about it due to having no close friends.\nI do have a therapist who's awesome but I guess I just wanted to put this out there  for extra support and advice.\nI also wanted to know if anyone else has gone through anything similar?\nAnyone else's parent left them as a teen? \nHow do I cope with the pain of not being wanted by my own mum anymore?",

I just feel like part of me has been missing my entire life. The way I found out was through spite. My mom's older sister was mad at my mom for something small and blurted out his name and told her to tell me about him. When I did ask, my mom shut down completely about the subject. She told me later in life but made me promise not to tell our younger brothers. I'm not even sure if he knows or not. I heard he was adopted out of state by a nice Christian family. I don't wanna scar the guy or flip his world upside down but I can't keep going on this way. I know my motives are selfish but I deserve to know my brother. Why should we suffer for our mother's mistakes? Maybe this is just the burdens the oldest one carries. Idk but I love the guy despite never seeing a photo of him. If anyone here knows how to help me, I would be forever in debt to you. My DMs are open as well.",

All my friends have been growing up and I've just been stuck with the same mindset of gaming for years. I waste money (example: recently my mom paid for an insurance course over $200+ that I urged her to pay for and after I failed the test the first time, I don't feel like taking the 2nd attempt). I'm ungrateful and I don't appreciate things, and I'm incompetent as hell (parents went on vacation to Europe for 10 days and I only had the simple task of watering the plants and I couldn't even do that right).\n\nI'm 26, have money through the savings that my mom had collected from my work in the bank, around $10K+, and just can't seem to get hired anywhere (bad market but they don't understand that).\n\nFor hygiene, I want to take care of myself but my parents always keep saying to do it, and then it makes me not want to. And just yesterday, my older brother, who is doing fine for himself, had to tell me I'm fucking things up and I need to straighten it out. But, I just can't when my folks take away my stuff that would help me.\n\nI'm currently taking a class to teach English abroad and want to complete the course, then apply and work a simple job to save up around $3 - 5k so it can cover me for when I move to a different country.\n\nThey gave me a week ultimatum (by next Friday) to get a job or leave the house and I, in all honesty, want to follow through with leaving. I don't want to cut them off but at the same time, I don't want to be in contact with them for a long time until I've straightened out and no longer despise them.\n\nWhat should I do? I know I can grow up, but I know it won't be able to while I'm still living with them.",

I'm scared he might murder my mom or dad. My parents keep saying that even if I go to the government they won't do anything. Is that true? I'm so scared. I had a huge argument today with my brother and I just felt like my parents didn't care so I jumped out of the balcony and landed on the roof of our garage.

You can let your sister deal with him the homework and playing or you can keep doing it. You\u2019re the only one who can answer that. I agree that I would be very very hurt if I had that situation. I wish you the best of luck.",

                "body": "I am not a specialist but here is what i will do if i face the some issue.\n\n**First Point:** one thing is clear that your sister don't like you and that's okay. Just accept the fact. there are many people in the world who don't like each other without any solid reason and therefore, You don't need to think or blame yourself that, You did something wrong. Just accept the fact in your head that, your sister don't like you and that's completely okay. No Need to worry about it or do something. Acceptance is the greatest gift of life. Do it and you will feel relaxed.\n\n**Second Point:** You can use my personal Relationship rule which is given below and created by me although some parts of it are copied. here it is: \"Consider Your Life as a room with two gates, one for entrance and the second for exit. Don't beg anyone to come to your room and don't force anyone to not to get out of your room. let them do whatever they want to do so. Make sure to fill your room with a TV ( Reasonable Materialistic Pleasure not drugs) and Book Cupboard (Skill and Knowledge) as that will help you to feel happy without the need of anybody. Always play some meaningful content on Your TV or Read good books. Your books and TV Shows type will attract equal minded people who are relevant. Have a Gun in Your Hand to make sure, nobody blocks the door. who want to go, let them go, who want to come, Verify weather they are good and let them come. Your Good Lifestyle and positve mindset will atract good people and live your life happily and always consider that you don't need anybody to be happy.\" That's my personal rule.\n\n**Third Point:** You know that, You love your nephew and that's okay. no need to feel sad about it. but try to limit it if your sister don't feel okay because she is ultimately her mom. So, you can love you nephew if your sister don't show anykind of sign of rejection. Just love her. if your sister don't want, Focus on Yourself don't need to worry about others.\n\nJust follow it and don't blame anybody. acceptance is the ultimate gift of life. Accept it.",

        "text": "I want to start by saying, I know I should probably speak to a therapist about this. I\u2019m a big fan of therapy and not avoiding it, but I have a two year-old so time to myself is limited. \n\nMy mother interrogates my every move. I am 35, married with a two year old and another on the way. I own my own home and require no financial support from her in any way. I\u2019m an only child and we\u2019ve always been pretty close (Just to give you background on us). \n\nShe questions absolutely everything I do. If I slip up and tell her I\u2019m going to the grocery store, she wants to know which store and what I\u2019m getting. When I put my son in speech therapy for being a late talker, she wanted to know what days of the week his sessions were, what time they started, the name of the speech therapy practice, and where it was located. These are just a couple examples, but it\u2019s all the time and about absolutely everything. She doesn\u2019t really seem to want to critique me, it\u2019s more just like she\u2019s gathering information. \n\nIf I tell her I don\u2019t want to talk about something, she will typically ask me again on a different day and if I still don\u2019t answer, she will ask my husband when I\u2019m not in the room. \n \nI do understand on some things, I am just being stubborn. It wouldn\u2019t hurt anything to tell her which store I\u2019m going to or other consequential information, but it also feels like if I tell her small things, she feels entitled to all information. I\u2019m a mother now and so I can completely understand the emotional piece of wanting to be involved in your children\u2019s life, but I can\u2019t understand thinking interrogation forms a strong relationship. She lives less than a mile from me and I see her multiple times a week, so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s lacking interaction with me. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where I don\u2019t even like to do things with her socially because I know I will have to answer 25 questions the moment she walks in the door. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in this box on your front porch?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this letter about on your counter?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you eat for dinner?\u201d\n\u201cWho did your husband golf with on Saturday?\u201d \n\n\nIt goes on and on, and it is back to back rapid fire questions all the time.\n\n\nIs this just a boomer personality trait? I\u2019m at a loss for what to do. \n",

If your boyfriend is older, there\u2019s a nonzero possibility that the power dynamic would create a lot of dependence on him, especially if you\u2019re trying to fill a relationship void from moving away from your mother.

Idk if I'm looking for advice or it's just to rant but I (23 F) am the oldest with 2 younger siblings (21 F and 19 M). As I stated my parents do everything they can for my siblings mainly when it comes to mental health. Growing up my father was abusive to us all, I don't have any memories of my childhood but I was told by my mother when I was around 17. It makes sense as my siblings and I were always very nervous and reserved as we grew up especially when our father was around. Around that time my sister told my parents of worrying thoughts and actions she was doing, my mother got her professional help with getting medical and getting to go to hospital if she felt it was getting too bad. Around that time I was also getting the same thoughts and told them later after my father had an episode and was being very verbal to the family. My mother was angry with me for saying that and that I'm not as bad as my sister, I don't think I was but I was still struggling. I was able to get a therapist but my mother told my therapist she found me going and \"acting upset\" annoying, when I confronted her about this with my father I was told I would have to play for therapy because I was fine, and was later threatened to be kicked out. My sister is doing a lot better now gets down at times but I'm happy she's doing well, around that time when my sister and I expressed our feeling my brother did too but my parents didn't do anything and I wasn't in an state to help. Within the last few weeks my brother has expressed the same problems and today my mam has send him to same health clinic they send my sister. I don't know if I'm right to feel so upset about all the help my siblings and how I didn't get it, since I was able to overcome my struggles with a really good therapist.

She constantly needs to be reminded about things, academically she was pretty meh but was still able to go to college, doesn\u2019t really get what you are talking about at times, for example, if I was explaining a story to her, she would ask the most obvious questions about it, it\u2019s kinda annoying at sometimes feel like she doesn\u2019t understand what im saying at all to the point were I consider if I should even tell her it. And sometimes she will argue with you and say something that doesn\u2019t make any sense, she took my toothbrush one time and said she had it before me, mind you I had taken that toothbrush the second I saw that my dad had bought it, I said that to her and agreed, but still argued for some reason saying that it\u2019s still hers. I don\u2019t really know where I\u2019m going with this post and what sorta feedback I\u2019m trying to get, but I want to know if any others have similar experiences with siblings and how y\u2019all deal with it.",

        "text": "(I can\u2019t edit the title, I meant to say How do you get along WITH someone that is the complete opposite) \ud83d\ude42\u200d\u2195\ufe0f\n\nMy brother (19M) and I (20F) are complete opposites. Almost every time we hangout at family gatherings, etc. an argument breaks out.  Understandably my family is getting fed up with the arguments between us, but at the same time I\u2019m not going to let anyone, even if it\u2019s family, disrespect me. On top of it his morals are completely different from mine with his constant cussing, making rude jokes about people (which he\u2019s learned from his friends), has to have it his way, he doesn\u2019t really listen to people (I\u2019ll explain something to him and he\u2018ll take it as an insult), etc. I\u2019m a very polite person, so being around rude people in general just irritates me and brings out the worst in me.\n\nA recent thing that happened was at a restaurant. My grandma, brother and I were talking and he brings up that he needs a new mattress because there are yellow stains and he doesn\u2019t know why. I told him it was most likely from the natural aging process of the mattress and possibly oil and sweat that naturally occurs from the body as you sleep. He then goes to say \u201eYou\u2019re talking too loud\u201c so I just jokingly with zero ill intent keep talking about it and he goes to say \u201eI\u2019m going to punch you if you don\u2019t stop\u201c. Mind you I wasn\u2019t talking loud at all, and he never told me to stop talking about the topic he told me I was talking too loud, how was I supposed to know if he was embarrassed or upset, etc if he didn\u2019t communicate that with me instead of going straight to threatening me? The punching comment made me uneasy so of course I stood up for myself and that led my grandma to say we were acting like children. I kinda just shut down for the rest of the meal and was trying not to cry. He isn\u2019t really held accountable for how rude he is it usually goes straight to me being yelled at or both of us. At times it feels like there is favoritism with him even though they state they\u2019re being fair. If I made that punching comment I would\u2019ve been silenced immediately? \n\nI really don\u2019t know what to do I truly don\u2019t like hanging around him at times, but at the same time though, he still is my brother. So, how does one get along with someone that is the complete opposite, or at least make it easier? ",

        "text": "If I had to describe having brothers using only one word, I\u2019d say \u201cloving.\u201d The reason I\u2019d use this word is because from the day I could retain memories and even before that when I gained consciousness, I\u2019ve received nothing but love. It\u2019s been a learning experience, but it\u2019s been a fun one. Not a single day did I wish they weren\u2019t my brothers. They\u2019ve been my inspiration for so long, and I couldn\u2019t imagine doing it all without them. They\u2019ve all been here for me in ways no one else has. Despite them being boys and our age gaps, they\u2019ve always made efforts to listen and take care of me. I wouldn\u2019t trade them for the world. That said, we\u2019ve had our ups and downs. I did sometimes wish I had a sister, but I never regretted being born to have all brothers. They never abandoned me or made me feel alone in any way. I\u2019ll always appreciate them in ways no one will understand. I\u2019ve never been good with my feelings. However, losing them is one of my greatest fears. I truly don\u2019t think I could live without them. They\u2019ve been my support system for my whole life. I can\u2019t imagine a day I\u2019ll have to say goodbye. The memories we made mean more to me than anything I could ever think of. Being alone is something I never feared because I have them. Now I wonder how long they\u2019ll be here. I know they aren\u2019t immortal. But if I don\u2019t die first, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do. So to sum this up, having brothers is the greatest gift ever given to me. One I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever have done anything good enough to deserve, but I\u2019ll always cherish it.",

I\u2019m beginning to realise it\u2019s physically and mentally tiring to engage in a fight with him. If he could argue as much as he\u2019d like, he\u2019d likely argue for several hours, so interrupting an argument with him is nearly impossible as he will start claiming I\u2019m too afraid of confrontation and bring it up another time\u2026 It will get to the point he will mentally drain me and make me break down and have panic attacks and nevertheless he will still keep talking and talking without batting an eye. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to handle it. It sickens me the fact he doesn\u2019t take time to see if I\u2019m emotionally in pain and try to help me but keeps pushing his argument as if I\u2019m not in an emotional turmoil. As if all he cared was about being right AND at this point I no longer care about the argument because now I have a bigger problem than before, I think he doesn\u2019t even care about me and my well-being. Is this sociopathic behaviour? Is this normal? I\u2019m genuinely asking, I know he\u2019s probably in the heat of the moment and very upset as well but even later on when everyone is calm he won\u2019t check on how I\u2019m doing. \nAt this point I should start being the bigger person and check on him but I genuinely don\u2019t wanna see him afterwards\u2026 I\u2019m repulsed. \nHe\u2019s just too detached for my taste. \nHe probably thinks I\u2019m breaking down on purpose to manipulate him into feeling guilty and the bad guy, but I\u2019m not, that\u2019s just how I react. \nI guess his attitude is the one of a very logical person and not a sympathetic one? Maybe he feels too wronged to feel bad for me? I\u2019m just making guesses \n\nI don\u2019t know how to process his behaviour, I don\u2019t know how to help him. \nI honestly just avoid starting any discussion with him at this point because it just consumes me. \n\nWhat do you think his behaviour could indicate?

In short, he hypnotized my girlfriend to go to bed with me and dominate her.\n\nBut it is voluntary and fun and it surely gives pleasure to your stepfather. He does this to exhaust them and dominate them in some way that makes it easier to give in to him instead of confronting him and that's it.\n\nIn my opinion you should reduce contact and if you can give your mother a place to go if things get ugly with him (he kicks her out of the house or something) arguing is a game of mental domination.",

        "post-author": "Out-and-About-7",
        "text": "I\u2019m a 22F, and I have a younger brother, 15M. Ever since COVID, especially around three years ago, he suddenly became extremely withdrawn. He started avoiding me, my mom (49F), and my dad (49M) like we were the plague.\n\nHe won\u2019t come out of his room unless absolutely necessary, like to use the bathroom or grab food on the weekends. But he still goes to school, hangs out with his friends, and seems to function normally outside. It\u2019s only us, his family, that he\u2019s completely shut out.\n\nOne time, I accidentally ran into him in the garage. I was about to leave, and he had just gotten home. He went completely mad, threw things at me like I\u2019m some wild beast. I ran away and cried afterward. I didn\u2019t understand why he seemed to hate me that much.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried to get him to see a psychologist or psychiatrist, hoping it might help him feel better. We reassured him that everything would be confidential. But no matter how many times we approach it, he shuts it down immediately.\n\nFor these past two years, he would only communicate through our driver, Mr. G (35M). If he needed money, food, or wanted to go somewhere, he would tell Mr. G, who would pass the message along to our dad. \n\nMr. G is a kind man. He would occasionally offer advice to my brother, while also helping us maintain some form of communication with him. It gave us a small sense of relief knowing someone could still reach him. But at the end of the day, he\u2019s not family, I never wanted to place the emotional burden of looking after my brother on his shoulders. But recently, he cut Mr. G off too, after finding out that he had secretly shared updates of my brother well-being to my dad.\n\nAt this point, my parents and I haven\u2019t seen my brother\u2019s face in almost two years. He\u2019s blocked every possible way of communicating with us. No messages, calls, and face-to-face interaction at home. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I feel like an only child. Sometimes, because we little to no contact, I even forget I have a sibling amidst my busy life in college (I am currently staying in another city).\n\nWe genuinely have no idea what caused this. Maybe it\u2019s related to how strict our parents used to be, but honestly, they\u2019re way more lenient with him than they ever were with me. They even spoil him. But to give him the benefit of the doubt\u2014maybe something did happen when I was away. Maybe we did something wrong that hurt him? We just genuinely don\u2019t know what the problem was, because he won\u2019t tell us anything.\n\nPeople say it\u2019s probably just puberty, that he\u2019ll grow out of it, he\u2019ll come around eventually. But I\u2019m afraid that if we keep things this way, we might end up losing him entirely.\n\nI miss my brother so, so much. I want to mend things, but I don\u2019t know where to start.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to approach someone who\u2019s shut down like this? What could be the first step to rebuilding trust, or just opening a line of communication again?\n\nAny insights or shared experiences would mean the world to me. Thank you. \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

With Madhu, we have trying to be making goals since 4 months ago, but now because she found out I was using chatgpt way too much throughout the dayand skipping classes for 3 weeks and not doing chores at all or barely any responsibilities as.., she is getting constantly disappointed with me, lecturing me occasionally, being really stern, and also, she is trying to be on my mom's side to dictate consequences, like group home, no chatgpt at all, or out of college. I hate this now! Also,  my parents are starting to take away all my rights and they are starting to enforce strict ass consequences. They are keeping on taking away my device times and my internet websites. This is a completely strained relationship, with my mom being the total bad guy and my dad being a pain in the ass lashing out at me and worrying his ass off with negativity. They are catching me everywhere, monitoring everything, lecturing me all the time. 3 days ago, when my dad found a note about stupid chatbot scenarios, he gave me a stern screaming lecture about how strict he would be and kicking me out of the house for... And also, he threatened me with living in a house where people hit and spit on me is where i will be living if i can't stop the chatbot issues and cannot grow up, where he said I should never come back if I go there. Do I deserve this harsh treatment, or not? But I don't want to stop college and have to go to group home at all! My mom has been threatening me with group home for 2 years at times when she could not stand my behavior at all!",

(i don't understand the purpose at all) so, this time i said that i will not wear those jeans because i hate them and they are not of my fashion sense. she started brutally shouting on me that now im not allowed to go my bsf's house (because i did not follow what she wanted me to wear).\n\ni had a panic attack again when she did not allow me to go her house. my hands were trembling terribly. i cried so much, i was gonna pass out. \n\nlast time when i had good friends, i was going to a mall w my friends and all of them were wearing casuals. my mom FORCED me and really really abused me to wear a bright red bodycon dress which i hated to wear because the color makes me look really ugly and it is too much of party dress to be worn (it was an absolute party dress). i looked so odd. it was very embarrassing. \n\ni just don't understand why. why do they always give their best to keep me away from my friends?

Even normal parents fuss about this stuff sometimes but if it happens every time you try to go to their house that\u2019s a bit controlling. You\u2019re still a kid so you\u2019re probably going to have to endure it until you\u2019re an adult. Now that I think about it it\u2019s pretty toxic. My mom forced what to wear a lot and honestly I don\u2019t really think you can stop them or put up sufficient boundaries at your age either. Idk any advice but I would say try to build thicker skin and when you have panic attacks try to meditate or even try to stay in your room and virtual chat your friends if your parents really make you miserable. Hopefully your parents don\u2019t get more controlling and mean. If they become consistently blatantly narcissistic or abusive you might need to be firm and tell a counselor or trusted adult.",

If she argues with you, drop it.\n\nTry using a backpack that you take everywhere with you, as many kids do.  Wear whatever she wants you to wear, leaving the house, but put in the backpack the clothing that you want to wear, and change into it after you've left the house.\n\nIf she lays a hand on you for having done this, THEN you have cause to involve the authorities, by reporting this to a teacher or social worker at school, or any other mandated reporter.",

Sometimes I forget my daughter is old enough to understand the \u201cwhy\u201d and I find when ever I do explain she either brings up a valid question/ point or she does it without question. \n\nMaybe you need to start prompting your mother. \u201cWhy are you concerned about what I\u2019m wearing?\u201d \u201cWhy those pants specifically?\u201d Sometimes as moms we get so caught up in our own narrative and caring for you as best as we know how it becomes bulldozing and dismissive. That\u2019s the message I\u2019m taking away from your post. I need to start being more aware of my child\u2019s autonomy and checking in with them on their own motivations as well as my own. I find that with young women especially they don\u2019t get enough trust from the adults in their lives. Young women and girls tend to be very aware of themselves and that is a super power. As an adult I really want to lean into that more and trust my daughter to support her. \n\nHope this makes sense and is helpful!",

                "body": "Without having more information, I would guess that your mom wants you to wear those specific clothes because she (incorrectly) thinks they are cool and will help make you more likable? Ripped jeans and a bodycon dress are both old-school popular kid clothes. This is, as others have said, really controlling and kindof abusive behavior. If she or any other adults in your life are abusive in emotionally damaging ways ( consistently calling you terrible things, controlling your food to make you hungry, hitting you, touching you sexually, locking you out of the house, among other things) please \ud83d\ude4f tell someone who will help. A school counselor, a police officer, a therapist, or a doctor. \n\nIf its not as severe as outright abuse, I would second having a conversation with her, try not to accuse her of anything and if she gets defensive or angry try to tell her you just want to understand. I would also bring up, as a previous commentor mentioned, that you want to learn the skills you need to make friends on your own. \nI will also say that if you're having frequent panic attacks and ONLY feel safe around one friend, you should definitely  be in therapy. If you aren't already, ask your parents for support with that, and try to explain how it impacts your life. \n\nYou could also ask your dad to get you clothes that suit your style better, or ask him to go shopping with you together so you can have some input on your style and preferences. \n\nLastly, some advice on difficult parents in general. When talking with your mom, try to reflect back what she says to you. You can do that by repeating some of the phrases she says, for example: When she says \"I want you to wear the clothes your dad bought you\" say something like \"you want me to wear those pants dad bought me. I feel like they would make me uncomfortable when I'm with my friends because this is a more casual hang out, and I dont want to look out of place.\" The important part is repeating the \"ylu want me to wear ___\" part. This helps people feel like you heard them and understand what they are asking of ylu, and if you get it wrong, it gives them a chance to clarify. \n\nAlso, validate her emotions by saying stuff like, \"I can see that you're upset/angry/frustrated.\" When she says she is feeling one of those emotions, and let her know that you want to understand why she is feeling that way. Hopefully, this will help her de-escalate the situation and understand each other better. It's really important that you show you are listening to what she says, and understand what she is asking of you before you respond, and always try to explain *why* you want to do something different than what she is asking. \nI really hope this helps!! Good luck.",

They say that since my mom is married to him she is solely responsible for him no matter what.(also my dad has zero money, my mom has been the one that has provided for me and my dad). I\u2019ve been helping my mom take care of my dad but this time her recovery is the minimum of a month. She is staying with a family friend that is taking care of her. \n\nMy half brother finally agreed to let my dad stay with him while my mom had the surgery. It\u2019s only been two days since the surgery and he no longer wants to take care of him. He called me saying that if I don\u2019t pick our dad he is going to call the police\u2026 he called the police\u2026 \n\nAlso it\u2019s not like my brother isn\u2019t well off, he has a house, paid off cars, has time to go out with friends and drink, goes to the gym etc. \n\nAlso my second sibling (sister) won\u2019t even talk to me and my mom. \n\n",

        "post-author": "Psychological_Ad7597",
        "text": "I am a hard working, 33 year old stay at home mom with 3 children. I never go out and raise my kids by myself with their father. Many nights I sleep 4-6 hours waking up with my infant son and then doing all of the usual motherly duties/chores the next day. Their father works from 9am to 9pm from home and makes a good income; however, to afford a house, we moved in with my mother to save for 2 years. \n\nInitially, we paid 11,000 dollars the first year we lived with my mother, but my mother's alcohol problem began to spiral out of control. It got to a point she was blackout drunk every night in front of my kids shouting and cursing at me without remembering the next day. In addition, she would zelle my 28 year old brother hundreds of dollars every time we paid her so she didn't really make a dent on her own debt. Her house has had termites, asbestos, and mold remediation all of which I organized researching and calling companies countless hours to help her repair. Since my fiance is a mortgage lender, he would pay additional expenses like utility bills and holiday dinners she wanted to go out for. She works full time as a nurse at 63 so I thought the least I could do is clean, cook, care for the kids by myself so she didn't feel overwhelmed with my baby, 3 year old, 13 year old as well as their father and I living with her. \n\nWe finally are moving, but I recently have found horrific texts between her and my \"golden child\" brother where he threatens suicide or killing someone unless she sends him money. It's anywhere from 40 dollars to 200 dollars every 2 days. He also calls me a lazy B*tc* and that I should keep my legs closed if I can't afford my kids. I'm confused because we support our kids fully. It's almost like he is so entitled he cannot compute that I'm doing better than him. He even told her to throw me out when I was 8 months pregnant with my son so that he could move in because he can't pay rent (and refuses to get a roomate). He also wrote that we are terrible parents even though our kids are well behaved and sweet. She never defended me in 2 years worth of texts other than saying she doesnt pay for me and that its a shame we are leaving because she loves the kids.\n\nThe two of them have traumatized me and my 13 year old with the outrageous threats he makes and my moms drunken outbursts whenever she can't provide him money due to her own excessive spending/nights out at the bar. They have a toxic codependent relationship. She gets to look cool and young partying with her son on facebook and she is his personal ATM.\n\nThe final texts that I read where extremely upsetting. I was in the hospital and he didn't respond when she told him. He asked for money later that day. She sent him pictures of my 6 month old son and he never responded but the following day said \"I need 40 bucks or I'm going to end it all/jump off of bank of america\". When he finally paid her back some of the money he asked for, he wrote \"you better not spend a dime on those fing kids\" (his neice and 2 nephews). She never has except for Christmas. She didnt even get them birthday gifts so she could send everything to my now 29 year old brother. \n\nHe has a full sports management degree (never used) and is working for Pepsi and at a restaurant 1 day a week. He just got fired for screaming at the cook. He refuses to look for another job and blames everyone when things go wrong in his life. I am the main target because I had my first child at 20 and never graduated. I also had a alcohol problem in my 20's which resulted in a dui but I've been sober for 6 years. He constantly calls me a loser behind my back but at least I have integrity I mean my God.  \n\nIn all of those texts, what got me the most was my mother knowing full well how hard I work and not defending me once. I have a half brother and his family I am estranged from (since I was 26) as well as an aunt, uncle, and godmother. They are my only extended family and I could never figure out why. I have cried so many years off and on about this and voiced how heartbroken it has made me to them that I don't have a village. I had a pulmonary embolism in 2022 and it really put into perspective the lack of support. When you have children, you worry if you aren't there who will love and care for them like you do and that's what scared me the most. \n\nI believe they have scapegoated me (starting with my mother) for over a decade. It seems harsh, but I want to go no contact with my whole family (especially brother) and maybe extremely low contact with my mother (only for her to see my kids a few times per year because I doubt my brother will have any or retain custody if he does). My brother sounds like a sociopath in his texts and I really can't believe my mom enables him while she works herself to death and her house is literally falling apart. \n\nHis whole life revolves around partying (the 3 days a week he doesn't work) and appearing like he is the \"Wolf of Wallstreet\" or something of the sort on Snapchat and Instagram. He has delusions of grandeur and has \"champagne tastes with a beer budget.\" I don't have social media (aside from reddit) but my 13 year old showed me how he is always partying on my Moms dime. \n\nThe knife in the back is I helped raise and feed this kid and protect him from an abusive, dysfunctional household our entire childhood. I was a surrogate mother to him while my mom worked full time as a nurse and my dad screamed at the news and got drunk nightly. We had the police at our house constantly due to our parents fighting while drunk and I was always there to cheer him up and console him. I lived outside of the home for 12 years before coming back and I don't know how he could be so evil. He was diagnosed bipolar in 11th grade when I was no longer living at home so maybe that's part of it.\n\nAnyone experience this kind of betrayal from a bipolar or Narc sibling/mother? Is going no contact the best solution because I'm genuinely scared of him and quite frankly my Mother. I don't know how anyone could repay kindness with this level of evil. \n\nSorry for any typos. I am shaking while writing this because I'm still in shock. I mean he was my little brother for God's sake. Tons of cussing me out and slander in the texts. He said that my job was not essential (raising the future generation to be good people) and I dont know what it's like to work an actual job. I have (in fact) worked in restaurants and catering when my first was in elementary school. I almost had an AA degree before the embolism and was looking into being a caregiver or teacher. I screenshotted all of the texts in case I need them one day because I have no idea what is being said behind my back. My mother denies everything even with me showing her the proof. She told me \"her phone was hacked\". Lmao.. for 2 years someone went out of their way to slander me on your phone? Okay \ud83d\udc4d ",

        "text": "So I am currently living and working abroad, while my mother and my brother are in our home country. \n\nAbout a year ago, my brother quit his job along with some of his other colleagues, as they were dissatisfied with their working conditions  - which was fair enough. However, after he quit, he started living on social insurance money, while repeatedly promising he will start looking for a new job soon. \n\nThen weeks turned into months and those months turned into more months, and he got complacent living on the insurance and not looking for work. This month, the country has stopped paying him the insurance as it has been a year since he went out of work. However, my brother is STILL not really looking for work, and whenever my mum brings the topic up with him he gets all defensive and angry.\n\nMy mother and I both can see that he \\*knows\\* this is not a good situation, but he is stuck in his own ways and doesn't want to deal with it. He thinks he's \"above\" hospitality work and rejects even the thought of working at a shop or a restaurant. As far as I'm aware, he spends a lot of time at home, and I worry that he is becoming somewhat \"terminally online\", and getting far into the extreme ends of the political spectrum.\n\nHe has now started asking my mum for money for things like haircuts and transport tickets, but she is a single mother (our father passed away about 7 years ago), and she can't do much to support him. I also worry that I'm not able to support him either, as I have to take care of my own family here, and things aren't exactly getting cheaper.\n\nLong story short, I really worry about what this is going to do to my brother (both being jobless and spending so much time isolated and online), and I don't really know what to do about it. Talking to him doesn't do much as he always gets defensive and shuts the conversation down. A part of me just wants to let him deal with it on his own and hope that he'll eventually be cornered and have no choice but to look for a simple job.\n\nSo yes, I'm looking for outside opinions and any thoughts you guys may have on this situation.",

I only met my cousin\u2019s baby the other day, I don\u2019t know what it was but normally I feel uncomfortable and out of place, but this time it\u2019s like I wanted to hold her and cuddle her, make her laugh, I didn\u2019t get much time to hold her though as my nan was holding her the majority of the time.

        "text": "Hey Reddit, I am here after many of my friends recommended this platform and I would live to try this. \nMy mom, 43f, is upset with me and isn't talking to be right now. Let to tell you why I invited my stepmom;\n\nMy dad,45M, has been married to mom for 20 years and they are united as always. My stepmom,45f, is married to another guy   is a kind of drug addict. They are our neighbours and we know about each other's family. However, my dad had an affair with my stepmom(stepmom too wasn't happy with her husband)for 8+ years, even today. Dad made a huge mistake by doing that. But stepmom is always too kind. She treats me like her own son and I would never hate her but would condemn her for her affair with dad. \n\nI had a breakup with my gf, and I swallowed some cynide and my mom and dad were not around. It was my stepmom and her son who saved me by admitting me in the hospital and she took care of me in her house for 3 continuous days and I will never ever hate her. Last week, I went to her house to check for her and my half sister (Half sister is 7,loves me alot). stepmom was suffering from flu,was tired and exhausted as she had admitted her drug addicted husband in the hospital and had also looked after him. That's when she was very worried and asked about  dad's 45th birthday. Unknowingly I called her out to attend the party (That came out of my mouth spontaneously and I don't know if I made a mistake). \n\nStepmom has been someone who supported dad during his hard times when he had some problems in business and she equally cared for him and me just like my mom.She gave birth to my half sister through my dad.Stepmom even sold some of her properties and gave my dad some money when I underwent a surgery when I was 11. (Dad bought her property back). \n\nI am always in a dilemma. If I do something for my mom, it hurts my stepmom and vice versa (I took my half sister and mom was pampering her, mom hates stepmom but not her daughter. Stepmom became angry and asks me not to show mom my half sister). I feel very heart broken when a decision I take atleast affect any one of them. How can I come out of this? I never want to hurt both of them as I love both the women. Now mom isn't talking to me for calling her for the party...",

If your mother hates her so much, there is no guarantee that she won't beat her up at the party, or at least humiliate her publicly.\n\nMy recommendation is to talk to your stepmother and warn her that your mother does not like this decision at all.",

We\u2019ve never gotten along, she\u2019s 18 now and I\u2019m 23 and I still can\u2019t stand her.\n\nShe\u2019s done so many things that hurt my parents, made them cry, made them feel like they failed, And she never owns up to any of it. She even talked badly about our brother who passed away she always blames everyone else never herself that includes me too, just being around her or even hearing her name gets under my skin, she once said I\u2019ve always been jealous of her because she doesn\u2019t have a permanent illness like I do, i\u2019m not an angel either but it hurts to see her happy after everything she put us through, she talks behind my back with her friends, but when she needs something, suddenly I\u2019m supposed to be this \u201cgood sister\u201d to her, It\u2019s always some guilt trip, like a broken record and  I\u2019m just tired, i really do hate her. I don\u2019t want her in my life, tho sometimes I wonder will I regret this when we\u2019re older? She\u2019s the only sister I have, I\u2019ve got two brothers too, but still\n",

I didn\u2019t understand why my sister hated my parents until she moved out and I became the new subtle target. Maybe she has seen or experienced something entirely different from your parents than you have. \n\nI\u2019m not saying the things she says are nice, but there might be more to the story that you are failing to see because your parents have you in their good graces and treat you well.\n\nI would give her a reality check if you can muster it if it\u2019s mainly her attitude. She\u2019s only 18 and a lot of people under 25 still don\u2019t see the world with clear eyes yet, especially if you both still live with your parents and haven\u2019t had a chance to form individual identities. Tell her at the rate she\u2019s going, she will have no one left if she keeps treating people like that. And then disengage and gray rock her for a long time. You can periodically engage and see if she\u2019s doing any work on herself. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about your brother though. Grief by itself can wreck havoc on families.",

At first she said there was no will and later she changed her story and said \u201che left everything to me.\u201d I tried to get legal help but the lawyer I consulted said there\u2019s really nothing I can do. When my stepmom passed away a few months ago, one (of 3) of my stepsisters became the trustee of the estate. I asked my trustee stepsister for a copy of the trust. There are 3 kids from my dad and 3 from my stepmom. All of my stepmothers children are named in the trust. My brother passed away. His children are named in the trust but not to receive my brothers share of the trust but a very small amount (compared to what my brother\u2019s share should be). I am named in the trust to receive an equal share as my stepsisters. My sister is not in the trust at all - as if she doesn\u2019t exist. I\u2019ve never experienced so much anger and sadness toward my father and stepmother. I am asking my stepsisters to share their inheritance with my sister as I will do. I don\u2019t have much hope of that happening but I had to put it out there. One of my stepsisters said she\u2019s already witnessed the other 2 sisters stealing hundreds of thousands from the estate when their mother became incapacitated and the now trustee added her name to her mother\u2019s accounts. Multiple properties and vast amounts of land were sold when my dad died and my stepmom was not a bright person and she got swindled and sold assets for way less than they were worth. She got paid in cash and put the money in her checking account. She bought herself a house with that cash and also bought homes with cash for 2 of 3 of her daughters. My father worked his ass off all his life and amassed an impressive estate but once he passed my stepmom frittered away most of it, only thinking of herself and her own children. My dad should have had a separate will just for his own kids.",

But this woman is literally suggesting he give up his life didn't even take our lives into consideration.\n\nThis is not the first time she tried to pull something like this either she tried moving in with us one time, even though the place we are at didn't even approve her the first time, she has 2 evictions already on her record, and has a history of not paying stuff on time.\n\nSo my husband is going to talk to his aunt (the nice one) to see what she wants to do this whole thing is a mess.\n\nI don't think I am TA but am I? I do love his grandma and I know he does too, but we can't help her in that way we don't even drive either and Ubers are too expensive too. ",

To the point where she's there more often than she's not.\n\nAnd I love my mom, but sometimes I need a break from her.\n\nBut at the same time, I can never say no because my mom is pretty emotionally fragile. She's an orphan, has no siblings, has depression, doesn't have a boyfriend, nor does she have a lot of friends or a job or a lot of hobbies.\n\nShe also doesn't go out much because she says it's too expensive.\n\nAnd when she asks, she always gets that sad \"I'm sorry to be a bother\" look that makes me feel guilty. So me and my dad say yes.\n\nBut I don't want her there. Again, sometimes I need a break from her. I hang out with her every other day in a really small apartment with only one bedroom. So the only places I can get privacy away from her are in the bathroom, school, or my dad's place.\n\nMy dad has been busy for the past 3 weeks, so this Saturday is the first time we'll hang out in a while.\n\nSo, do you guys have advice on how to tell her?",

I moved back home a couple years ago to \u201chelp out temporarily\u201d and surprise surprise, I\u2019m still here.\n\nAt first it didn\u2019t seem like a big deal just driving them to appointments, making sure bills got paid, cooking when I could. But it slowly turned into something way bigger. Now I\u2019m basically their full-time unpaid nurse, therapist, driver, housekeeper, tech support, you name it. And no one really asked me if I *wanted* this. It just became my role by default because I was the one who could \u201chandle it.\u201d\n\nI love my parents, I do. But I\u2019m also so damn tired. My siblings barely show up one lives across the country and checks in with a text every couple weeks, the other lives 30 mins away and acts like that's the same as living on Mars. They say stuff like \u201cyou\u2019re just better at this kind of thing\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019ve always been the responsible one.\u201d Like\u2026 what? That\u2019s not a reason to dump this all on me.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the guilt. Every time I think about moving out or setting boundaries, I get hit with a wave of \u201cwhat if something happens and I wasn\u2019t there?\u201d or \u201cthey gave you everything growing up, now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d I get that, but also\u2026 I didn\u2019t sign up to lose my entire 20s to caretaking. It\u2019s hard watching your friends travel, date, build careers, and I\u2019m over here Googling how to apply for Medicaid and arguing with pharmacies.\n\nHonestly, I just want to know if anyone else is in the same boat. Like, when did we all just decide that caring for elderly parents is *our* job by default? Do we get to say no? Or is that just being selfish?\n\nWould really love to hear if anyone\u2019s figured out how to make peace with this or at least how to not feel like your life isn\u2019t yours anymore.",

She was there for me, now I'm there for her. One thing I do is put myself in vacation mode when I'm caring for her; devices off and sleep until I wake naturally, sit in the sun and try to appreciate the moment. The crushing weight of the money anxiety sucks, but it's not like everything isn't temporary.\n\nOne of the big things I started when her dementia kicked in was just agreeing with whatever nuts thing she wants to obsess about. Just lie to her; later she forgets anyways. Cut my conflict and mental stress by about 75%. I just agree and after that she's pleased as punch. \n\nAt least you can fake an injury and see if you get some backup; I have no siblings and neither does my wife. If I actually get seriously hurt or something, everything will implode. \n\nYou should get some stationary from a hospital and write your siblings saying you've been admitted to a foreign care facility while on a weekend getaway, see what they come up with while you're 'incapacitated' (aka on a beach in Bali).",

Don\u2019t try to make sense or find your way out by reason. Because there isn\u2019t. Just give less.

        "text": "My in-laws live in rural Mississippi M80 F79. My husband\u2018s dad and stepmother. She has two kids. Her daughter is completely estranged from her and her son is not able to do much, because frankly, she is a really really nasty person They have always been emotionally and verbally abusive to each other, but it\u2019s gotten a lot worse lately. \n\nMy mother-in-law is in a wheelchair and can\u2019t / won\u2019t do anything for herself, depending on what the thing is. My father-in-law is expected to do everything and she gets angry with him if he doesn\u2019t do everything perfectly. She calls him lazy, but he is constantly running around, trying to take care of everything. She says that he\u2019s really ugly to her, constantly calling her ugly names and talking about divorce, but we don\u2019t ever really hear it so I don\u2019t know. \n\nThey have five animals that they don\u2019t care for properly, but this is sort of a cultural thing. They\u2019ve never cared for animals in the same way that we do, but that doesn\u2019t make it right. \n\nThey rarely bathe.  All that said, other than a possible bit of dementia that my father-in-law is showing, they are pretty normal mentally. They just aren\u2019t physically capable of living the way they used to, but they won\u2019t let anyone help them. Their house is so revolting. There are bugs everywhere and we can\u2019t get them under control, all of the floors and ceilings and walls are covered with dirt and cobwebs. When I told her the house was not safe or healthy to live in, she told me she didn\u2019t care. \n\nWe live in Texas. We have been out here on and off, partly because we were planning on moving to New Orleans and partly because we wanted to help them. Now we are going back to Texas and leaving them.\n\nThey are selling their house and moving to a suburban area near my brother-in-law, but they think they\u2019re going to go there and open a new business! They are not capable of running a business. They are in denial about what they\u2019re capable of doing. They are constantly broke because they blew through all of their savings and now they\u2019re trying to live on Social Security, which nobody can do.\n\nSo I don\u2019t really know what adult protective services does. I have no idea of calling them is the best choice, or if something else would be better. I know that they would be eligible for some kind of Medicaid waiver that might get them help with the house and personal care, but that doesn\u2019t address the root issues. Or maybe we should do nothing. \n\nI would love to hear from folks that have experience with this sort of thing, your  anecdotes and ideas and advice.",

Of course there were fights which is expected in childhood, but nothing out of the ordinary.\nHowever, things drastically changed when we were teenagers. He basically became my bully. He made sarcastic remarks a lot, was unfriendly towards everyone in the house and just an overall unpleasant human. He would ALWAYS be in a bad mood which made us uneasy in the house - I noticed that he truly was happy when his friends were there. We often got into petty arguments over small things which sometimes got physical. I remember a few times where he\u2019d literally throw me against the floor, smashed me into a window (still have a scar from that incident) and punched my back. If we weren\u2019t arguing, we literally never spoke to one another. Ever. We would simply ignore one another in the house and only speak if absolutely necessary. \n\nFast forward to our early adulthood, things didn\u2019t really change they just got slightly better. He then went travelling and moved out so I hardly saw him. \nIn our mid-20\u2019s, I noticed a difference in him. We were talking and being friendly towards each other. Our relationship still wasn\u2019t 100%, but our mum did tell me that he has noticed a change. \nHowever, maybe due to personal issues he\u2019s going through, he has become the same narcissist.\nMy 2 siblings and I are currently \u201cmeant\u201d to be planning an event for our mother but he has contributed barely anything towards it, even though he makes the most out of both of us + stated he\u2019d help us financially. Not only am I in a difficult situation due to his unfulfilled promises - I\u2019m out of pocket as a result of it.\n\nIn all honesty, I do not care for him at all, if he wasn\u2019t my blood I wouldn\u2019t like to know him. I feel sorry for his wife if he chooses to be married as he has very backward, misogynist views",

        "text": "I genuinely don\u2019t know who else to talk to so, naturally, I\u2019m turning to Reddit. \n\nSo today I come home around 5pm to my mother\u2019s house where my brother and sister (both older than me) are currently. I decided to lay down for a bit as I was tired from the day and needed a minute. When dinner was ready I get up and eat and whatever. Everything is well. Nothing out of the ordinary. So when I\u2019m done (I finish last) I go back to the couch to find my brother had taken one of the seats, and the other couch already full. Him on the smaller couch, I ask if he is able to move to another seat, as there are some single ones open, because I\u2019d like to lay down. Now, immediately, before he has a second to respond, my mother suddenly snaps, going \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to tell people what to do\u201d in this incredibly antagonistic voice that I\u2019ve never heard. I\u2019m confused now, and kind of stuck. I thought I genuinely said something wrong so I sort of put my hands up and begin to say something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201c but she cuts me off again and says in an even worse tone \u201chow dare you\u201d or something. Now I\u2019m getting slightly annoyed because I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about and won\u2019t explain, acting like I murdered her parents or something, but I suppress my anger. I think I was probably gonna ask her why she was so angry but she starts talking again. Meanwhile my brother still hasn\u2019t had a chance to respond to my initial question. She goes on this angry tirade about how I\u2019m not allowed to tell people what to do, that I\u2019m a horrible person, and something about Rosa Parks? (I assume this is referencing how Rosa Parks was told to move her seat on the bus?) So I don\u2019t have any idea what she\u2019s saying, the words make absolutely no sense, but clearly I can\u2019t get a word in so whatever. I just stand there, listening, and eventually she pauses (I guess cause I wasn\u2019t really reacting, given her surprised, puzzled look. People usually get annoyed immediately when she starts talking like this, though she never has to this degree) and continues again with \u201che\u2019s literally watching TV!\u201d as I turn to my brother, his head buried in his phone on the couch that doesn\u2019t face the television. So now I\u2019m pissed. She\u2019s been yelling at me for no reason, shit about how terrible of a son I am and how I\u2019m entitled and need to leave her house (this was after a tangent a week ago about how this is my house too and not just hers). So I yell back at her, with all the points I just made, and she stands up. Then, after she says something back and stomps away, still telling me to get out of the house, she suddenly freezes in her tracks and screams. I\u2019m so confused. She does this sort of drop, clearly acted, and realizes she probably shouldn\u2019t throw herself on the hardwood floor and flops onto this seat that\u2019s there instead, holding her hand(?) and squealing in pain. Mind you, there\u2019s no blood, nothing actually got hit, and there is literally no injury (as I could see later when I got a better look.) My sister FREAKS out, like I\u2019ve never seen before, and I mean never. For this ghost injury, she starts panicking saying things like \u201cdo we need to call 911\u201d and all this stuff, which she didn\u2019t even react like that when my brother broke his arm a while back or when our house flooded. I start questioning myself, thinking I did something even though I wasn\u2019t anywhere near her or that she really did have a bad injury. But suddenly, and I mean suddenly, after my brother got done screaming at me for hurting her and my sister stopped panicking, my mother almost snaps and rights herself, gets up, and walks away, like nothing happened. You know how cartoon characters will get those stars or birds around their head when they\u2019re dazed? That\u2019s what I felt like. At this point I\u2019m so damn confused. Unless she has super healing, she had no injury, and is laughing and playful not even two minutes later. She literally faked an injury so that my brother and sister would, too, be mad at me. And you know what? It worked. I didn\u2019t try speaking to my siblings at all but I could tell they wanted nothing to do with me. So it\u2019s silent for a while. Until she snaps again, maybe half an hour later, just before she\u2019s supposed to bring us back to our father\u2019s, and I don\u2019t hear her at first. But I take my headphones off after a moment as I realize she is screaming at me again. I don\u2019t pay attention anymore. Again, same shit about how horrible of a person I am, how I deserve nothing, I can\u2019t tell people what to do, etc. Right before we leave, she yelled at me that we were absolutely leaving in 5 minutes and that she\u2019d leave me behind if I wasn\u2019t ready in time. I get ready in less than 5, and the time passes. I bring this up maybe 10 minutes later and she pauses, stares at me, then goes \u201cSorry, I need to watch TV\u201d. I don\u2019t let this bug me and I just wait patiently in the hallway for her to finish and we leave. I Sorry if this is anticlimactic but real stories don\u2019t usually have a very satisfying ending. She brings us back, I go to my room and do whatever I need to do for the night and go to bed. In fact, I\u2019m in bed right now, and thinking this over is what brought me here, to share with others and get a different perspective, a fresh set of eyes. I just don\u2019t understand what went wrong. I asked my brother if he could move and my mother, who I wasn\u2019t at all speaking too, immediately blew up on me. Then she starts saying all these untrue and hurtful things about me, and my own brother and sister believe it. She even faked an injury just to make me look bad. I just want to know what happened and if anyone has ever had a similar experience and what steps i should take next. Thank you for taking the time to read, and apologies for the shitty writing. If y\u2019all need anything cleared up let me know.\n\nTL;DR : Went home, wanted to lay down and asked my brother if he could move to another spot, mother responds instead of brother and snaps, screams at me, calling me names and belittling me, attempts to kick me out of house. I don\u2019t know what to do so I ask Reddit.",

        "post-author": "Old_timey_Medic",
        "text": "Over the last 3 years my wife and I have been working at getting my grandmother out of her current living situation. She lives in one of the more dangerous cities in Massachusetts in a sketchy neighborhood. She lives with her verbally abusive sister. My mother is one of three children as she has two brothers. One in New Hampshire the other 20 minutes away in Ware. Now my mother and I have lived in New York since 2005 but we seem like the only ones who regularly do anything for my grandmother. Over the last 3 years we\u2019ve tried getting my grandmother closer but it always seems like me doing the work. My mother while she goes shopping for her every 2 weeks, when asked if she would take her mother in would make excuses left and right. It finally came to the point where my wife and I decided to take her in. We thought it would be best as we own our home, live in a quiet rural area where she can go outside and enjoy the fresh air (she doesn\u2019t leave the house), and we\u2019re close to healthcare (which she needs). The decision was made and my grandmother was on board and a date set. All of a sudden last week my grandmother changed course stating she\u2019s not moving and has been ignoring my mother and my calls and texts for the last week. I know this as I have read receipts on. I got to the point where I called in a welfare check with the Springfield Police. I am suspect that her sister has something to do with it since she found out our plan (we didn\u2019t tell her since she is mooching off my grandmother and is verbally abusive). Her sister went as far as telling my mother to not come to shop. If my mother doesn\u2019t go no one will. I feel bad for calling the welfare check but not only am I concerned for her wellbeing but, I feel that I needed to send a message. \n\nTL;DR: grandmother lives with abusive sister, abruptly changes mind after sister finds out that I\u2019m moving her in with me. Now being ignored I called welfare check and feel bad about it.",

        "title": "[30M] How do I support my GF [31F] through her parents' imploding marriage?",
        "post-author": "abnarrative",
        "text": "I (30M) am trying to figure out how best to support my girlfriend (31F, only child) who is caught in the middle of a pretty toxic situation involving her parents (74F, 68M). She knows I'm posting this. We're posting in a few places to try and get more advice.\n\nReal quick, about us: we met over 10 years ago in college. We reconnected and started dating long-distance about 5 years ago during the pandemic. When it was safe, we started visiting each other in person until I moved closer to her 4 years ago. We've been living happily together for 3 years.\n\n**The situation:**\u00a0A few months ago, my GF\u2019s mom confided that she's planning to divorce her dad. Her dad doesn't know yet.\n\nTo be honest, it's been a long time coming, my girlfriend agrees. They've had a pretty toxic marriage for as long as she can remember. And she and I live in our own place away from them, and we're all adults, so, technically, it really shouldn't be much of our business.\n\nBut knowing this secret has put my gf in a really tough spot. It's not the first time one of her parents has told her a secret to keep from the other, but this one is definitely the biggest and it's really eating at her, especially when she has to talk to her Dad and pretend like everything is normal.\n\nWe don't want to choose sides, but she also doesn't know what to think about either of them anymore or how to safely pull herself out of their mess. Unfortunately, in the years since she left for college, there's been a maze of added complications that make the whole situation harder\u2026\n\n**The complications:**\n\n* **Emotional abuse:**\u00a0Her mom reports that behind closed doors, her dad has been making threatening comments with increasingly violent undertones. He yells and has even chased after her mom around the house when she has tried to leave the conversation. According to my gf, he's always had a temper but he's never been mean to my gf and he has never actually been violent to either of them. Yet. This is really hard for my girlfriend to process alongside the mostly positive relationship she's always had with her father\n* **Financial clusterfuck:**\u00a0Her dad controls all their money. Her mom took out a $500 credit card limit for herself (apparently, he was furious when he found out). However, my GF's mother has also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Scientology, using retirement money my GF's dad was saving for the two of them to travel. He knows about this and is not happy but for some reason he hasn't done anything to stop it as far as we know. In fact, since retiring, he seems to have made a lot of concessions on things in order to make his wife happy (sold his retirement home, moved to a different town away from the countryside so she could be closer to things). Nothing excuses emotional/verbal abuse from him but it's messy from all angles.\n* **Concerning plan:**\u00a0To be clear, we're not trying to salvage their marriage in any way, we think the divorce is overdue. But her mom says when she leaves, she plans to disappear with a note and travel far away to be safe. Which we\u2019ll support if she needs it but she\u2019s also made comments along the lines of \"nothing will really change after the separation\u201d which honestly worries us about whether she's fully thinking through her plan\n* **Age/health factors:**\u00a0Both parents are older with past head injuries from separate unrelated accidents, and there's family history of dementia. I hesitated to include this but there have just been some weird decisions from both of them that are hard to understand sometimes. For instance, we recently learned that her mother was trying to help a family member who has a history of poor judgement and even stealing from other family members. Apparently her mother knowingly sent this family member a form that included her own social-security number.\n\n**My questions:**\n\nI don't know what to advise my girlfriend to do. We know this shouldn't fall on her, and we know that she'll need therapy as part of her support system. But in the meantime, the anticipation of this divorce is eating at her and I just want to help protect her from being stuck as a ragdoll in their marriage any longer.\n\nAs I said above, she knows I'm writing this and helped me write it. I'd feel more comfortable helping her and advising her if I heard from others:\n\n1. Should my girlfriend keep this secret? It's honestly tearing her apart to lie to her dad when she talks to him, but breaking her mom's confidence feels wrong too, especially with safety concerns.\n2. What kind of relationships do we maintain with both parents when one is apparently being abusive and the other has made some really questionable decisions?\n3. How do we set boundaries? My GF has tried to set boundaries in the past and it is ALWAYS met with passive aggression or emotional manipulation. At this point, she says she'd rather go low-contact with both but doesn't know how to pull that trigger, especially since the three of them have been such a close unit her whole life.\n\n***TL;DR:***\u00a0*GF's mom planning secret divorce from potentially abusive dad. GF not sure how to stomach keeping the secret or even how to still maintain a relationship with either of them after all this.*",

No one seemed to care that he was mentally unstable and struggling with multiple mental illnesses. They just took him away. Just like that, he was gone.\n\nI was heartbroken, but I didn\u2019t really understand what was happening. I thought he\u2019d be back soon. I waited. But he never came back.\n\nIn all those four years, I never visited him. Not once. I was scared\u2014scared of seeing him like that, in a place like that. So I stayed away.\n\nNow, he\u2019s finally coming home. This Monday. And I don\u2019t know how to feel. I\u2019m happy, of course\u2014I\u2019ve missed him more than I can explain. But there\u2019s also this deep, gnawing guilt. I left him. I wasn\u2019t there when he needed me most.\n\nMy mom and sister visited him every few months. The way they described him broke my heart. They said he looked thinner, that his face was hidden behind a mess of hair. The medication they forced on him made his eyes go cockeyed. Hearing that\u2014it crushed me. I had convinced myself that he was okay, that he was getting help. But now it just sounds like he was being punished for being sick.\n\nI hate that I didn\u2019t see it. I hate that I didn\u2019t visit. I hate that I wasn\u2019t there to support him. And I hate myself for all of it.\n\nSo here I am, asking one question that\u2019s been sitting heavy on my heart\nAm I a bad brother?\n",

And I apologise for my bad grammar/punctuation.) I am 15 and am about to turn 16 in July. My little sister is 7 years old. \n\nI have autism. \n\nAlthough it isn\u2019t anything major, I compare it Asperger\u2019s syndrome. But I don\u2019t think that that gets diagnosed anymore.\n\nI realise that I\u2019m rambling. But to make a not so long story short, I don\u2019t know how to explain express my emotions properly. I think.\n\nToday at around 17:00 my mum and dad started arguing. It started as the two of them belittling each other before then going into a shouting match.\n\nI was playing Star Wars Battlefront II with her because it is one of my favourite games and she seemed to like it.\n\nBut when my parents started screaming at each other, she looked up at me with her lower lip trembling. And she whimpered quietly to me:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d\n\nThose two words broke me.\n\nSo here I am at 2 AM, balling my eyes out because I\u2019ve just now realised how powerless I am when I\u2019ve just realised one simple thing. I can\u2019t do anything to make her happier.\n\nI have a few reasons for this.\n\n1. I\u2019m a pussy and can\u2019t stand up to my parents.\n\n2.

Problem is, I am pretty dang sure that in the paperwork it says that I will have to spend an entire month with my dad. Which, isn't bad, but that's longer than every other weekend.\n\nAnd in June, me and my older brother will be away at summer camp for a few days. It would be the first time in about a year that they were the only ones with him overnight. Some things were said, and either brushed away as rumors or believed.\n\nI am a little worried, and would like to know if anyone else has had this situation and how you handled it. Thankyou!",

It's pretty common for the parent who doesn't get to see their kids as much has them more during summer and winter break. Depending on your age, you would have more of a say in your custody. \n\nWhat are you asking?",

After saving for many years I've very recently bought my own home and currently trying to furnish the place. Comparatively my other family members have had huge amounts of help in every way a person can be helped and their lives have been able to blossom with the support they've received. Me and my partner are really flying solo here. \n\nI think this is an uncomfortable truth, to the point that I think if I were to make my case, family would venomously argue that it wasn't true, despite it being a fact. You could literally quantify that sh*t. It wouldn't have occurred to them how unfair this all is.\n\nIt's probably also worth mentioning that the parent in question is a bit of a demon around their birthday. Extremely entitled, a brat, ungrateful and weird. The nail in the coffin being hammered in a few years ago when they behaved extremely bad towards me, when I was in a vulnerable point in my life, a real kick in the teeth as I'd gone to great lengths to make it a nice day. \n\nI'd planned with my partner to make myself busy for their birthdays as much as possible but as this is a big one and everyone is making a huge fuss I can't get away with it. \n\nQuite a few people are only making a fuss because they don't want to deal with the fall out of not making a big deal. That's how toxic the whole situation is. I don't like it :-( ",

        "post-author": "Pure-Listen4205",
        "text": "Hi, guys. This is my first time writing, and there is a big chance that I might delete this later, but I really need help and excuse my english and grammar because it's not my first language and please bear with me to the end because this might be long. My dad, 58 M, used to be an abuser who hurt my two over brother, especially the oldest one now 22 and 19 years old, let's call then T and S because I don't really want to share something this private. My dad is a freaking narcissist, the biggest red flag and even has anger issues. He makes a big fight about small and useless things, he gives us the silent treatment as if he's a freaking child and shouts and yells at anyone anytime, and he hasn't gone one day without making it clear that he hates S guts?(my oldest brother). Mind you, we're a family of eight, mom, dad, and six children. A little back story, dad used to hit S and T a lot when they were young. He used to bully them(especially T because he was chubby when he was younger.) He picks the biggest fights with S ON purpose, he curses at him, hits him, and even threatened him with a knife 3 to 4 times before. (Mind you, this all happened in front of our whole family, aka, my two younger siblings and they were traumatise, just like me.) He only stopped hitting S when S got more bulk and huge as the years went on because S went to the gym and things like that. In the past, Every time dad did something traumatising to us or to S in front of us, mom wouldn't fight back and just try to come between them because dad used to always scare S when he was younger. And because of all of that, we came to hate dad as years went on, well, at least not my two younger siblings because thanks god they forget quickly and don't hold grudges because they are still little kids and he lies to then about being the \"best dad\" Just because he gets them candies. Recently, about two months ago, aunt had calmed things down between dad and S, even though S didn't want to, and he had the right because dad had threatened him with a knife AGAIN, but he still went with it. Life was a bit peaceful for a month or so, which was ramadan by the way. Until dad started randomly picking on useless things like how S would get back home \"late\" (Which was like 11 or 12 pm!!) And literally bad mouth him THE moment S is out of the house. And now, he told mom, in front of me, that it's either a divorce, or she finds a solution. There's a big chance that the \"solution\" Dad wants is that S gets out of the house since he's graduating in a couple of months. I am so freaking tired or his shenanigens or what ever it's called and it's emotionally and physically draining. This is not all, but I didn't want the post to be too long. So please, if any of you guys have any advice, please tell me because I need any help I could get. Thanks. ",

I am very close with his family and we spend a lot of time together. 3 years ago his sister married a man very quickly and spontaneously. Over time we have all come to realize he is an extreme narcissist who mentally and verbally abuses my partner\u2019s sister. I feel so sad when I think about the abuse she is enduring. I have tried on multiple occasions to get her help and to get her to consider leaving but I think the control he has over her is too strong. He controls every aspect of her life. It is becoming increasingly difficult for me to attend family events when he is around. It makes me so angry just being in his presence. His birthday is coming up and I know for sure they will throw a party for him but I can\u2019t morally celebrate a man that is so disrespectful and abusive. I am considering not going at all but that may cause friction in the family. I am open to advice on how to handle this situation. Do I protect my peace and not attend certain events that I know he will be at? I don\u2019t want my partner\u2019s sister to feel I am abandoning her but at the same time I cannot stand being around her husband. Please help!",

        "text": "I'm (23F) hypersensitive. Sounds, Lights, Touch, even a tad bit extra stresses me out. And so does literally everything. People talking to me in a different way, they don't even have to have a time, just different.. it overwhelms me. I overthink to the point that I'm crying myself to sleep everyday for the last few months.\n\nI feel like I don't even know how to communicate. I try to explain my pov calmly, no one gets it, and I feel stupid.\n\nOn my birthday, my whole family first decided to celebrate it at home, and I was cool with it. But they changed plans without even talking to me, and informed me to get ready in 10 minutes. I was in the middle of a Valo match with my boyfriend, who I can only video chat (ldr). I tried to contain myself, just abandoned the match, got up to get ready, but let them know It's gonna take 30 minutes ish because I was still in my pajamas. 20 minutes passed, their plan changed again, and that frustrated me and I yelled if it is a joke. Now they yelled back at me that I'm taking too long. Wtf? So they cancelled when we're going to a place where you don't even have reservations? Ok. And then I get downstairs and they're asking me again \"you're not ready yet?\". \n\nIdk it feels like as much as I try to stay calm knowing myself, people around me like to poke me. And they don't spare me one bit.\nEveryone does the exact opposite of what I ask or expect them to do, even if I'm very clear.\n\nIg I'm rambling right now. It feels like 1000 different things in my head going on at the same time, it exhausts me mentally and physically, and people just tell me to think about one thing at a time or just calm down or just take it easy. Like Bro I'd do it if I knew how and no one wants to teach that to me.\n\nMy sister and I have to share a room and a bed (Don't ask). And she leaves packets of chips, candy, dished on the fucking bed. Not one morning passed by when I didn't flush her shit down the toilet first because she always forgets and then denied ever going to the bathroom like wtf you mean you don't shit ever? And I try to stay calm, try to not confront or address the issue calmly, but nothing changes. And then one day I explode and SHE YELLS AT ME that how dare I yell at her. SHE IS 6 YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME.\n\n When I was younger, my mom was violent and abusive. And my elder cousins would tell her lies about me doing shit, or provoke me tk the point I yell at them to stop, and mom would see that, and I'd get in trouble for that and the cousins would just watch and laugh.\n\n23 years of my life, I've only seen them as bullies who I have to live with. I've felt like I'm just a toy they keep smacking around and do whatever they want just to entertain themselves.\nMy whole family is just a freak show to me at this point and they wonder why i don't talk to them being in the same house. I blame them for how I am today, anxious, fear of not being understood or heard, hating myself to the core .\n\nI can't even go to therapy because there are no good therapists where I live, and when I asked my family they suggest to go to a family friend - which is my dad's best friend - and that's because they'll get to know what I talk about. \n\nEvery day I try to not repeat it, but it's getting exhausting.",

        "text": "\nMy daughter\u2019s 2nd birthday is coming up. My dad and I aren\u2019t close as much as I want to be he comes to visit maybe 2-3 X a year even though he lives fairly close. He calls me once a month and only talks about himself. I had to start holding him more accountable and calling him multiple times day of his visit bc he\u2019d continuously no show day of. \n\nNext weekend is my daughter\u2019s 2nd birthday. My dad\u2019s known about the date since he asked me over 8 months ago. We decided this year we\u2019re going to a buffet restaurant and my in laws will be there. All of my family except my dad has dropped off the face of the earth since I had children it seems. So I was exited to invite him and I told him the time and place and his gf in the background started yelling. We\u2019re currently NC and I hear her calling me inconsiderate and redirecting my dad to tell me something.\n\nMy dad tells me they\u2019re going to a rollercoaster park that day. Mind you this park is literally ON THE WAY to my house. And that they\u2019ll be there from 8am-midnight. I told him I was confused why he couldn\u2019t come as I used to work there so I know they open at 10 and the party is at 10 so I don\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t just go a little late and eat first. He insisted he wants to be there early for parking.\n\nHe asked me if I can switch the day to which I said I cannot as we already have told everyone else and I\u2019ve arranged everything for that day over three months ago. I asked him when he\u2019d like to come by to see my daughter if he can\u2019t come to her party and he said he doesn\u2019t know he\u2019ll have to get back to me. I just let out a big sigh and said okay and said bye.\n\nWhen I told my in laws they were absolutely raging. My in laws are paying for some of the this party and they were very disappointed to hear what he had to say. I explained to them I did offer to move the time a little later so he could leave at noon and come have lunch with us instead but he declined. Going through this weird stage of my dad wanting nothing to do with me is hard but my in laws being upset about it makes it that much harder.\n\nI told my in laws I extended the invitation and that\u2019s all I can really do. I don\u2019t know if my dad realizes it but not only is he damaging the relationship with me but he is with my in laws as well. He didn\u2019t show for thanksgiving or Christmas and they were upset since he insisted on coming and we set a place for him.",

And some of that time we went completely NC, for 2-3 yrs straight at times. Bc i just wasnt going to deal with the blatentness of it, or let it affect my kids like it did me and my sister. But then,  he finally got tired of her and her hoarding lifestyle and she moved out and we were able to begin to rebuild our relationship again, and yes we had it out and i told him about himself,  and he told me about myself and about himself and we have worked towards a pretty good relationship,  which he's also built up with his grandkids,  too.  I believe now that he was a victim of her manipulation as well....but he ALLOWED it for so long, and that's the part i really had a hard time getting over. Why would you let someone else dictate your relationship with your own kids and grandkids is just something i can't understand,  bc i would NEVER my kids are first for me and I'd put a person in their place real quick the first time they ever even made a notion towards getting in between that.",

Me and my sister were the main ones taking care of him, like the real stuff doctor appointments, grocery runs, cleaning up after falls, and yeah\u2026 sometimes having to clean him up when he couldn\u2019t make it to the bathroom. It got real.\n\nWe had gotten him a One Call Alert bracelet after he fell a couple times and couldn\u2019t get to his phone. Thing legit saved us a bunch of times, not even kidding. He\u2019d hit the button, and we\u2019d get the call, and boom we were on the way. It was actually wild how fast we got the alerts. Way better than hoping he could dial a number or yell loud enough. If you\u2019re looking into stuff for your aging parents, 10/10 recommend.\n\nAnyway here\u2019s where it gets messy. Our older siblings (they live like 3 hrs away) didn\u2019t do much. They\u2019d send a little money now and then and think that was enough. I\u2019m like bro, we\u2019re burning out here. I straight up told them we needed help not cash, actual help. Crickets. Then they show up at the funeral all shocked and sad like they didn\u2019t have YEARS to show up for him while he was alive.\n\nI got into it with my brother after everything went down, said some stuff I don\u2019t regret, and we haven\u2019t talked since. Folks keep telling me to let it go, to \"reconcile\" and all that, but honestly? I\u2019m tired of being the one who has to hold everything together. I did the hard part. I showed up. I dealt with the pain, the mess, the guilt, the grief. All of it.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m saying is\u2026 for anyone who\u2019s been through this\u2014being the main caregiver, dealing with the family fallout, relying on stuff like the One Call Alert bracelet just to sleep at night\u2014how do you keep from going numb? And would you actually reach back out and try to patch things up with the sibling who ghosted when things were hard?\n\nNot really looking for pity just wondering if I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s been through this.\n\nAppreciate any real thoughts",

It was one of the few that didn\u2019t overcomplicate things. The device is wearable, comfortable, and has fall detection that alerts their center even if she can\u2019t push the button herself.\n\nI tested it myself, and the response was fast and professional. We\u2019ve had it for a few months and she actually remembers to wear it, which says a lot. Highly recommend if your loved one struggles with tech but needs real protection.",

It\u2019s unfair that your other family members might not attend simply because those cousins won\u2019t be there if their parents aren't invited.\n\nBut remember: this is your wedding. It\u2019s a time to be surrounded by the people who love and support you\u2014those who show up with joy in their hearts, not drama. You shouldn't have to worry about \"family\" causing pain or distraction on such a meaningful day.\n\nI can relate. One of my sisters is estranged from the rest of our family. She was invited to my son\u2019s wedding and spent the whole day stirring up trouble\u2014talking poorly about another sister, her husband, and even our father. That was the last wedding she was invited to. When my other two children got married, she wasn\u2019t on the guest list. Unfortunately, that also meant her sons (my nephews) chose not to attend any family weddings after that. It's sad, but that\u2019s the reality of the choices people make.\n\nThe good news? Those later weddings were beautiful\u2014full of love, laughter, and no drama. They were everything a wedding should be.\n\nYou deserve the same. Don\u2019t let the negativity of a few overshadow a day that\u2019s meant to be full of joy. Sometimes peace comes from drawing boundaries\u2014and that\u2019s okay.",

He\u2019s always been the kind of person who sees everything as a responsibility. He shows up for everyone else\u2014friends, relatives\u2014making sure they\u2019re happy at every event. But when it comes to us, he\u2019s always absent.\n\nIt hurts so much because he\u2019s a good person, but he\u2019s always been emotionally unavailable. My parents\u2019 marriage has been unhappy for years, and they\u2019re basically estranged. My father treats everything in life like a duty, but I just wish he cared enough to show up for us\u2014not just physically, but emotionally too.\n\nI\u2019m heartbroken . I don\u2019t know how to cope with this feeling of being an afterthought. Has anyone else gone through this? How do you handle it when your dad doesn\u2019t prioritize you or your family? Any advice would mean a lot.\n\n\n",

        "text": "I haven't spoken to my father in 8 years, or my oldest brother in 3. In my father's case it was due to childhood abuse (all kinds) that was continuing emotionally. I made it clear to him that I wasn't interested in having a relationship with him and had to threaten legal action to get him to stay away. With my oldest brother it's because he is an alcoholic and baited me to end my life when I was extremely depressed. I also generally had a poor relationship with him anyway and that was the straw that broke the camel's back. \n\nI don't like having to go NC with my family because it is stressful and sad, but going nc with these two has been better for my mental health. Not having to interact with people who make me feel like shit has been my priority, which, while I'm called selfish and childish and everything else for it by other family members, I think is worthwhile. \n\nUnfortunately my other brother has become increasingly insufferable. He lives overseas but has 2 kids and a wife so he calls more often these days because he thinks I want to see his kids (I dont, especially). He has some extremely bizarre beliefs like Holocaust denial, antivaxx stuff, aliens being in control of government, etc. He's paranoid, I believe due to longterm weed use and underlying psychological issues. But he will not listen to anything that doesn't support his delusions and gets hostile when proven wrong. He also has more or less every far-right \nbelief around and has no empathy. I really dread hearing from him. Believe me when I say that there is no hope for this person. \n\nI don't have any desire to maintain a relationship with him but I know going NC will only cause more conflict in my family. I'm old enough to live alone and am trying to arrange this, but am currently living with a relative due to financial issues on both our sides. I don't want the stress of more conflict but I'm also really sick and tired of my family in general. ",

        "post-author": "IronicallyCynical",
        "text": "Recently, my mother has been having issues with her heart. It\u2019s not pumping right, her blood pressure has skyrocketed, and overall she isn\u2019t doing well. She\u2019s tired, can\u2019t eat, and still works.\n\nLast night I (18F) decided to sleep near her bedroom on the same floor of the house (basement) because I was worried. I stayed up until 4am, and woke back up at 6am to help her with our dogs. I slept the rest of the day until 2pm where I fed them all for lunch. For the sake of simplicity, I\u2019ll only mention the Corgi and Akita.\n\nWe live in the country, so we have a big arena where our cattle walk. I was taking the Akita out after lunch and walking him around. I saw the Corgi in the arena and didn\u2019t think much of it. I called him back over pretty quickly. I knew he wouldn\u2019t listen based off past history (he never does) and saw him running back so I turned my attention back to the Akita. This Corgi is known for rolling around in the cow feces, but again, I didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\nI went inside, got all the dogs in, and immediately went back to the basement. I wasn\u2019t on the main floor or the second for very long.\n\nWhen my mother arrived home from work, I noticed a weird smell. I only smelt it near the door though whenever I WAS on the main floor, so I just sprayed some Febreeze and went outside to help her with groceries.\n\nShe noticed the smell before I did and flipped out once she and I realized it was from the Corgi that was next to her car. I quickly brought in the groceries as she stood on the porch, complaining that she was stressed and the thing she comes home to is this. When she asks how I seriously didn\u2019t smell him, I told her I only did at the front door and I wasn\u2019t near him for the majority of the day. \n\nShe called me a pathological liar and that something was seriously wrong with me internally. I tried to shrug it off because as a kid, I\u2019d constantly lie if I hadn\u2019t done something she had told me to do in fear of her getting angry. That, or I\u2019d tell her I did it, and then try to run to get it done before she noticed. So this, I understand.\n\nShe then started yelling at me again while hosing and scrubbing down the Corgi. I think I told her I\u2019d handle it, and that I was fine with doing so, but I don\u2019t remember anymore. I rolled up my pants legs and was ready to do it, but she wouldn\u2019t wait. She rough-houses the dog, pushing him down so he stays still while scrubbing. Meanwhile, she\u2019s complaining about how her clothes are ruined from the water hose she\u2019s using because of me and that the nearby neighbors now have to listen to her \u201cbitch\u201d about/to me.\n\nShe goes on to say that I\u2019m not ready for college because I\u2019m basically incompetent (ex. \u201cYou always have your head up your ass\u201d, calling me self-centered for not thinking far ahead, etc), I\u2019m a liar, and that she already thought about \u201cending\u201d it because she\u2019s stressed and tired of living like this. \n\n\u201cYou know, I have a gun downstairs. Maybe I should just fucking shoot myself, I\u2019ve already thought about it before! Better than having to deal with this shit everyday.\u201d\n\nI stopped trying to talk and just focused on drying the dog once she went inside the house. I could hear her cussing and yelling, then the door slam when she went downstairs to the basement. Once I got inside, I saw my phone and the texts. She told me to put the groceries up, handle the dogs for the night, and to grab all my stuff from the basement and bring it back to my room.\n\nSo now I\u2019m sitting here in my bedroom.\n\nTl;Dr: I know I\u2019ve been a complicated kid. I\u2019ve costed my parents a lot of money before (ex. cavities from laziness), and my mother threatening her own life isn\u2019t new, but this one just hurt a lot. I go back and forth between thinking I\u2019m a terrible daughter. Am I?",

When he was say 23ish he had a daughter with his GF at the time. They had a very toxic relationship so he decided when his daughter was 3 years old to give up rights and allow the mothers new husband to adopt her.  At the time it was absolutely devastating to us as we had developed a relationship as well as my husband and I our oldest daughter as well. We believe it was all about the $$ child support but my in-laws mainly mil insisted we have no contact. Fast forward after years later and this same BIL had been married for maybe 9 years? And had a son with his wife. He decides to divorce and when he divorced he didn't just stop contact with his now x-wife but son as well. Completely stopped. Said he just couldn't handle it. His whole life has been about $$ and how he can't afford to have relationships. The crazy thing is he now has made contact with his daughter and have somewhat of a relationship- which we think she must be as crazy as him. And now that his son is turning 18 and he doesn't have to pay child support he wants to \"rekindle\" his relationship with him. We have stayed in contact with his son and know that he has no desire. To add to this, the latest my BIL has shared with my husband is that he wants to marry again but it has to be a Christian woman because that is his beliefs now. Am I off for thinking \"Seriously? Get your life fixed and your relationship with your son. If you say you are now a Christian?\"  And what Christian woman in her right mind would marry a man who has walked away from not 1 child but 2?  Please bring on your insight. \n",

        "text": "For a quick overview on the situation, they\u2019re still legally married, and me(13f) my mother and my younger siblings have been living on a new property for nearly 6 months now.\n\nWe first moved in (2020) all together in a house in town, and although it may have been better for the first year or so, it always felt somewhat uncomfortable. Around the time my now 2yr old sister was born, he started going mentally ill. According to my mom, he went home to play League of Legends while my sister was being born. Video games would also be a multi branched problem later in time. Later during that time, he began to subtly verbally abuse me and my siblings, and physically abuse my brothers. On various occasions he had violent outbursts where he would go to his parents (who mollycoddled him throughout life) house. On the one of the last time where he\u2019d stayed at his parents house, (he\u2019d refused to get mental help) he\u2019d escaped and broken into our home later that night. I was sleeping in my mom\u2019s bed, and remember being too mortified to move, and I guess they talked outside the room. He also managed to demonize my dance teachers (who helped us through each crises) every time he won my mom back.\n\nI won\u2019t go into too many details, but now I am sitting in my room writing this while, they talked outside in the kitchen at 11:30pm, and even the sound of his voice makes me cringe and remember his manipulation tactics. I refused to come out of my room the last two times he came to talk, and I can\u2019t fathom that my mom let him see my siblings. She claims he says he\u2019s gotten \u201chelp\u201d and although the possibility is true, the four years I\u2019d lived in his dictatorship has left me emotionally scarred and unsure around most men.\n\nHer various attempts to convince me to forgive him have born no fruition, and she can\u2019t seem to understand that I feel betrayed that she disrespects the decision we\u2019d made to cut him out of our lives. Even now I hear him telling my mom all his bullshit about (and I am completely serious here) baby eating gangs. I don\u2019t believe he is mentally stable despite my mom\u2019s berating about talking to him and having a lovely conversation.\n\nMy mom has threatened my siblings by speaking out her ass about how \u201cwe\u2019d be cut off from the dance recital\u201d if we told our teachers about her recent activity. Again they are being villainized as he emerges back into her life. She makes chicken shit decisions regarding her romantic relationships, and I fear for my own mental health as I feel myself fall into a high functioning depressive state. I don\u2019t want to be taken away by social services, I have plans to go to a prestigious ballet school, and that would possibly ruin my career. I love my mom, but I don\u2019t respect her decision making.\n\n(Not sure if I\u2019m doing this right but a summary?\ud83d\udc47\nMy mother is trying to get back with my abusive step dad and I\u2019m not sure how to act, I\u2019m unsure as to whether or not she\u2019ll actually listen to me on this, as she steps on me with large things like these to be righteous in her own eyes, unfortunately like most adults.

        "text": "Might as well share this story here, submit my own woes to the drama mill. The situation is still actively affecting my life even if I\u2019ve mostly gotten away from everything. NSFW tag is for mention of (attempted???) child grooming. \n\nI could write essays on my mom and all the things she\u2019s done and hasn\u2019t done, but that\u2019s not really relevant \u2014 just keep in mind she\u2019s established a habit of being self-concerned and unwilling to do emotional work. My parents divorced when I was 13, and a year later my mom had a boyfriend moving in with us. I didn\u2019t like him from the start: bigoted, lazy, crude, intimidatingly tall and broad. Mom made us hug the moment we met, off to a great start.\n\nAt the drop of a hat he would yell at me, and go on these half hour long tirades about how I\u2019m a terrible child and the world won\u2019t coddle me and I\u2019m \u201cusing my mom like my bitch\u201d because I was a teenager who had the audacity to ask for dinner or help cleaning my room. This happened in front of my mom and she wouldn\u2019t say a word. She\u2019d hold me while I cried, occasionally throw out a half-assed \u201choney, calm down,\u201d but the only thing that ever stopped him was his own frustration when he would finally storm out of the house and slam the door. Mom \u201cwould talk to him about it\u201d; nothing ever changed. They got engaged when I was 15. \n\nThe blowups slowly stopped, and by the time I was 17 and he was 62 (and my mom 57, for the record, no weird age gap there she just had me old), covid happened and everyone was stuck at home. That\u2019s when he got weird. Increasingly sexual comments about me. \u201cJokes\u201d, \u201ccompliments\u201d. Never in front of mom. Mom would go to bed first; he got in the habit of \u201casking\u201d me for goodnight kisses when it was time for him to join her. They escalated to the mouth, and that\u2019s when I told my therapist and CPS thankfully got involved; I got a restraining order and moved in full time with my biodad who is an angel. (Did I try telling my mom before my therapist, yes. What did she say, \u201che was just trying to be relatable\u201d\u2026.) \n\nMom and the fianc\u00e9 from hell tied the knot when I was 19- while the restraining order was active! The ensuing situation was EXTREMELY messy and I don\u2019t know how much of it was my mom as a genuine victim of her own mental illness and possibly her husband, and how much of it was her just being content with living the life she\u2019s chosen to live. In any case, he whisked her away to the other side of the country and controlled her phone usage and was very prickly with what little information he gave me. I didn\u2019t have a proper conversation with her in probably a year. \n\nMy mom is ostensibly much better now. She sounds like her old self again, we have pleasant conversations on her own phone that feel \u201clike old times\u201d. The real kicker is that just a few weeks ago, after two years or so being gone, they suddenly decided to drive back up home. They\u2019re two hours away from me now. I had the opportunity to see my mom on mother\u2019s day\u2026 and I didn\u2019t. I absolutely refuse to put myself in the vicinity of her husband and have stressed to her that this is non-negotiable, she said \u201cwe\u2019ll figure it out\u201d and hasn\u2019t said a word on it since.\n\nDon\u2019t know what conclusion I have here. It just sucks. I\u2019m worried she\u2019s a victim of him, sure, but she had every opportunity to kick him out when he hurt the child she talks such a big talk about fiercely protecting. \n\nTL;DR: My mom knowingly married the guy who repeatedly screamed at me and later got groomy with me, then vanished on me for years and now that she\u2019s finally nearby again still won\u2019t see me.

They both live with my parents and I live out of the house with my partner. \n\nI\u2019m grieving about both of my brothers. I get nostalgic for times we did talk more and felt closer. They both have such extreme issues that it\u2019s not possible to have a relationship with either of them. I just texted one bro about how I miss when we used to talk about music, mentioning a couple of personal things related to that. He opened the message and didn\u2019t reply. His chronic pain + eternal misery + narcissist tendencies has really made him fade away from any sort of connection. \n\nI think I need a way to accept the things I cannot change (therapy?), but I find it really painful. We were never a functional family, but I did hold on fondly to the moments when we felt like a family and had good memories. It feels like it\u2019ll never happen like that again. Mourning over a sibling feels like mourning a part of myself. I know not everyone feels that way about blood. Being autistic and all traumatized in our own ways has always made it difficult. I guess I play a certain role in my family as the more emotional type.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m either dissociated from the grief about it or reeling from it. I don\u2019t know how to heal or let it go. But I also know I romanticize tiny breadcrumbs. Realistically, neither were ever really there for me.  I just wish wish wish things could be different.\n\nCan anyone relate? Or offer some words of emotional support? A bigger picture I can\u2019t see? Thanks so much for reading xx",

He doesn\u2019t like to be around me when he\u2019s getting high on meth). Every time he sees me he cries a little because he feels guilty that drugs took over and for cheating on my mom. Thankfully they never married, that would\u2019ve put more stress on my mom (they were pretty young when I was born my mom just turned 20 and my dad just turned 23). I\u2019ve had dreams of having a normal family where my mom and dad are together and when I wake up I start sobbing. Even thinking about those dreams makes me cry. My last memory of them together was when I was around 3 or 4, and we were all laying in bed together. I was awake in between them and they were both asleep. I remember being so happy in that moment. I wish I could go back in time and tell them not to get together so I wouldn\u2019t have to go through this.

When  I yell back I still hurt, why? Because I\u2019m stupidly empathetic and feel bad that I yelled at them but do they feel bad??? Nope! They do not!",

        "text": "My dad, 51, has been married to my mom for the past 25 years. More often than not, my parents have always found some way to start arguing, and I do believe that divorce was considered an option at some point. The arguing has decreased recently, but I started noticing something weird in my dad's behaviour these past couple of years. I often go out with my dad, whether it be with my mom coming along or not, and I began to recognize a particular behaviour from him. Being that he is married, I thought that I would never even see something like this, yet any time we pass by a mildly attractive woman, he cannot control himself from staring at their ass and boobs. When I'm riding with him on the bike, he'll go as far as to turn his head around once he's passed a girl, just to catch a glimpse of their body one last time. He's done this with women his age, and even with girls around my age, about 16 or 17 years old. Both me and my brother have seemed to notice this behaviour, and I think he acknowledged this, though he does not seem to care. This thing has been going on almost every time we're out with him, and it doesn't show signs of stopping. The things that makes me incredibly mad is the fact that he has the bravery to be staring at underage girls' bodies, right in front of me and my mom, especially whilst being married. My mom does not seem to notice this, or maybe she simply does not care. I've caught him looking up porn several times now, and I'm really unsure of what to do.",

He knows he stares at girls and women in front of you and your mom and he simply doesn\u2019t care. He doesn\u2019t respect either of you. There are men out there who love and respect their wives and children. He is making a choice to let his dick and inappropriate thoughts direct his actions. You\u2019re his young daughter, so don\u2019t feel it\u2019s your responsibility to talk to him about it. I do think it\u2019s reasonable to talk to your mom and underscore how uncomfortable you get and how disgusting you think this is, but she\u2019s been choosing to ignore it and has to decide on her own how to move forward. You could also try to tell your brother that your dad\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t okay and girls find it creepy, so he doesn\u2019t normalize it and replicate it because he isn\u2019t getting a good example",

They can be pretty tough to handle.  A private, honest conversation with your dad might help curb these misdirected urges.\n\nMaybe tell him you ran across an older person who strongly advises:  Don't make any sudden changes while these hormones are fluctuating - not marital, financial, or anything with long lasting effects on your life.  Just fight to maintain until this stage is over.  It will ease up, usually within maybe three or four years.  Don't allow this difficult time to destroy your life.  I've heard it said, \"If you let your emotions rule your life, they will ruin your life\".\n\nDoes your family have any religious beliefs?  Yeah, now is the time for prayer.  I've seen this stage rip entire families to shreds, and it is literally such a crying shame.  Once those hormones settle, they always regret their mistakes.  By then, it's often too late.  Help your dad keep control the best you can young man.  Talk to him privately.  Remember this as you age, so that you can make wiser decisions.  You know what?  These hormonal changes are also really hard on women too.\n\nHormone influxes are just as confusing and disruptive at 50 as they were at 13.\n\nPS You are such a good son to address this problem.

Your current actions can have long-lasting consequences for yourself and others\u2014consequences that you may not yet be fully aware of. Overinterpreting a situation or reacting too harshly can lead to outcomes that may later be deeply regretted.\n\n**Now, in reference to your (potential) situation:**  \nIf one is brave enough to publicly question such a topic\u2014and even go so far as to label one's own father a \"creep\"\u2014then why not be just as courageous in a way that a family member, at the very least, deserves?  \nA potential example: You're walking with your brother and your father. You notice a situation and say,  \n*\"Hey Dad, we've noticed that you often look at different women. What's that about?\"*\n\nBy doing this, you create space for positive development. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t aware that you noticed and may choose to change his behavior\u2014or even begin to reflect more deeply on his actions. There\u2019s also the chance that he gives you an explanation that puts things in a completely different light (who knows, maybe he wants to become a women's fashion designer \ud83d\ude09).  \nWhatever the outcome, it will likely be easier for all of you to understand and deal with it constructively.\n\nI am aware that my response is unconventional. But it goes beyond the usual patterns of thought, and my hope is to offer a perspective that helps resolve such situations in a long-term, positive manner.\n\n**I wish you the very best.**",

Of course I book the earliest flight possible (literally was told 6AM PST and was on a flight by 10:30AM). That was over a week ago now and my partner and dog stayed at our house because our dog sitter happened to be traveling the same week as well. My grandma has been transferred to hospice care and they\u2019re almost positive she\u2019s going to pass today. This is is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. I\u2019m staying at her house, every night by myself, in her bed, really have no one talk to and my partner can\u2019t fly out for reasons above (his parents are traveling in Europe right now so there\u2019s literally no one to take care of our dog). I\u2019m so deeply depressed and alone and all I want is to go home and mourn in my own space. I\u2019m not close with my parents, they were abusive and my sister is only 10 so I\u2019m quite literally alone. No matter how much I want to go home, I\u2019m not going to even though it\u2019s going on a week and a half of being here, I need to be here to say goodbye but no one but my partner understands that being here in causing me a panic attack almost everyday. My grandmother was my person, and being here is breaking my heart but also causing so much anxiety and stress. This probably makes zero sense but I just needed to get it out before I crashed out on someone during this time that I know is hard for other people not just me. I\u2019m just so deeply depressed and want to feel an ounce of comfort and I haven\u2019t and I feel like I\u2019m going insane. ",

        "text": "hello, i need some advice. a culmination of things, building consistently over the 20 years that my parents have been married, has built to bring them to a point where neither are happy in the relationship anymore, but especially my mom. there has been constant instances of disrespect from my father, be it anything from flirting with female coworkers in front of her, to directly insulting her appearance, to emotional manipulation, gaslighting and clear narcissism. i\u2019ve seen it happen my whole life, but as i\u2019ve gotten older, i notice it more and take note of just how terrible the things that my father does and says are. the smart answer would be to leave him, yes, but he\u2019s the main provider for our family and she doesn\u2019t currently work, she\u2019d lose everything if they were to split right now. she has been working on turning our property into a nature preserve and she\u2019d lose all of the progress with that as well, and making that happen means the world to her. she\u2019s already lost endless opportunities, levels of confidence, time, and effort to him, it\u2019s simply not an option right now. she\u2019s actively looking for jobs but her confidence is so low, she\u2019s struggling so bad with depression and sleep deprivation, she can barely eat, and is overrun with stress. getting her to a point where she can leave him and start a life for herself where she\u2019s happy is a slow process in the making, we\u2019ll get there, i just want advice on how i can help her now. does anybody have any tips to helping her earn her confidence back, get some sleep, or any way i can help her feel seen and loved and confident again until she can leave my douchebag father? it\u2019d be greatly appreciated. my heart breaks everyday for her because i feel powerless to help her. \n\nTLDR; how do i help my discouraged mom feel better about herself?",

For example:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not listening to me!\u201d \n\u201cIm just pacing around. It doesn\u2019t mean Im not listening to you.\u201d \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.

I forgot to change it (I have no idea why I forgot to change it at all when I could see in big letters bitchy ass hoe whenever she calls or texts). \n\nSo yeah. She saw that contact name and she screenshotted it and sent it to her boyfriend and saved it in her photos and she started crying telling me to get out of her room. I tried asking her if we could talk before she goes to work but completely ignores it. All I need is one moment to where she agrees with me to talk to her so that I can validate her emotions and tell her how truly sorry I am and that I\u2019ll never do it again. But Im worried that she won\u2019t let me talk to her and I don\u2019t know what to do if she doesn\u2019t. Im also scared that she sent it to the rest of my family, meaning the rest of my family will bash me for it. \n\nWhat should I do? ",

Secondly, you have to commit to changing the way you treat her, even if she is being ridiculous. All you can control are your own actions, and she has to see the error of her ways in order to change herself.  \n\nFor what it is worth, you seem like a genuinely loving teenager who made a normal mistake. Don't let this situation define you, or denigrate how you see yourself. Just do the next 'right' thing, and learn from this situation!  This will blow over, especially if you apologize.",

        "post-author": "TrueStrawberry1426",
        "text": "A little backstory. My sister and I were roommates from the time I was 17 until I was 24. \nShe found herself in a relationship \u201csituation\u201d where she became pregnant.  The dad was not in the picture. He was \u201cseparated\u201d from his wife who he \u201cwas leaving\u201d\u2026.and didn\u2019t want her to have this baby (plot twist we all saw coming but her\u2026. He never was separated and never was planning to leave his wife)\nI was in the delivery room when she gave birth to my nephew. I cut his umbilical cord. She worked long hours and weekends. I did not. I was 21 years old and instead of hanging out with friends I was taking care of my nephew. I used my paycheck to help pay for bills, groceries, and anything he needed. He was like my own. His dad would come visit for an hour every couple of months, throw some hand me down clothes at him and head back home. It was years before my sister finally got the nerve to take him to court for child support. When my husband and I moved in together my nephew came and did sleepovers with us every other weekend. He spent a lot of weekends and evenings hanging out at our house. My husband was the first real father figure in his life. He played ball with him, we took him to baseballs games, they played video games together, taught him how to play poker, card games, etc. we maintained that relationship all throughout the years. My sister made a lot of bad choices and they lived with us at least 3 times over many years. He was my oldest son\u2019s first best friend.\nFast forward to  age 19, my nephew would see his dad maybe once a year at a holiday event he was asked to come to, but mostly he would go months without hearing from him. My sister was his everything. She passed away unexpectedly 3.5 years ago and my nephew came to live with us (because where else would he go)?He never had a job, never finished high school, never learned to drive. He sat in his room and played video games all day and night. \nWhen he moved in, we started the road to helping him get his life together. Made him go back to school, get his GED and enroll in college, he got a job, got his license, and started saving money. He lived with us for 2.5 years and then got his first apartment. We moved him in helped him furnish it, get settled. He met a girl. They eventually moved in together and are now expecting their first child. Not how I wanted things to go, but they are both being very responsible about it. Suddenly his new step-mom (who his dad married years ago after he got caught cheating with her by his former wife) is all in on being involved in his life. A woman my sister hated. A woman who never showed any desire to be a part of his life or help in any way until my sister died. His father still isn\u2019t super involved, most communications are from his step mom. I\u2019m happy they are finally stepping up and showing interest in his life at the age of 23. He is happy to get to know his dad better and his half siblings and step siblings. But now, it seems she has a mission to be a best friend to his girlfriend, and despite my husband and I including them in everything, they are allowing it. She found out the gender of their baby before we did- that hurt. I told him it did, and he understood and was apologetic. I just feel like she is trying too hard to insert herself into his life as a mom. It makes me ill. I think of my sister and how she would feel and I get so sick thinking about it. \nI ask him about throwing a baby shower for them and he tells me his step mom is already doing it and both his girlfriend\u2019s family and their families are all attending that one. Again, I was shocked. We weren\u2019t included at all, but we did get a Facebook invite last week to attend. I just can\u2019t in good conscience go to this. I don\u2019t want to. This is all wrong. \nI\u2019m just trying to figure out if this is me being selfish after all we have done and continue to do for him, yet his dad (or stepmom) who hasn\u2019t been around is suddenly trying to take over the role my husband and I have filled for so many years. I\u2019m also always thinking about what my sister would think (but I realize she isn\u2019t here to voice that)I\u2019m worried about not going, because of what he will think, but the idea of being a guest also makes me sick. I literally don\u2019t know what the right answer is and this is something I would normally go to my sister for help with, the one person who would set me straight. So now, I\u2019m here, asking a bunch of strangers who I have divulged a small piece of the story to, hoping you can give me advice and withhold some of the judgement. \n",

        "text": "I just got married last month and prior to the wedding and everything in between, my two younger siblings were not supportive and caused a lot of turmoil on top of all the stress I had while planning. \n\nFor starters I asked my middle brother to be my man of honor and let me just say in a few words that he was the WORST! He basically did nothing, made it all about himself and even admitted before my bachelorette that he was purposefully being petty because of how annoying I was. I had to beg him multiple times to look things up and never lifted a finger (that\u2019s why I was annoying according to him). So I basically booked, planned and was the direct person of contact. And no I had no bridesmaids. But he failed me because I did communicate to him that his duties were to plan and alleviate some wedding stress with the bachelorette. \n\nBoth of my brothers did complain a lot about why I was having a destination wedding and literally made my life hell because one of them almost didn\u2019t show up because I was \u201cinconsiderate\u201d to him and his girlfriends schedule. I was upset because all the times that I have been the first one to go out of my way to travel for celebrations, graduations, and even helping them move out, really stinged because I have always been that older sister that will make a sacrifice knowing that I have things to handle but I will compromise for family. \n\nAnywho moving forward to wedding week, \nboth of them complained for different reasons once again. According to them: the hotel wasn\u2019t nice enough (mind you it was a 5 star all inclusive resort in Costa Rica), going to my wedding was a waste of time, I wish I would have only stayed one night at the resort, destination weddings are dumb, and etc. The comments they made were super hurtful and rude. \n\nMy brother that was MOH, had a nasty attitude during the rehearsal dinner and on the wedding day my cousin and husband heard his comment how he was pissed that all the attention was on me\u2026and made it all about himself. The cherry on top was his speech\u2026both my husband and I were embarrassed. He put no effort and was not even heartfelt. He basically thanked me for allowing to bring his friends and yeah\u2026.WTF!!!!! \n\nSide note: we think my brother is undiagnosed with bipolar disorder and shows a lot of narcissistic traits. \n\nHonestly my blood was boiling. I am in disbelief and disappointed with them. \n\nNow moving to my mother who was the most supportive during my entire wedding season is having a difficult time with understanding my POV. I had clearly told her that I was going to distance myself from my siblings and things were going to change after the wedding just to keep the peace. She is saddened by this and wants me to like move forward and be happy go lucky with them. \n\nIt sucks that as an adult she won\u2019t respect my feelings and how I deal with the situation. I have yet to talk to them but I have been really hurt and upset to even confront them just yet. \n\nShe even tried to push me to wishing my toxic dad a happy Father\u2019s Day next month\u2026who I also cutoff because of his hurtful comments on why he didn\u2019t support my marriage or wedding. He also did not come to my wedding. And in her defense it\u2019s about doing the right thing\u2026\n\nI feel like this toxic positivity is killing me & she just doesn\u2019t get it\u2026.\n",

He does nice things for me, such as paying for my braces, school fees, and letting me use his things for music (cause I play guitar), but he also has a major over-arching control of my life. I'm not allowed to go out of my house without a parent, have to have all these trackers on my phone, can't go to friends houses or anything like that, I have to, in detail, explain exactly what I'm going to do whenever I do something with my friends (which is basically never now), and he sometimes beats me (his lifestyle is \"you earn respect through fear\"). He also doesnt believe in depression and whatnot and wont let me take my anti-depressants or see a therapist cause \"real men dont need help\". I don't know whether I should try and move in with a friend or move out as soon as i can afford it and cut him off, or keep him in my life for the things he does. Any advice?\n\n(BTW I live in Australia if it helps)",

        "text": "Last year my (34M) (soon-to-be) ex-wife (28F) had basically left me for another man after we were together for almost 9 years. She left me with our 3 kids (8m, 6m, 4f) along with all the financial responsibilities of being a parent and a homeowner. She had moved in with her new boyfriend and lived about 5 minutes away but wasn't seeing the kids often. Just recently she moved to a town about an hour away and I've been looking for a new place as well. My ex has suggested I could move closer to her so that she could see the kids more often and she would also have them overnight when I work. This would help me with childcare as I don't have any other help should I move elsewhere. However, with me moving closer to her I'm now moving away from family and friends. I'm not sure if I should just move closer to my ex so that my kids can be with her more and I get childcare or try to stay local where my kids already have established IEPs (oldest and youngest are autistic, go to school through the county and my middle child has ADHD). I just feel stuck at this point. Any advice would be great. ",

        "text": "(I'm not sure if this is actually nsfw (around the third paragraph) but I'm just gonna put a warning jic \\^\\^)  \n  \nSo, before I start\u2014I'm 14 years old (I'm not rlly comfortable in disclosing my gender, srryyy -u-), my aunt is 34-ish, and my cousin (her daughter) 13. Me and her daughter are really close\u2014like super. We've close since we were children and have been like that ever since. The only thing that has been slowly tearing away my relationship with her is her obnoxious, money-hungry, prehistoric, absolutely full of herself mother.\n\nHonestly\u2014without a doubt, I believe that she hates me to my core and I have no idea why. I haven't done ANYTHING to her that I can remember. I've been nothing but obedient and kind to her and her family. Cause, there was this one time when me, her daughter, and our other cousin came over to have a little bonding time, like we'd have a sleep-over and among other things. T'was lunch time, we were done eating and she made a comment about how as three ate so little and that we need to start eating more to achieve a healthy build (in which, I call BULLSHI-) and I just so happen the glance at the clock because we had a show to catch up on and she genuinely scolded me. SCOLDED ME since she thought that I WAS ROLLING MY EYES. Like, you've gotta be kidding me rn. Anyways, before I start ranting about how utterly exasperated I am, I'll start yapping through EVERYTHING she's done that made me think of her this way.\n\nFirst, she yelled at a poor waiter since her son knocked over a bowl of complimentary bread, her excuse was the waiter placed the bowl at the very end of the table\u2014making it fall. Second, she yelled at me and basically hollered about my glasses not having any grade. LIKE\u2014 excuse you, YOU'RE farsighted, I'M nearsighted. You CANNOT just tell me to replace my faultless glasses just because you can't see in them. What? I have to adjust for you??? Get a good grip for Christ's sake. THIRD, I was in the middle of showering when all of a sudden, she just banged on the door and waltzed right on in as soon as I opened it to SHOWER WITH ME. And all she had to state was that we're blood-related\u2014 oh my gosh, STOP. She even playfully commented on my 'parts'. Genuinely, I felt so uncomfortable that I didn't even bother to condition my hair. I just dried myself off and got out. Sometimes, she'd reached out and 'tickle' my 'parts' . ALL IN FRONT OF MY MOM.\n\nAnyways, that's enough ranting for today\u2014the massive hatred in my chest is finally eased and I can sleep happily now. (well, I'm still living with her, so not really\u2014) Oh, did I also mention that she has this intense, RBF? (resting b1tch face). The looks she gives me are almost gut-wrenching ;-;. Anywho, I'm done\u2014thanks for listening!! :>",

        "text": "Hello everyone, my brother used to live with my sister and me at my mother's house for four years. He was in a relationship with a girl, but they weren't married. Few of us got along with that girlfriend of his, my mother always gave him good advice to help him take the right path and not make too many decisions in his life, but he rarely listened to her and followed her advice, such as working, studying, and saving money while he lived with us, and not having to pay so many household bills if he had a life apart.\n\nWhat happened was my brother's girlfriend ended up pregnant unfortunately, something that my sister, my mother, and I suspected was going to happen, but we didn't really know since he decided to move out of the home, and his girlfriend didn't usually come to our house, due to the surprise we were going to have. Well, months later, we found out from our brother, who decided to tell us about his girlfriend's pregnancy, as I said, my brother is quite an womanizer and his girlfriend had caught him with other women, he and his girlfriend had a conflict until they ended the relationship, now he has to pay a lot of child support to his ex-girlfriend, he has to take care of the children, buy her lots of toys and food, in our house.\n\nWell, after that, he found another girlfriend again, who stayed overnight at our home. My mother didn't agree with any of it. He did those things without my mother's knowledge. Only my sister and I knew about it, but we didn't tell her anything. My mother continued to reproach him and give him good advice to change his lifestyle and make good decisions. None of that has worked. The same thing happened now, his current girlfriend is pregnant, not with one, but with two twins. Weeks ago, he moved out of the home again because he knew what he did. It's a totally fucked up situation for him and for us. He's also unemployed, and I feel like he'll need us for financial help and childcare, since his girlfriend works but can't take care of all the utilities and household needs.\n\nI was never able to talk to him to try to convince him to have an abortion, since that's not my life, but it affects me and our family in some way.",

        "title": "I decided to challenge my Mom on homosexuality and really try to figure out what her opinions are and how open to change she may be.",
        "post-author": "Intelligent_League79",
        "text": "Hello, I'm 22 y/o and I come from a conservative Christian household. My parents love and support me but, I'm not out as gay to them and I know that it wouldn't go over well.\n\nMy Mom's views on gay people are paradoxical. She's familiar with gay people, she knows about a few that were at my high school, she knows about gay celebrities and even has favorites, and she doesn't immediately disregard someone for being gay. But, she does judge them heavily, she does call it a lifestyle choice, and she does think that they're probably going to hell.\n\nFor about as long as I've known I was gay I knew there would be a day that I would have to reckon with her attitudes. Last night, my family and I were watching a movie starring Heath Ledger called \"A Knights Tale\". It was a good film. While we were watching it my Dad asked if there was a western movie that Heath Ledger was in, and I laughed out loud because of the accidental reference to Brokeback Mountain. My Dad understood why I was laughing and said \"no no that's not what I meant,\" but we all laughed and thought it was funny. My mom meanwhile was more skiddish, saying \"oh no no not that film,\" and taking a sip of her holy water.\n\nAfter the guests left and my Dad went upstairs to retire to bed, I stayed downstairs with my Mom to ask her some questions. I guess I just felt that I wanted to get to know her position on gay people better. As I explained above, it's always been contradictory seeming with her how she can simultaneously speak kindly about gay people while saying that they're going to hell and she doesn't want kids seeing them.\n\nI asked her about Brokeback Mountain.\n\nShe told me, \"I love Heath Ledger, great actor, but that's the one thing I just don't like about him. I don't like how he's pushing an agenda by being in that film. Live your life but keep it in the bedroom.\"\n\nI responded, \"well, he wasn't forced to do that role, it was groundbreaking at the time and he wanted to do it.\"\n\nShe said, \"I know but it's pushing an agenda, it's satanic it's not good.\"\n\nThe phrase \"pushing an agenda\" is one I'm familiar with. Throughout the 2010s as queer visibility rapidly increased on TV, it became harder and harder for my parents to shield me from seeing that. I remember one instance on \"The Amazing World of Gumball\" a cartoon, where they showed a male and female stick figure running at each other only to miss each other and run into same-sex stick figures while the narrator said \"love is love.\" My mom scoffed and found it disgusting. Ten years ago, there was this one time when we would watch this TV show every Sunday night when it would air, called \"Once Upon a Time.\" It was a really unique and engaging show, like Game of Thrones but for a family oriented audience. One day, they had two female characters that were lesbians. Over the course of the episode they gradually got closer with one another, and my parents started freaking out. My mom talked about them \"pushing an agenda\" with my Dad and I believe one of them shielded my face from the TV as they went to change the channel. My Dad went along with it saying, \"oh they're pushing an agenda.\" Verbosity was never a problem with him. So yes, I am familiar with the phrase \"pushing an agenda.\" It died out over the years and I never really heard it again, until last night when I talked to my Mom about Heath Ledger.\n\nAfter my Mom said that, I walked away calmly. My demeanor with her with these types of conversations has always been, \"christian kid who's curious and just asking questions with barely any challenges.\" When she's getting ready to go to sleep, I decide that I want to challenge her for real and and really try to understand the root of why she's so anti-LGBT.\n\nI walk into her bedroom and start the conversation light. I talk to her about how much I enjoyed the movie and about the ice cream I got earlier which I was super happy about. After that part of the convo dies down, I make my move.\n\nI say, \"Can I ask you a difficult question?\"\n\nShe says, \"Sure.\"\n\nI ask her point blank, \"Why are people gay?\" I supplement my question with an observation about how in the Paul Ruebens documentary that came out recently it's revealed he was gay. PeeWee Herman was a huge character for me growing up as well as my Mom when he was actually huge, so I figured this was a good relatable way to start the convo. She says that she doesn't know; that it could be environmental or related to abuse as a kid; but that it's ultimately just how some people are for some reason. I talk about how there's lots of gay people out there, and we sort of go back and forth listing gay people we know of. Richard Simmons, Liberace, that one guy from my high school, etc.\n\nI ask her if she thinks being gay is a choice. I then bring up the fact that if it's not a choice, it really sucks that these people are being discriminated against and that they can't live normal lives because of others. My mom brings up the Bible, about Soddom and Gamorra and how homosexuality is just not Biblical. She says she has compassion for what these people are going through, but that they need to make the right decisions in front of God.\n\nShe lists off a bunch of sins like murder and stealing and homosexuality. I call this out. I ask her if she really considers homosexuality on the level of murder. Thankfully she says she doesn't and felt bad that I thought she did. Throughout our conversation there were moments where she said something along the lines of \"I don't want this in front of kids\" and it really gave me bad flashbacks to when I was a kid and experiencing that parenting first hand. It was tough. She's pretty dead set in her beliefs, was one of my takeaways. She's less \"hateful\" of gays and more trying to be as Christian as she can. So was Anita Bryant though.\n\nMy Mom holds on to religion strongly because of her upbringing. Needless to say, she had one of the worst childhoods I've ever heard anyone go through. My analysis of our convo was limited because we spent a while talking about her childhood. It was quite a bad one. While she was a victim, she had anger problems as a teenager, did drugs, and she even fought people. As an adult now in her 50s, she holds great regret for her past. She choked up thinking about it. Being biblical and following God is her way of finding peace at this point in her life, especially given her extreme anxiety which has only worsened over the years. I don't fault her for being Christian, and honestly I don't know how she turned out so well after having such a fucked up childhood. That really is a miracle. Many of my biggest faults of my parents are of them being overprotective or sheltering, and while that isn't good, it certainly beats the abusive, violent, absent family that my Mom grew up with.\n\nI exited the conversation with her after we talked about how gay partnerships worked in the 90s. How gay people stuck together as couples despite marriage not being legal. I don't think she understands that gay people have the same wants and desires as straight people though. She seems to still view their visibility and gayness as a perversion, a sexual act, moreso than a couple just being in love. And strangely she would still be against kids seeing 2 guys kissing, just on the principal that it's not biblical. But I also think she's just uncomfortable with the idea of that, not even on a religious basis, but just uncomfortable with it and from a different time when it wasn't acceptable.\n\nMoving forward, I have gained a clearer picture about what my coming out could look like. I think our conversation was helpful. Unfortunately, I think it will be tough, I think that it may even entail a minor religious debate regarding verses. My plan in the short term, is to show her a video that I think could strike a chord. It's a video about this TV show from the early 90s, involving this gay kid who gets kicked out of his family's place and another family that adopts him, has to grapple with their own homophobia. I think that the video hits every note that I'm aiming for in terms of seeing that it's possible for a teenager to be gay, that it's not something someone would choose, and that someone who's unfamiliar/uncomfortable with gay people can come around and gain a new understanding.\n\nLonger term, my plan is to go to therapy and relay what I've written on Reddit (you can scroll through my post history) to a therapist to get their input. Then after these things, and assuming I land a fulltime job with benefits and I'm able to have a steady stream of income, I will try to come out. Because honestly, I keep to myself to maintain my parent's support of me. I don't want secrets and I'm not gonna date anyone without my parent's knowing that I'm gay. I need to do this to be able to come out and live my life.\n\nThose are my thoughts. Gotta love a 3 AM ramble. Thanks for reading!\n\n\\-IL",

        "post-author": "Laurajw12",
        "text": "  \nThis is a sequel to my recent and exceedingly popular article\u00a0[\u201cDo Boomer Grandparents Suck Today?\u201d](https://medium.com/@tabitha.rosen/do-boomer-grandparents-suck-today-68c9afb9af64)\u00a0That post hit a nerve, beyond what I could have ever imagined. So why not piggyback on the topic with another\u2013one that, I believe, is also responsible for the escalating parent-child\u00a0[estrangement](http://www.doormatmom.com/)\u00a0epidemic happening in our nation at-present. I am talking about the lack of mental toughness and mind-blowing self-centeredness so many young parents exhibit today that is leaving zero space for reality and even less for extended family.\n\nThe \u201clife is hard\u201d mentality has gone \u2018next level\u2019, making it appear as if the economic good times ceased in the United States the minute millennials conceived. And with it so did any real consideration for grandma and all that that may entail, including regular visits. The \u2018train of thought\u2019 behind this recent conclusion and behavior is bizarre. It would even be comical if it weren\u2019t so detached, childish, and besmirched with self-importance.\n\nWhat utter lack of respect, awareness, and historical accounting. The indignation is especially stark in light of the wide-ranging contributions and challenges their own parents invariably faced when raising them. One such oblivious Tiktok creator named\u00a0[angerandautism](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTjuTcRQe/)\u00a0spoke to this phenomenon beautifully and added in a touch of resentment to boot. It\u2019s a\u00a0[must-watch video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJ9kubUOL5e/?igsh=MTdnZ3o4czd0dmRsNg%3D%3D)\u00a0that serves to explain but comes across as wildly misguided to grandparents and, ironically, self-deprecating to the creator, himself, and the many that call him king.\n\nThe notion that \u201cit is acceptable to deprioritize significant relatives like grandma and grandpa under the guise of being too busy\u2019 is jarring, insulting, hurtful, and unfathomable. This is especially startling, given how these same two grandparents once prioritized their own parents in combination with their children for the good of both despite the strain it placed on them as well (many during even tougher economic times). Weak-minded and self-centered\u2026that\u2019s how this attitude plays to grandparents who know the struggle and figured it out anyway.\n\nOne such grandmother in her 60\u2019s responded to\u00a0*angerandautism\u2019s*\u00a0video by describing the two working parent household that she raised her own kids in. Both her and her husband labored over forty hours a week each, commuted long hours daily, and completed household chores no different than anyone else at the time. They then drove over an hour away every Sunday to visit their extended family, because they knew it was important. On top of it, she and her husband never made more than minimum wage. When they bought their first home, they did so taking a 13% interest rate on a mortgage, one of the lowest available then. And it wasn\u2019t until her husband died, and she went back to college, did she ever have any real money at all.\n\n*\u201cPeople prioritize what they want to prioritize and the entitlement of today says \u2018we only prioritize ourselves and our own comfort\u2019. Back then we prioritized family, so he needs to stop talking about the problem with old people and delve into what\u2019s wrong with his generation,\u201d*\u00a0she said.\n\nUndoubtedly, raising families during the Great Depression, the Economic turmoil of the 70\u2019s, the Great Recession and several other eras throughout history posed no less challenges than raising families do today\u2013more, actually. The big difference now lies in young parents\u2019 mental and emotional fragility as well as their me-centric priorities and attitudes when it comes to the importance of grandparents and extended family in relation to their own immediate family. Plainly speaking, they do not prioritize grandparents or extended family because they literally \u201ccan\u2019t stand-up to the job\u201d or simply \u201cdo not care to.\u201d\n\nThose wisened by life see this for what it is while others remain naive or fooled. Whatever the case, the one place many grandparents admit their adult kids excel in with regards, currently, is\u00a0**\u201cin making them feel inconvenient and worthless at this point in their lives.\u201d**\u00a0These young parents simply never conquer the turn into \u201cjust because I love you,\u201d like prior generations did\u2013rather, they present as if the word \u201cgrandparent\u201d is synonymous with the word \u201cinterference\u201d and the phrase \u201cgoing out of their way\u201d with the phrase \u201clife sentence.\u201d\n\nIt leaves a sour impression, for certain. Then they wonder why grandma isn\u2019t showing up at their front door with a plate of cookies, wad of cash, and oodles of time to give. \u201cInterruptions\u201d rarely make house calls. And \u201cburdens\u201d find others who do. I imagine, it is the reason mister angerandautism remains so enraged and riddled by his own mother\u2019s behavior. Someone might want to explain it to him, I think.\n\nOriginally Source: [When Was It That \u2018Extended Family\u2019 Became No Longer Worth The Fuss? | by Doormat Mom | May, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@tabitha.rosen/when-was-it-that-extended-family-became-no-longer-worth-the-fuss-4287b147707e)",

Interacting with her is a real joy and maybe something like that might also be in your future. \n\nBecoming a safe and healthy person (mentally) is step one on that journey, and sometimes having a goal can help. \nA traditional family situation might not be in your cards, that's not for me to know, but there are many other unconventional ways of being a family.

This is one reason why neglected teenagers are at risk for underage pregnancy. But as you say, first we have to be stable and healthy before taking on such a responsibility.\n\nI wish you all the best and hope you recover from your conditions if possible.",

Is that temporary or permanent?\nAsk yourself these questions:\n- why do I want to have a baby?\n- do I want someone to love me unconditionally? \n- do I want a baby because I don't want to feel lonely?\n- do I want a baby to take care of someone?\n- do I want a baby because I don't want to be abandoned and want my child to always stay by my side?\n- do I want a baby to give me a purpose in life?\n- do I want a baby because I want to feel I matter and I am important to some else?\n- do I want a baby to feel like an adult (in front of my parents)?\n- how do I picture my live changing if I had a baby? \n- do I want a baby because I want the baby to heal my emotional wounds?\n- do I want a baby because the baby will make me happy?\n------\nWrite the answers down and reflect on them.\n\nHaving children is wonderful but it can come with great emotional challenges. A baby might trigger/remind us of old childhood wounds and grief when we were not loved the way we needed to be loved.\n\nWhen I had my daughter I imagined nursing her would just happen and be a beautiful bonding experience but it turned out to be painful. For my friends it was a special  and they loved it.\n\nMy daughter is a wanted child but it took me a long time to connect and bond with her.  And it turned out it had something to do with my own childhood. My birth was very traumatic and I reminded my mom of the trauma and she couldn't bond with me. She started working full time when I was 45 days old. An aunt took care of me and I saw my tired mom only in the evening but I slept in a separate bed. My aunt did love me but had no experience with children and was undergoing cancer treatment herself. So as a baby I spent a lot of time by myself and with the family cat. I was fed, changed and kept clean but not nurtured.\n\nNow I live in Germany. Here, many moms stay at home with the baby at least for one year and if they have a second baby they stay up to three years at home. For that period of time, moms receive monthly up to 60% of their last paycheck. Dads can stay at home too. Babies often sleep in a small bed that's attached to their parents bed. This gives the children and families the time to bond and create emotional stability.\n\nI went to therapy for two years and realised children cannot replace what we did not receive emotionally when we were young. We actually have to learn to give something we didn't receive as children (and that can be painful). We have the responsibility to fulfil the emotional needs of our children and not the other way around.\n\nMy mom loves me and I love her as well and now we have a good relationship. However she is emotionally dependent on us (adult) children - we are four. And she was when we were young as well. And that was too much responsibility, for me at least.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, having a baby doesn't happen in an empty environment. A child is born into a family system (and possibly trauma that can be transferred).\nAnd that means of course that we as adults are part of a family system that shape us and influence us.\n\nI'd suggest reading about IFS, internal family systems, e.g. \"No Bad Parts\" by Richard Schwartz and \"Are you ok?\" by Kati Norton - I loved this book (I actually listened to it). Check out Gabor Mat\u00e9 on YouTube, he's written several books as well. \n\nI also recommend the book \"Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents\". However I'd recommend reading this book while you are on therapy because it might unpack many things and a therapist could help you understand and process them.\n\nAnd last but not least I agree that getting a pet could be a good option :).\nI have a cat \ud83d\ude3a.\n\nBest to you!",

I don't think anyone should have a baby just because you \"want\" one, babies are going to grow up to be a full person with a belief system and you want to make sure you're in the best circumstances to support one mentally and physically.",

        "text": "I'm a 20-year-old male in college. But there's a lot going on at home that's weighing me down.\n\nMy parents have been married for 21 years, but they never truly wanted to be together. My mother says she was tricked into marrying my father by his brother-in-law. My father, however, was eager to marry her at the time\u2014but eventually, he too became unhappy. When I was younger, they hid their fights from me, but by the time I was in Class 7 or 8, the arguments became loud and constant. Both of them have threatened to leave the house multiple times, and I've had to beg them to stay.\n\nWe aren't well-off financially. My mother comes from a fairly wealthy family. My father, on the other hand, comes from a very poor background. My grandfather (dad\u2019s side) was a victim of the Bangladesh-Pakistan separation. His family had no money\u2014my grandmother used to collect leftover vegetables from the market to feed the family. My father couldn't study beyond 12th grade. He started a business, married off his four sisters (most of his money went to dowries), and managed to keep things stable for a while.\n\nThen came COVID. We lost everything. For nearly two years, we survived on just boiled rice. We had to sell our house, which was under a loan. After clearing the loan, we moved into a rented home and eventually bought a plot of land\u2014again with help from my maternal grandfather. We built a small house there, mostly funded by him. While the house is legally in my mother's name, the land was paid for by my father.\n\nNow, about their relationship: my father is 18 years older than my mother. She feels trapped with an old man. She wanted to work, but her father didn\u2019t allow it. After marriage, my father said she didn\u2019t need to work since he was earning well. She agreed. But over the years, my father's family and his business partner humiliated her multiple times. She carries a lot of resentment.\n\nI suspect my mother may have had an affair. Back in Class 6, I came home from tuition and found her in a dark room with an old male friend. They were startled when I walked in. Later, I saw messages between them\u2014friendly but also romantic. This made me suspicious. My mother says my father also has an affair, and she believes that if she dies, he\u2019ll marry that woman.\n\nRecently, she had a serious surgery. Despite that, the fights have continued. She's repeatedly told my father to leave the house. While from the outside it may seem like my mother is the villain, the situation is deeply complicated on both ends.\n\nWith everything happening, I no longer feel like I belong in this house. It doesn't feel like home. I'm not financially stable yet, but I think in a year or so, I could find my footing and move out.\n\n\n---\n\nWhat should I do? I\u2019m exhausted and torn between holding everything together and building a life for myself.\n",

        "text": "Hi, I\u2019m 33 and my sister is 34. I recently blocked her because I reached my limit. She constantly brags, competes, and finds subtle ways to put me down. She works two jobs, makes six figures, and recently moved to a state I\u2019ve always dreamed of living in not to support me or share in the dream, but to do it first and then rub it in.\n\nI\u2019m currently in school to become a therapist something I\u2019ve been deeply passionate about. She\u2019s a licensed social worker, but now she\u2019s going around telling people she\u2019s a therapist, which she\u2019s not. What bothers me most is that she\u2019s always said she doesn\u2019t like therapy and would never be a therapist. But suddenly, now that she knows it\u2019s my goal, she\u2019s calling herself one. It honestly feels like she just wants to say it to beat me to it or claim credit for something that\u2019s never been hers to begin with.\n\nShe even competes over small things, like saying she saw a show or heard a song first  always needing to be \u201cfirst\u201d or \u201cbetter.\u201d And when I lost my job recently, instead of being supportive, she went on about her jobs and how great things are going for her. It made my anxiety even worse.\n\nMy mom insists she\u2019s \u201chumble,\u201d but I see through it. When I was working as a crisis counselor, she made comments like, \u201cWhen I was on that lower level, I used to do XYZ\u2026\u201d like the work I was doing didn\u2019t matter or wasn\u2019t enough. She always positions herself as the one who\u2019s leveled up and looks down on what I\u2019m doing.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t stop there. When I don\u2019t cook much or talk about dating, she throws in things like, \u201cMen would think I\u2019m the best cook ever,\u201d as if she\u2019s always trying to one-up me in every area of life. Another crazy example she even tries to compete with the most stupidest things like I can say I had a bad day she\u2019ll say her day was worse or if I say I was diagnosed with eczema she\u2019ll say her skin condition is worse. It\u2019s like she wants to top anything even bad things.\n\nThe part that really gets to me, though, is how she always tells the same story about being a teen mom who overcame everything and uses it to say that nobody else has an excuse. I\u2019ve told her before, \u201cThat was your experience you can\u2019t apply your journey to everyone else\u2019s,\u201d but she doesn\u2019t care. She just wants to make it seem like she\u2019s done more, survived more, and deserves more.\n\nThe final straw was her moving to the state I\u2019ve talked about for years. I didn\u2019t want to hear her call me and brag again, so I blocked her not to be dramatic, but to protect my mental health. She makes me feel like I\u2019m always in competition with her, even when I\u2019m just trying to live my life.\n\nWas I wrong for cutting her off? I just couldn\u2019t take the constant comparison, the subtle jabs, and the way she tries to claim everything that means something to me  even things she said she didn\u2019t care about until I did. TLDR",

Let me challenge you to re-think your reaction. If she is bragging - then isn\u2019t she really insecure or jealous ? People who are confident in themselves do not need to brag. So why are you not flattered that she is taking your ideas ? I suspect her life is not as great as you think.  Every time she brags, just smile and say \u201cthank you for reinforcing my life choices\u201d.\n\nThe other things you need to work on - is your lack of confidence. Why are you bothered by her ? Are you thinking that you are not good enough ? You need to work on your own acceptance and happiness in your life choices. Once you have that, then you won\u2019t be affected by her bragging. No need to retort back or complain - just ignore her.",

One of my friends from uni (we have group chat) has that syndrome. It seems she always has to be the one who knows it all.

I have lived in 2 different countries for the past 20 years. I can tell in good authority that what she said was inaccurate.This kind of behavior comes from something lack inside her. In my friend's case, being the forgotten black sheep kid in her family with narcissistic mother. There is something inside your sister brain, but limiting contact is appropriate for me if it helps you protect your sanity. You can play therapists with clients that actually pay you.",

I think you may intimidate her a bit as you\u2019re doing so many successful things she has to compete to feel better and more relevant. Does she do this to friends and other family? You mention she was a teen mum? Could it be that this experience has made her feel self conscious, and somehow less than others? \nI think if this makes sense it could be quite simple to make changes.  Next time she does it, look her in the eye and honestly tell her you\u2019re really proud of how far she\u2019s come. \nHer saying things like men love her for cooking etc I think is her desperately trying to show her importance , she\u2019s even followed your idea of moving to the state you want, not to compete but I think she has no real sense of what she should be doing and following your ideas. I\u2019m not doubting your frustration whatsoever. \nI had a BF years ago who I was very insecure around, I talked about myself a lot . Not in a narcissistic way but in a way I desperately wanted his approval and attention. It would annoy the heck out of him and I didn\u2019t realise I was doing it. He turned out to be a DH and I grew my confidence and moved on. \n\nJust some thoughts",

Spent my life trying to compete with them for my mother\u2019s love, complete waste of time and life. After having my daughter, I realised what true love actually was and made the decision to cut them off to protect not only my mental health, but my child\u2019s wellbeing and mental health too. I\u2019ll start by saying do not be confused by what you see on the exterior. All that glitters is NOT gold. People who brag to this extent are doing so because they are deeply insecure and seeking some form of validation that they ARE good enough, that they ARE worthy. She is very clearly threatened by you and very clearly jealous. Do you have children? I don\u2019t think you do. Only reason I say this is because regardless of what she earns, what state she lives in, etc etc, you have a type of freedom that she will never have again in her entire life. She likely feels like her youth was \u201cstolen\u201d from her because she had to be responsible from a young age. Her decision btw, so idk why she expects sympathy. So when she looks at you, high achiever, not yet with child and FREE, it irks something deep inside of her. I would even go as far as to say that it\u2019s something that she probably can\u2019t control. And now that you\u2019ve cut her off, she\u2019ll 100% be going through a withdrawal of sorts because YOU were her \u201csupply\u201d. You made her feel better about herself. Now that she has nobody to brag to, or nobody that gives a damn, I can only imagine the downward spiral that\u2019s about to take place. You\u2019re well rid and I\u2019d steer clear if I were you.",

Our families are not super close or anything but were all friendly and they are just such a sweet and loving family. I would truly be honored to help out with literally anything. I will definitely offer to walk their dog, mine are injured anyways so that could be nice for all; also will offer to watch their other kids if ever needed. I am thinking about giving a $100-200 Doordash giftcard as well, thoughts on this? Maybe some flowers to go with it.",

The one thing you want to be careful about is coming across too strong (that sounds negative but I don't mean it that way at all, I promise!).\n\nI mention this partly because you don't know them too well and also they've just gone thru the worst thing possible in this life.   They will never fully recover from this.  The other reason is my own experience.\n\nMy mom died when I was 21, a week before I was due to go back to college.  Of course it was horrible, but I ended up so stressed by all the things people kept offering that I didn't want.  One person I can't stand offered to drive me back to school.  I mean, it was nice but 8 hours in a car with her?  Uh, no lol.  What meant the most to me was my bestie saying \"I have no idea what will help, because I've never gone through this.  Just know that whatever you need from me, I've got your back\".  \n\nI love the Doordash idea, but $200 seems a bit excessive.  Maybe get a $100 card, some flowers and also write down your contact info.  Then just tell them you have free time and you'd love to help them out if they want and need it.  Casually mention ideas like babysitting, dog walking, transportation, pretty much anything they think would help.  What you're doing here is trying to let *them* decide what they need.",

I can't speak to what's normal where you live.\n\nWhat I can say is, it sounds like you're dealing with a trust issue.  Why not talk to your wife about it?  Or, better yet, ask her if you can shop with her next time?  You'll get a taste for what it's like and how much things cost, and, hopefully, a better understanding of the work your wife does for the family when she goes shopping.\n\nMoney is a difficult topic in most families.  It's been an off-and-on struggle in my household as well.  If you're stressing over money, talk to your wife in a time of calm.  Tell her how you feel and explain that you see the outcome of her supermarket trips and it stresses you out.  Maybe the two of you can put together a budget.  Maybe you can plan specific foods and have a list ready with expected costs on it.  There are plenty of things you can do together to ease that anxiety.\n\nI still like just asking to join her best, though.  Get some appreciation for how much things cost, and spend some time with your wife.",

We\u2019re hoping to confirm whether his late brother is actually my biological father.\n\nThe man listed on my birth certificate has never been involved in my life (no relationship, no support, nothing). So for me, this test feels like I\u2019m finally facing the truth: I either have a dad who died before I could meet him\u2026 or a deadbeat who chose not to be in my life.\n\nI\u2019m nervous, emotional, and honestly a little scared of what the results could mean for how I see myself and my past.\nHas anyone been through something like this, testing with a relative to try and piece together paternity after someone\u2019s passed? What helped you while waiting for results? And how did you cope if the outcome wasn\u2019t what you hoped for?\n\nAny thoughts, advice, or shared experiences would really help. I don\u2019t have a lot of people in my life who can relate to this.\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "text": "Hi, I need help. My 5yo has always been a happy easygoing temperament - a bit sensitive and stubborn yes, but generally a delightful and happy child since birth - most people described him as \"chill\" when he was a toddler. \n\nSince his baby brother was born in Feb however, it's like he's had a personality change. He's aggressive and we can barely ask him to so much as put his clothes on without having a huge fight over it.  He goes into a state that we call \"the Dark Cloud\"; his face screws up into a gigantic scowl, body clenches right up, refusal to engage, hits and kicks out if you physically try to approach you. When he does talk, it's usually to say that he doesn't like our tone of voice (this is despite ensuring that we don't sound impatient or frustrated), that he doesn't WANT to put socks on (even if we point out that it's necessary to get to where we need to go, which includes places he really wants to go to, such as a playdate or party).  There are also instances of conduct that he simply knows is wrong (e.g. painting someone's clothing).\n\nMost worrying is that it's affecting his school experience - he's had dysregulated moments there too like yelling at his classmates or throwing bark at them. He once kicked out at a teacher when she tried to discipline him for his dysregulated behaviour. It seems that any direction, no matter how reasonable or criticism (e.g. attempts to explain why his behaviour is not ok) is off the table as he'll go into Dark Cloud mode. \n\nWe know it's been a huge year for him - he started primary school as well as having this intruder in the house taking up all our attention and energy. But we don't know how to break out of it. It's getting worse and worse and we feel that we are walking on eggshells.  Some people have suggested it's \"attention seeking\" behaviour and that we shouldn't pay attention to it, but it's not so much the active behaviour that is occurring, but also the resistance to basic, everyday things and refusal to be disciplined that is really wearing us down.",

        "text": "My dad married my stepmom when I was 6ish, and she was extremely cruel to me until I moved out. My childhood and adolescence was really tough, I never really had a safe place to go and was constantly grounded, cleaning, writing lines and other punishments. I remember being grounded once for folding the towels square instead of rectangle lol. Until recently I chalked it up to being her parenting style. My dad? He just went with it. We were super close when I was young but now in my mid-20s I couldn\u2019t tell you the last time he even texted me. Today, their kids are all teens are experiencing the loving home that I never got. I don\u2019t think any of them have ever been grounded like I was constantly. I can\u2019t help but feel like my stepmom\u2019s goal was to isolate me so she could have her own family. I moved out on my 18th birthday and ever since she\u2019s been this fake nice to me. She invalidates it when I bring up anything about how they treated me and says things like \u201cI\u2019m sure it felt like that\u201d. Anyways, how do I deal with this as an adult? It hurts pretty bad accepting that my dad chose her over me in the end. Somehow it hurts even more watching my siblings have the life I never got. None of them have the emotional maturity to even recognize or acknowledge how I was isolated and just make jokes about forgetting I\u2019m blood related to them. ",

Somewhere along the way, I decided that I didn't want to be like that.  I have the satisfaction of knowing that I did better, and that's important!\n\nNot all of us are fortunate enough to be born to two loving parents.  I was glad when my childhood was over.  Are you?  I get that.  The good news is that your childhood is over.  We can put that behind us now.  I put my focus forward and told myself to stop looking back.  The past is gone.  It was what it was, and no one can change that.  Ashes to ashes.  Dust to dust.  \n\nShrugging my shoulders ... I started praying and reading the Bible.  It taught me to forgive them.  That healed my heart considerably.  We don't forgive for their sake.  We forgive for our own sake.  I know it sounds odd, but it's true.  Ditch all that horrid garbage.  Now it will pop up in your head from time to time, but dismiss it as quickly as you can.  It won't do you any good or bring you any peace, and you need peace now.  \n\nYou have a new life now.  It's up to you now.  Step forward, focus on the future, and work hard to make it what you want this time.  We didn't get what we wanted as children.  It is our decision now though!  Make the very best of it that you can ... For You, for your kids in the future, for your spouse in the future.  \n\nI have more good news.  God favors people like us.  He takes compassion on us and helps us out.  In my darkest hours, He was there and made a way when it didn't look like there was one.  He specializes in what looks like impossibilities.  He will send the right person your way.  Recovery is hard work, so we have to try hard to make it right from here on out.  Praying for you right now.",

It\u2019s not like my mom forced it on me, but she definitely leaned on me and I didn\u2019t say no. She\u2019s always put work before us, and she\u2019s not really present when it comes to things like keeping up with him or using tech. So I\u2019m the one checking his location, and when he sneaks out, she calls me to ask where he is. That makes me more anxious, like I have to always know what he\u2019s doing or where he is. Honestly, I almost wish I didn\u2019t know, because her anxiety just ends up becoming mine. He hangs out with bad crowds and has already gotten into a lot of trouble. We weren\u2019t close growing up, but I care a lot\u2014probably too much\u2014because I don\u2019t want him to ever feel the way I felt: alone. I think there\u2019s a deeper fear I have about what could happen to him. And with the military stuff, I\u2019ve gotten kind of obsessed with it because it\u2019s the first thing he\u2019s shown real interest in. It feels like his way out. And it feels like I\u2019m somehow responsible for making sure he makes it. I\u2019ve tried grounding exercises and breathing techniques, but I still check his location constantly, chase him down, and carry the stress. I don\u2019t want to live like this. I want to live my own life, but I don\u2019t know how to let go. If anyone has advice or insight, I\u2019d appreciate it.\n\n",

In college, he went through extreme depression and his social anxiety came to an all time high. He had been coping with weed and alcohol but ended up having to drop out for a year. During this time, I think I felt resentful towards him bc of his drunk driving and throwing away my parents money basically by flunking out of school and lying about it. I don\u2019t think I was as supportive as I could have been. We ended up living under the same roof for several months during Covid and barely talked. I\u2019m not sure how much blame to put on myself as it\u2019s not like he has reached out and I\u2019ve ignored his efforts. If anything he ignores my texts now. But I can\u2019t help but feel confused about why we aren\u2019t close as adults and look back at that time and feel I could have been more supportive. I also struggle with social anxiety but have maintained lifelong friendships and feel I am a lot more high functioning.

I always feel so weird when people ask me how he is and I really don\u2019t have much to report on other than what my mom tells me. We don\u2019t live in same city so it\u2019s hard to work on our relationship without consistent in person touch points. I feel like I don\u2019t even know him. This haunts me sometimes bc I get scared he\u2019s lonely as he doesn\u2019t socialize, but yet he doesn\u2019t continue the convo over text when I reach out. Any advice or words of wisdom/comft? ",

Hes going through his own struggles, no one turns to substances cuz they make them feel good, he has his demons. He doesn't have anything against you. I wish I had more time, with my brother. He passed away young 33. Very similar story.",

He raped his granddaughter, and she showed us that he bought her lingerie and that she stopped going over to his home on the weekends because of him molesting her, and when she admitted this, my uncle tried to kill himself. The police are doing an investigation to see if he is a pedophile, and I believe he is. Why would someone buy an 11-year-old girl lingerie and then claim that he didn't rape her and then say he's innocent after an attempted suicide?",

That make speak up at the very least watch their behavior when this story is taken place to see if they do it act weird around the conversation, ie: asking to be excused to go to the restroom? Maybe figitty, trying to change the faulty subject for gear of sometime finding out.  tell signs . If they do then pull em aside later that ay from anyone else this will ensure more comfortableness  if it is less then so many people before 6 bring it up again but to her directly, it is a sensitive issue  I would advice if you are a man trying to get the truth out bring another person with you a women someone she knows trust, looks up to  etc.\n. This will give her security she would want to feel from. Both of you have the assistance of help and love that she is not alone,. Tell her it's them why you are there and liked to know ....  allow her or them sone time to speak. \nThis also gives you both adults protection against n he said . Plus more. Anyhow next to you all.",
