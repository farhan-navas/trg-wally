        "text": "Not gonna lie, I didn\u2019t think this was how tonight was gonna go.\n\nWe\u2019ve been together almost three years. And yeah, there\u2019ve been fights who doesn\u2019t have those? But tonight hit different. Like, what even is this relationship\u201d kind of different.\n\nSo here\u2019s what happened: I got home from work, just dead tired. Tossed on some sweatpants, reheated leftovers, and hopped on my PlayStation to unwind for a bit. Nothing major just a couple rounds with the boys. She comes in, sees me playing, and immediately starts going off about how I care more about the game than her.\n\nMind you, I\u2019ve only been on for like 25 minutes. I told her, Babe, give me 10 more and I\u2019m all yours.\n\nApparently, wrong answer.\n\nShe snatches the controller out of my hand, yanks the console off the shelf (cords still plugged in), and storms into the bathroom. I\u2019m literally mid-sentence like, What are you doing??\n\nThen I hear it.\n\nSplash.\n\nNo hesitation. My PS5 is now soaking in bubble bath and Epsom salts.\n\nAt first I just stood there. Like is this actually happening?\n\nShe\u2019s screaming about how I never listen, how I don\u2019t show affection, how this is why her mom was right. I\u2019m still stuck on the fact that my digital library and saved games are now marinating next to a lavender candle.\n\nHonestly I didn\u2019t even yell back. I just walked out. I\u2019m in my car right now, still processing. Not even mad  just tired. Like really, really tired.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to be patient with her anxiety, with her trust issues, with the fact that she goes nuclear sometimes over the tiniest things. But tonight? It felt like something broke. Not the PlayStation well, that too  but something in me.\n\nAnyway. Just needed to vent. Not sure if this is fixable or if I\u2019m just finally seeing things clearly.\n\nAnyone else been through something like this?",

He was telling me how awful he felt and how it was not the kind of person he'd ever been, just sort of talking it out among friends. And I said something that I still think about to this day. When you choose to do something like that, when he throws her phone, when she trashes his ps5, what it does it make everything else that you were arguing about irrelevant. Now it's about the shit that's broken and the cost to replace it, and you never get a chance to take back being the one who flipped out and broke something. Life is a series of choices. You're judged by the choices you make.",

You feel like you're supporting her in some way but when people use rage on you they are avoiding real engagement on the issue and are trying to scream you into what they want.  Have a zero tolerance policy for this in your life if you don't want it -- partners, friends, parents even.  Your instinct here to leave and disengage to think was spot on.\n\nShe clearly feels she has asked OP for different behavior again and again.  Perhaps she should have broken up over it? They both need to realize there is a compatibility issue at core.\n\nOP:ask her to apologize and replace it.  Her response will tell you a lot.",

Toss this unhinged woman to the streets where she belongs, take her to small claims court if she won't reimburse you for the PS5 (she needs to face consequences for her actions), take what you've learnt about not letting others insecurities become your problem, and Charlie Mike (continue mission) my dude (move on with your life).",

But he completely invalidates her by saying she just has anxiety and baggage. No sense of how he is contributing. He is understandably extremely pissed right now, and they should probably break up, because it sounds like he doesn\u2019t respect her at all.\u00a0\n\nIf you feel like you are just tolerating your partners baggage.

He doesn't get that his girlfriend feels undervalued by him.  I am guessing she has tried to talk to him. \n\nIt wasn't like he went home happy to see her and I think she's feeling this and hurt by it.  \n\nHe seems very blah about his life whereas his girlfriend had a Bubble bath going, full of emotions,  actively wanted to spend time with him.  \n\nJust not a good match. He seems checked out and like she's some burden.\n\nEdit: just bc OP isn't physically harming his girlfriend doesn't mean he's not abusive,  if anything he seems dismissive of her feelings and neglectful. Abuse doesn't always have to be this huge thing.  It can be subtle,  almost invisible and it can be what someone doesn't do as much as what someone does do.  \n\nBut without education or life experience most people probably won't know",

My partner is the same way. The problem is we deserve affection, attention, love, care, and seriously just walking in giving her a hug and a kiss asking how her day was, literally just a 5min convo you probably would get a whole different person standing in front of you. We just want to be treated differently than other girls, ur PS, ur boys, we are NOT on the same level as these people or things and just showing her a bit more attention than ur PS would have had a totally different outcome. I don't agree with her throwing your PS5 into the water, but I totally understand where she's coming from and why she did it! We can only take so much neglect and abuse (sexually, mentally, emotionally, physically) before we just can't take it anymore.\n\nI really hope you take my advice maybe with ur next gf cuz honestly just showing her some attention is literally all we're crying out for. \n\n@KaitiesCloset this hits close to home, but 19yrs, 2 kids and a life we built together isn't worth this bs we're doing to each other. I love you and I hope you take a step back and really see who's been here this whole time. If you leave (again) ii can't make you stay, but it's always been us, ride or die, forever and for always xo",

That is NOT a healthy relationship. \n\nShe clearly has a lot of issues and behavioir control issues for her to just over react so suddenly. \n\nNow I know I hear a lot about guys who spend all their free time on the play stations, and I get that would cause conflict in a relationship if you're not spending time with your partner, but it doesn't like this is what you've been doing, and to be fair even if it was, doesn't give her the right to destroy your property. \n\nYou also had only been on it for a short time and said you'd come off in 10 mins. If her bath was ready, you'd have finished by the time she came out of her bath, or simply played till she came out the bathroom. \n\nFirstly, I'd grab some of your stuff and go stay with a friend or family. \n\nDon't talk about it with her person. You need this in text messages so you have evidence of her admitting to destroying your property. \n\nSo go pack some things, refuse to talk to her if she tries apologising or wants to talk. Just ignore her and tell her you can't talk about this right now and need some space. \n\nThen she'll likely start texting to appologise, or make excuses for what's he did. \n\nThis is when you make sure its clear from the texts that she grabbed your play station and controller in anger and dumped it in the bath. \nSo if she says something like \" I'm so sorry sorry for what I did, I just got so angry at you playing on there again instead of giving me any time or attention, I just saw red and got so mad I just reacted without thinking. I'm so sorry, etc etc.\" \n\nAs she hasn't spelt out what she's done,you reply by saying... \n\n\"You can't just say sorry and expect it to be fine and forgiven. I literally just got home, you were upstairs, and I jumped on the PlayStation for 10/20 mins while I was alone. You then stormed in, angry I was on it, and I said I'd come off it in 10 more minutes. Which would have been fine if you went to take your bath. But instead you got so angry, you ripped my PlayStation from the TV, and dumped it in your bath!!! You literally deliberately destroyed my PlayStation and controller. It costs hundreds of pounds to buy that, plus the controller, and you've destroyed all my saved games and data from all my games that I can't get back!. Something I enjoy that helps me decompress after work, you just completely destroyed it coz you got mad!. How would you like it if I just dumped your phone in your bath and destroyed it, causing you to lose all your photos and texts etc? And the cost of the phone?? How would you feel? \nYou do realise you need to pay to replace everything you destroyed. The PlayStation, the controller, the memory card, and any games I have to pay to replace. You need to replace it all. You've seriously crossed a line and I can't even talk to you right now. How could you do that to me? I said I was coming off in 10 minutes. Why do that to me?? I did nothing to deserve that hatred and anger. \" \n\nThen let her reply. Coz then when she does, she'll basically be admitting to what she did, and if she doesn't pay to replace everything you've lost, you can take her to a small claims court. \n\nSo let her keep texting you, don't speak on the phone, get it all in texts as evidence. \n\nThen if she agrees to pay to replace everything, price up the cost of EVERYTHING she ruined that needs to be replaced, including if you have to purchase games again or anything. And the memory card and controller etc. Then send her an itemised bill by text saying how much it costs to replace. Depending on how much she earns, you can decide how long she has to repay you. If she can give you half this pay day and half the next, then state that. At this point I would say that if she fails to pay it all back, you will be taking her to a small claims court, and she'll have fees to pay and she'll likely end up having your fees added on to her bill too, and if she fails to pay a court ordered debt, you can get an attachment to earnings where the court orders her employer to deduct the debt from her wages before she's paid, and they may not be impressed she has a court ordered debt, depending on what her job involves. \n\nI took my ex to court years ago, and you don't need a solicitor or anything. If it comes to that, you have to send a written 'letter before court' that explains how much she owes you, what for, when it was meant to be paid etc. And you write a new date for payment to be made, and that failure to pay will result in taking her to small claims court, which will incur fees. You send that to her with a signed for delivery so you can screen shot the tracking info that shows she signed and received it. \nThen if she doesn't reply or pay the debt by the date you stated (usually next pay day), then you can fill out the forms for small claims court. Its all online. \nYou include a copy of the letter before court, the signature receipt, print outs of all the text messages about it with her, (I copied them on to an A4 doccument and had approx 3 pics across, and maybe 3 or 4 rows down of each message screen shot on each page. ) Print out all the text messages, and fill out the form, and you send 1 copy to the courts and 1 copy to her, as she has a right to know the evidence against her. \nShe can either admit fault, or if she contests it will go to court. \nThe court hearing was just a man sat behind a desk in an office building. Not like a court room etc. My ex never showed up. But if he had, we'd have discussed the facts with the judge and he then makes his decision, and he would find in your favour. Then he orders her to make payment by a certain date, or split it into a couple of payments. \nIf she fails to make a payment, you can then apply to attachment of earnings, where the court will order her employer to deduct the amounts from her pay. They send the court a cheque and they then then send it to you. \n\nIt actually worked out better for me having an attachment to earnings coz my ex never would have made the payments each month so this way I didn't have to chase him up and him make excuses of being broke. It was deducted before he got paid. \n\nYou can also claim the court fees you pay to be added to her debt, so you can get that money back. \nOnce you know how much you're claiming from her, you can see how much it costs. \n\nFrom the UK gov website, the prices are....\n\nIf youre claiming between \u00a3300.01 to \u00a3500\t=\u00a350\n\u00a3500.01 to \u00a31,000 =\t\u00a370\n\u00a31,000.01 to \u00a31,500 =\t\u00a380\n\u00a31,500.01 to \u00a33,000 = \t\u00a3115\n\nSo if you end up claiming \u00a3900 for eg, it will be \u00a370. \nIf it's \u00a31200 it's \u00a380. \n\nBut don't let her get away with this. Once you've got all the texts of her admitting it, you can then dump her and end the relationship. She needs therapy for her anger issues and likely has some type of mental health issues to react so severely like that.",

But given the comments you've quoted, and what you've mentioned about her going nuclear and having anxiety/trust issues, at the very least she's had shit on her mind that she's not happy about that's been marinating for a lot longer than your PS5 has been in the tub. There's just not enough info here to, like, say what that is, and like, we'd need to know what your communication with her is like, but yeah. There's obviously a lot more going on here. My thumb-in-the-wind armchair psychiatrist take would be that she feels unheard about something - possibly she *feels* like you don't listen/haven't listened to her expressing needs for affection, given what she said - and she may also be venting to her mother who's feeding the fire. But yeah, with just this anecdote it's almost impossible to say what to do from here. I will say, just from what you've put here, I highly doubt that this is something that you're \"just now seeing clearly\" about her. It's probably more likely that you two have been miscommunicating somehow and she snapped tonight; that could mean your literal communication verbally back and forth is...mismatched, I guess, or you have different communication styles, different approaches to conflict resolution, or all of the above. \n\nThings like this don't suddenly just come out of nowhere. It's like a hawk diving on a fieldmouse. Just because the fieldmouse doesn't see the hawk diving doesn't mean it came out of nowhere, it just means that the mouse didn't see it coming. The danger was always there, though.",

It does sound like she isn\u2019t well equipped to prevent lash outs, and she is responsible for regulating those, you shouldn\u2019t be the one responsible for her behaviour. That reaction is very disrespectful and disturbing. But the reoccurrences she hasn\u2019t been able to deal with must have been present in the relationship for a while. People do break down when they\u2019re overwhelmed by something.\n\nI think OP should balance out his subjective experience with some objectivity, for the sake of his growth and ability to manage relationships.\\\nEven if he chooses a breakup, I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge his shortcomings as well. If he was to get in another future relationship, I think it\u2019s fair to want to look for someone more equipped to communicate and address gaps earlier on, but he has to show up the same way. Perhaps he could also look at whether his views of how relationships dynamics cross his boundaries, and what isn\u2019t healthy to keep going through. Has OP been uncomfortable to consult himself on whether this crosses a boundary for him? Has OP been able to address this with her and himself? Has OP been able to genuinely understand her? Not sure, just asking.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso, OP, sorry for your PS, that\u2019s some expensive equipment there, and as a fellow gamer, i know how precious the saves are.\n\nI empathise with you OP, this sounds tiring and stressful, try and be the bigger person and genuinely speak to her calmly. If she can\u2019t, then it\u2019s ok to step out of something that doesn\u2019t work. In my experience, trying to be the bigger person (rising above the situation, choosing to avoid escalating the conflict or engaging in negative behaviours, refusing to engage in a \"tit-for-tat\" mentality, and instead choosing to de-escalate the situation) has built trust within myself that I have a good grip on life and I got my back.",

It's abusive and vindictive... I don't think you should even consider forgiving her.

If she had a problem she could have waited and had that conversation with you. I used to be that person when I was younger (sans the destruction of property) but if she felt this way the only way forward is to have a conversation with your partner about what you expect and make compromises wherever possible and reasonable. If this is something she does often, I think you should leave. For your own safety. If it\u2019s at all possible, maybe put some space between the two of you for a while and think about what you feel and want from this relationship and whether it is working out. Then talk. If you\u2019re afraid of her lashing out, it might help to go somewhere public. It sounds to me she may need professional help and to practice the advice given to her from said professional. You can only do so much for someone without burning out. \n\nI recommend laying out what are expectations. Could it be she got upset you didn\u2019t greet her when you came home? Ask about her day? Just play catch up with her in general? Given that you\u2019re two different people with different expectations, communication is key. What is it she expects from you? What is it you expect from her? Set aside time for yourself and boundaries of when you will spend time together. \n\nIf you choose to keep this relationship, it needs time and a lot of effort from you both. She needs to work at earning your trust from having destroyed something personal. You are the only one who gets to decide how she will do that. Please take care! You do not deserve to have your personal things destroyed by people you love. I hope things go well for you either way!!",

His pc did not work anymore afterwards, he got furious, said I tossed it on the ground purpose to hurt him because I'm jealous of his pc (I didn't and the PC looked fine to me when he left after picking up everything).\n\nI did not care about his things even if I was responsible for any damage, because he didn't care, not once without me exploding first and even then, he didn't put litte to no effort for litte and big things in a relationship, or even the household . But he called me \"dramatic\" \"out of nowhere\" and for no reason treating him like shit after he was such a \"good boyfriend and who want nothing more than to be able to peacefully chill ever day, on my cost.

Damaging somebody's property because you're mad is always 100% fucked up.\n\nOk. I'mma start with what you told us, which is that your gf came in and was already mad and complaining you don't spend time with her. You then proceed to tell her to give you 10 minutes, and -then- she can have you. Do you see what went wrong there? She expressed a need, and you responded by saying, sorry, but these guys/my needs come first. That's probably not the first time you've done that to her.\n\nYou keep mentioning her anxiety and I'm just wondering why she has that or what that has to actually do with anything? We actually don't know anything about gf (or you) other than what supposedly just happened. It's not fair to keep mentioning her mental health struggles while taking no responsibility yourself for what might have caused her to get to this level of anger. \n\nSo....I hope that your takeaway from this is to prioritize making sure your partner is good. We all need to unwind, but I think when your partner is already at that level of frustration, real communication needs to be had and you need to demonstrate that that person is the priority in your life. Not trying to make assumptions, cuz you really aren't giving much other than what she did and what she struggles with.",

Rice is hygroscopic (meaning it draws moisture out of the air) because it's covered in a fine starchy powder from the rice grains rubbing on each other (which is why you have to rinse rice before you cook it if you want to avoid it being really sticky and not have that thin film of \"scum\" on the water). The actual grains of rice are not much more hygroscopic than any other starch, but when you finely divide something (i.e. you increase its surface area by grinding it), that will increase its ability to absorb things (like water from the air) or dissolve in a liquid (which is why finely ground table salt or sugar dissolves in water more quickly than coarse salt or a crystal of sugar, like rock candy). Putting electronics in rice exposes them to that fine starchy powder, and that can really fuck them up - and even with the powder, rice just isn't very hygroscopic. If you rinse the rice off to get rid of that powder, it loses most of its ability to absorb water from the air.",

And I think I'm his only girl FRIEND. I'm gay, I have a wife, I helped him pick out the ring for this girl, move past it. He's like a little brother to me. \n\nHe's been with his girl for 4 years give or take, and we get to talking the other day about how she's going on some \"vacation\" with 3 guy coworkers... So already an immediate red flag there but he just keeps talking. \n\nHe brings up that he personally knows one of them and how this guy had apparently confessed his feelings/continuously flirts with her and I had a plan in mind... \n\nAfter a few drinks, I got his name from my friend and found him on Snapchat....\n\nBasically I catfished the guy as my friend's girl asking if anything happened... Long and short was no..... But... Idk... \n\nApparently a lot of alcohol was had (which she constantly shames my friend for, if he even has a beer which is WILD to me, but that's not the point), a lot of innuendos were said, a lot of touching and shit from both sides... But then there was 1 more message; she got so drunk that she started twerking/grinding on all 3 of these guys....\n\nI don't know what to do. To me, that's still cheating. \n\nShe hasn't told my friend. I know because I asked if he'd heard from her, which then resulted in him telling me he hasn't heard from her in 2 days, which isn't like her at all. \n\nMy wife thinks I should come clean about the whole thing and send my friend the screenshots I took, but I know it would crush him... He's been cheated on, like ACTUALLY cheated on in the past, and I know this would send him to a very dark place...\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated...\n\nEdit: Yes, I know what I did was fucked up, hence the title. I had a few to many drinks and my wife and I are always protective over him. He's had a rough past, which is why he's now in the military and thriving. Trust me, I've caught enough shit from my wife (for good reason) for doing what I did but I don't regret it. He's a very \"traditional\" guy (ask the dad for his blessing kinda thing). As he has told me, cheating is a very thin line for him, for good reason. It can range from physical to emotional since he's very monogamous, and I think that's where I'm caught up in the do I tell him or not. I know it would be a \"pussy move\" but I think I'd rather make a burner email and send the screenshots that way. ",

But there\u2019s also aspects of this concept that don\u2019t hold up. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t vomit and have a headache normally, but alcohol causes that. So not all drunk actions are sober thoughts manifest. I certainly don\u2019t want either of those things to happen either, so not all drunk actions are sober desires.\n\nHowever, by drinking alcohol I might cause these things to happen even though I don\u2019t want them to. Therefore I should carefully consider how much to drink or not drink in order to limit these consequences. As such, I am responsible for what happens as a result of my choice to drink. If what happens - or might happen - could be an undesirable consequence, then I should restrain my drinking in a responsible enough manner to avoid these repercussions.\n\nThere\u2019s also aspects difference between someone having \u201ca few too many\u201d and rattling off some prejudice or wild conspiracy they normally wouldn\u2019t vs. someone being \u201cblackout drunk\u201d and behaving erratically and unhinged.\n\nThere are actual physiological changes to brain waves that happen from alcohol consumption. This isn\u2019t just like opening a lid on a jar; sometimes it\u2019s like smashing a jar on the ground. Now there\u2019s broken glass. Either way things escape the jar, but one way causes cuts and bleeding that normally wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nIn other words, someone has a drink and becomes less subtle and more unfiltered. Someone else has several drinks and becomes physically incapable of rational thought or action. They didn\u2019t have a sober thought about peeing their pants; they did, however, make the choices that got them too intoxicated to control their bladder. They might even say nonsense that randomly pops into their less than functional brain; it might not be an authentic thought, but they are still responsible for what they say and do. \n\nAll that said, if this story is real then everything the girlfriend did crosses lots of major boundaries. I just read your comment and used to think the same way about the other thing, so I wanted to share how my thoughts have changed.",

EVERYONE gets hurt either way. However, here were my steps for the best result...\n\nStep 1. Confront the girlfriend first. Give her a narrow opportunity to confess. Give her a harsh time constraint (within the hour). This at least causes chaos in her camp. It lets her organize only a half-assed story or excuse. Your evidence will be able to disprove this. \n\nStep 2. If she does not comply, then you go to your friend. Share evidence. Keep the focus on the problem at hand. Do not introduce the secondary 'issue' of how you obtained the intel until the first is resolved. (Not an issue in my opinion btw) \n\nImmediate result. Either way, he knows the leak in his boat. He will patch it. \n\nResponse. You anticipate the emotional fallout and prepare to help him heal. Commit to a long-term aftercare plan. Move forward together. Tell him this! Knowing he is not alone in the transition will reduce his resistance for good change. \n\nFuture result. He will find a new girl. With your help, he could learn to still trust women, if they are like you in character. You've used the situation to model that women can be trustworthy in character and detailed care. \n\nAs principle, you seek ways to use the problem to your friend's long-term advantage.",

That\u2019s why this is hitting you so hard. You acted impulsively, yes\u2014but out of protection, not malice. You\u2019ve owned the mistake, and that\u2019s important.\n\n2. The behavior you discovered is a violation of trust. Even if it wasn\u2019t \u201csex,\u201d it involved physical and emotional boundary crossing, especially for someone who values monogamy so strongly.\n\n3. Hiding this won\u2019t protect him long-term. It might spare him pain now, but if he finds out later (especially without knowing you knew), it could hurt worse and damage your friendship. You don\u2019t need to tell him everything\u2014just what\u2019s necessary.\n\n4. Consider how you tell him. Skip the burner email. He deserves honesty, and you deserve to stand behind your decision with integrity. Maybe say something like:\n\n\u201cI saw something that I didn\u2019t expect to, and I struggled with whether to tell you. But I\u2019d rather you hear it from someone who cares about you than find out another way.\u201d\n\n5. Be there when he falls. He\u2019s likely going to spiral\u2014so don\u2019t just drop the truth and disappear. Help him process. Remind him it\u2019s not a reflection of his worth.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nYou\u2019re not a villain here\u2014you\u2019re human, and your friend is lucky to have someone in his corner. Would you like help writing out a message or script for how to tell him gently but honestly?",

        "text": "So last weekend, I was leaving my girlfriend\u2019s house after dinner with her family. Super casual night tacos, a movie, good vibes all around. Her dad and I have always had this polite, slightly awkward relationship, you know? Like, we *nod* at each other and occasionally comment on the weather like we\u2019re both NPCs in the same video game.\n\nAnyway, I was tired, full, and feeling warm and fuzzy after she hugged me goodbye at the door. Her dad walks me out to my car again, super chill. He pats me on the shoulder and says, \u201cDrive safe.\u201d And THAT\u2019S when it happened. Without thinking, I say:  \n**\u201cYou too\u2026 love you.\u201d** \n\nLIKE I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH MY MOM OR SOMETHING.\n\nHe paused. I paused. The air *shattered*. And then, the man smiled, nodded slowly, and said:  \n**\u201cLove you too, buddy.\u201d**\n\nWHAT.  \nI drove off into the night with my soul in shambles.\n\nFast forward to *every* visit since  this man now ends every single interaction with:\n\n\u201cAlright, see you later. Love you.\u201d Sometimes with a wink. Once with a *thumbs up*.\n\nMy girlfriend thinks it\u2019s hilarious. Her mom keeps giving me weird looks. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s messing with me or if I\u2019m now unofficially part of the family in the weirdest way possible.\n\nSo, Reddit:\n\n* Do I own it and say \u201clove you\u201d back forever?\n* Try to phase it out?\n* Have a formal \u201cwe need to talk about the love thing\u201d conversation?\n\nAny advice or similar \u201caccidental intimacy\u201d stories would be much appreciated",

I'm sure even though it was an accidental blurt out it may have meant more to him than you think. If it truly makes you uncomfortable then explain this to him. There's nothing strange about it in most cases though. Some people use those words more freely than others as well, maybe the case here. Regardless though, if you're uncomfortable, talk to him about it. Explain the situation and be openly honest though if you're still going to talk about it. (The honesty will most likely give you brownie points even if the talk doesn't seem to go well.)",

I don\u2019t have any erection issues when I\u2019m with her, but as soon as I pick up a condom, I start losing my erection. I\u2019m a bit nervous also. The same thing happens even during masturbation\u2014whenever I hold a condom, I lose firmness.\n\nI\u2019ve told my girlfriend that I\u2019ve never had sex before, and she was understanding. It helped me release some of my tension. But still, right before penetration, when I try to put on the condom, I lose my erection. Do you think using a drug like Cialis would help? What should I do? I would really appreciate supportive and constructive advice.\n\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m also very nervous since these are my first times. And I\u2019m always think I\u2019m not gonna good enough ext.

Also nothing wrong with the occasional use of an aid like the blue pill. \n\nBut my guess is that the nerves will fade with more practice so if you\u2019d rather avoid using anything to supplement your shared experience then I suggest either throwing on the occasional condom while you\u2019re masturbating. I\u2019ve had condoms on for that before just simply to avoid the clean up. It\u2019ll help create a more subconscious sense of normalcy when it really matters. \n\nMy other suggestion is to talk to your partner about ways that she can help stimulate you while you\u2019re trying to put the condom on. I\u2019ve had partners in the past put the condom on for me and that was definitely hot enough to keep my FULL attention. I\u2019ve had partners stimulate me while I put a condom on. There\u2019s tons of ways that she could be helpful in that specific moment (even verbal stimulation by saying things that you both know to really turn you on) if she\u2019s willing to help and it already sounds like she is. \n\nBest of luck!",

I\u2019ve gotten one and they\u2019re incredibly cheap and easy to get if you are insured. \n\nBut lastly, OP? As someone who has used MULTIPLE brands and types of condoms throughout the years (don\u2019t worry, this ain\u2019t a body count brag lmfao my count is low) I can also attest that the super thin condoms, especially the ones from Trojan definitely do feel different. \n\nIt\u2019s not the same thing as no condom, but my personal experience is that it is still noticeably better.\n\nEdit: lmfao I replied to who I thought was OP, but it appears as if the person replying to me also thought they were replying to OP in the original thread.

I saw another comment suggest masturbating with a condom on to get used to the feeling and process, and I think that\u2019s a really good idea.\n\nI don\u2019t think you need a pill, probably just some understanding and patience from your girlfriend.

You're already doing the right thing by being honest with your girlfriend. Cialis might help as a short-term aid, but it's best to talk to a doctor first.

I recognize when i don\u2019t masturbate, i have more confidence, love for my fianc\u00e9, and long lasting erections. She has been sexually activate and she wishes she saved her virginity for marriage and so for her wish i can only try to save my virginity for marriage as well.

Performance pressure is a real bitch and not at all conductive to a romantic mood, so kick that out of your bed. Without an erection you can still touch and kiss each other and it can be just as good.",

I\u2018m saying that you can take the pressure off by explicitly not setting the penetration part as \u201dgoal\u201c. If there is no penetration planned, there is no pressure to perform. If the condom is a particular problem, you could even try to use a condom without planning  to have penetrative sex, maybe that could work.\n\nOf course, each person is different. This might help you in your specific case or not. But generally I think it\u2018s good advice for most people in that situation.",

You're pushing some shitty nasty smelling rubber on your junk. \n\nGive yourself a break. IF you really need to, set up a virtual doctor appointment and get Viagra.  Super quick. \n\nThe other possibility is, she just doesn't turn you on enough, OR you're not doing enough fore play to turn yourself on. Sometimes with condoms, you want to open them and hold them in your hand. While you rub on her, etc, you pop it on as quick as possible. Once it's on and you're hard, you should not lose the erection.",

        "post-author": "No-Plum-7970",
        "text": "Hello! First time using reddit, but I'm really anxious about this, and I could really use some help. I (17F) have been babysitting for this couple (\\~30M & \\~30F) since I was 15. They have three kids all under 10 who I absolutely adore, but I don't know if I can even babysit them anymore because of this situation. I feel like I need to give some context before we get into the meat of this story.\n\nThese people are new to our neighborhood, and my mom encouraged me and my sibling to introduce ourselves and offer to babysit for them. My sibling ended up working elsewhere, but I hit it off with them and their kids. The parents (Lets call them Amy and Bob) were also super friendly, and I didn't feel uncomfortable, at first. After about a year of watching their kids, I became somewhat of a full time Nanny the summer I was 16. Amy worked full time, and Bob was injured in the line of duty, so they needed an extra hand. I worked somewhere between 4 days a week for about 5-6 hours each day (and I made bank thankfully). Because of Bob's injury, he was home about 1/3 of the time because of his pain and inability to actually care for the kids (which is where I came in). Because he was home a lot, I had a friendlier relationship with him. With Amy we are friendly but it is more professional. This is about the time things started being weird.\n\nWhen I say Bob was friendly, I mean sometimes it felt like he was tethering the line. At first he was just smiley, cracking jokes with me, and seemed genuinely interested in what was going on with my life. But then he started making some comments. It was never about my body or anything, but if I mentioned I was going out with friends, going on a trip, or had plans, he made these comments like \"Don't get into too much trouble\" and stuff like that. I thought it was a little weird, and I mostly thought he meant 'don't do anything illegal' or 'don't drink' which, yeah, still a little weird but I just thought it was a generation difference. But then the comments turned towards more \"Don't have too much fun,\" and many of his comments started having sexual undertones, implying I was going to meet up with someone to have sex, or I was going to meet someone on my vacations. I'm pretty sure he once actually called me \"a freak\" in the sexual sense. I would always laugh off the comments because yeah, they made me uncomfortable. But I'm still a teenager, and I didn't (and still don't) know how to tell a 30 year old man to stop. This is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nA little before this, probably closer to when I was 15, both Amy & Bob followed me on their respective Instagram's (I know *now* that this is enterally unprofessional and I should have not accepted, but I was 15 and this was my first job ever, so give me some grace )*.* Amy posted mostly about her family, while Bob did as well but he also posted about playing video games, gym stuff, and martial arts. I never really interacted with their Instagram's they were just there. Then Bob started sending me reals. And I was stupid enough to send some back. That was it for a while, just funny videos about memes or the occasional news story. There was a LOT. But once again, some of the videos got weird. Sexual. None of them had sex of course, but there were sexual implications about couples having fun, or sex jokes and things like that. I don't mind a sex joke once in a while, but only if its with my friends within my age group. This once again was weird and made me uncomfortable but I didn't know what to say. THEN (of course there's more) he starts texting me on Instagram. And like all other times, it gets weird. It was usually at night, and he mentioned being drunk a lot of the times. He was asking me personal questions, telling me way to much about his life ( I think its important to state that he was groomed as a teen by an older women but just, doesn't realize it? When he mentioned it he seemed to think fondly of it, so maybe its an indication this behavior). He told me I was very mature for my age and nurturing, which was a BIG red flag for me, so I started making excuses.\n\nI told him I'm trying to get off Instagram so much so I delete it a lot (which is true, I did start doing that partially because of this but also because I doom scroll way to much) and I put a one hour timer a day for it recently. When he added me on snap (I felt compelled to add him back when he talked about it in person), I said I don't really do streaks and I'm barely on it (this became true after I added him as well). I think I saw in the back of my mind all of the red flags, and I was defiantly weary, but I tried to just put a distance. I know it seems like there where a lot of instances where I could have shut this behavior down, but once again, I am a 17 year old girl, and this is a 30 year old man whos been in the military. No matter how friendly he is, this behavior makes me nervous, and I don't actually know what will happen if I say anything. Its also important to note that he offered to train me in martial arts when I expressed interest. It never worked out because of my schedule, and I'm honestly glad.\n\nSo now we get to like, two nights ago. I'm on Instagram and I'm using my one hour. He texts me, and I know he saw that I'm active, so I ask him what's up. Bad choice I know, but I also know I can just use the excuse that my phone locked me out if I want to exit the conversation and he asks. So I say what's up, and he asks me to respond to a poll about muscle mass. I think its a little weird, but he's a gym rat so not totally weird, and it seemed innocent enough. So I agree, and instead of a poll he sends a picture, and I'm tired so my dumbass opens it and low and behold, its a boner picture. Of course I close it, and I sit there in shock after closing Instagram for a few seconds. After a while he sends a message saying something like \"I'm sorry if that was too much.\" I simply responded \"It is\" and I've had my phone on DND since.\n\nIf I'm being honest, I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I want to tell Amy but I don't know. I don't think she knows, as she's super busy with work a lot and is very no nonsense. I don't think Bob is a danger to the kids (he has two girls and one boy), but once again, you never know. What if I ruin Amy's life? What if I ruin her family? What if me telling her gets her or the kids hurt? Don't even get me started on my parents. Do I tell them? I love them and they'd be 100% on my side, but I don't know to what extent they'd go. Would they confront Bob? Would they go to the police? I really don't want to go to the police, but what if another girl is in my position and accepts the advances? I'm just really confused, and I'm willing to take any advice. If your still reading this, thanks for taking the time to look at my situation :)\n\nEdit: I've looked at a lot of your comments and thank you all so much for your advice. I'm still not sure what to do, but I have started taking screenshots of some of his messages. I'm a little nervous looking back, because I really did have some nice conversations, but at the points where I'm uncomfortable I'm scared it seems like I'm egging him on. I'm still going to collect evidence. I still don't know if I should say anything, but everyone's advice is really helping me form out a plan if I choose to pursue action. Again, thank you for helping me!",

I do think Amy needs to be told - if only to protect other sitters. But your parents can help you deal with that. She will not take it well and it would be good to have an intermediary.

He wanted to see how far could he go before you tell your mother and or his wife. The follow up is. With your parents knowledge if I was in your situation. I would 1,000,000,000% let his wife know.

I'm old enough to know better as is Bob. He knew you were not egging him on.\n\n\nHe's taking advantage of the fact you are too young to have experienced this before and he believes he can get away with it. It's very likely he has been inappropriate with other people in the past and we simply don't know how far he has taken it with those people.\n\n\nYou seem very sensible and you are thinking about this in the right way, but please speak to your parents and speak to the police.

If he didn't want those things to happen then he as a grown adult should have protected his family. You don't have any control to protect them. If he would do this to you then he would have done this to another girl. That's the best part about you still being a minor. You don't hold any responsibility to what happens after you speak out about what has been done to you.- (I am a survivor of abuse and this was really hard for me to believe before I was 25. Please trust your parents to know the right thing to do for you. Don't protect a grown man from his consequences. Don't deny your parents the ability to protect you. It will haunt them for years with guilt. They will blame themselves for not seeing the signs.)\n\nCut off all contact that you possibly can after taking screenshot of everything. Keep this post as well to help you remember things. Tell your mom and ask to report it to the police. Don't tell him or his wife anything. You don't owe them anything and the wife might just do what she can to protect her husband. HE IS TESTING YOU! If you don't not act swiftly and protect yourself at all costs and fronts he will take it as an invitation to push it further. My mother was sexually assaulted as a teen when she was babysitting in front of the kid. It does not matter if you believe he will or won't. In these situations you block yourself from the threat and let those who have brains that have gone through as much life as him fend him off. He is calling you mature because he is trying to get closer to you by making you feel \"seen\". Your instincts are correct in this situation and even if they weren't it is not your job to sort that out. Predators want you to believe it is so they won't have an adult who has the experience to see through all of their inappropriate behavior and tricks to step between them and their targets. You are as mature as you are meant to be and taking on a 30 year old man is not an appropriate weight for you to devote your time to. Please tell a trusted adult ASAP! I believe in you. Trust your gut. It's not lying to you about the danger here. You don't have the life experience to understand the details of what your gut is fully saying but you know enough to know this is not OK or safe. You are very wise for asking for help. You're lack of experience in this area is appropriate for your age. Please find an adult you trust to protect that age appropriate wisdom so you don't have to experience the horrors of how others gained their experiences. You have done nothing wrong. Hindsight is 20/20. You were targeted for your age not something being wrong or unwise within you. I will be praying for your safety and I am so sorry he put you in this position. He is counting on your age meaning you will stay silent and fall right into his trap. Prove how wrong he was and dont stay silent. Call your loved ones in to fight a fair fight for you just like he is hoping you won't. He would have done this to any young women your age. It's not something personally with you. \u2665\ufe0fIT IS NOT YOUR FAULT\u2665\ufe0f You are doing a great job being just as mature as you need to be to protect yourself and not have your emotions and vulnerabilities as a minor teenager taken advantage of. I'm so proud of you. Good Luck \ud83e\udef6\ud83d\ude4f ps. If you are finding it hard to tell your parents then share this post with them so they can read it.

There is literally an entire p*rn genre dedicated to this exact scenario you've found yourself in.\u00a0\n\n\nImportantly - you cannot be around this person.

But you need to get your mom involved now before this gets worse - and it will, faster than you can imagine.

I had a \\*somewhat\\* similar experience when I was a bit younger than you but with someone that wasn't all that much older than me, but with similar messages and me just not knowing what to do about it (thankfully it never got as far as this situation). I'm sure the idea of telling your parents seems mortifying, but this is definitely at a level that they need to be clued in no matter how you end up handling it- it's just too much for you to handle on your own, you need reinforcements. Obviously your parents will have their own thoughts about how to handle the situation, but don't let them push you into doing something you're uncomfortable with, no matter what that might look like for you. YOU are the victim here and your thoughts and feelings need to be respected, not trampled. I would definitely take screenshots (not of the picture, but of the other texts) so you do have evidence of what took place, whether you end up needing it or not. Depending on how things go from here, it may be worth looking into what the requirements are to get a restraining order, if he say handles everything badly and keeps trying to contact you (but note that most states have two types of orders, one for family members or romantic relationships, and another for strangers, and you would fall in the second category, sometimes referred to as a no stalking order). Hopefully you won't have to go there, but you should know you have options if things do get worse from here. I'm sorry you had to deal with this, I know that feeling of panic when you're so very uncomfortable with what you're being sent and yet feel like there's nothing at all you can do about it. Make sure you get some therapy as well, hopefully after things die down a bit and aren't so crazy anymore. Sending love.",

OP, you could have LITERALLY asked for this and it wouldn\u2019t be your fault. \n\nFor context, I am 33 and there is no situation where I would even be texting with someone under the age of 18 unless they were a family member or it was logistics (what time can you babysit, are you free to work Saturday, etc.) I do some work with kids and if one of them found me on Instagram and sent me a reel, I wouldn\u2019t respond. As the adult in the situation, it would be my responsibility to set the appropriate boundary. It is normal for kids to sometimes have crushes on adults (not saying you had one just clarifying), but it is never OK for an adult to reciprocate or encourage those feelings in any way. \n\nAlso, and this is not a knock on your maturity or intelligence (you seem awesome), but as someone a similar age to this guy, I 100% see a child when I see/talk to someone who is 17.",

                "body": "This man is a predator, he has been slowly and carefully manipulating you.  The positive interactions were all specifically designed to peel back the normal and natural protections you have and leave you conflicted and confused.  He is more than 30 years old, he knew what he was doing and to whom he was doing it.  I have no doubts whatsoever that this is also not his first time doing this.  You are not alone and you are not the first one he has done this to.  Also, *you* don\u2019t do anything wrong.  You are not the one that would ruin Amy\u2019s life-HE IS.  You are not the one that would ruin her family-HE IS.  You are not the one that would hurt Amy or her kids-HE IS, and very likely you would be protecting her and the kids from this predator!  \n\nYou do need to talk to your parents, and you do need to take this to the police.  He needs to be investigated and his secret needs to come out so Amy can decide what to do and how to protect herself and her kids, and future young women can be protected from him.  Please, I know it is scary and I know it feels unreal and unbelievable, but he is depending on you feeling scared and not being willing to tell anyone.  Nothing that has happened or will happen is your fault!  Nothing!  This grown man made the decision to take a relationship into an inappropriate place and then keep going with it.  He is not going to stop until someone stops him.  People like him need the police to get involved and the courts to label him so that communities can know about him and protect themselves from him because he will never be safe to be around.  As far as him telling you that he was groomed by someone when he was young, that makes it doubly abhorrent, he is consciously making the decision to do this when he was a victim too.  It makes me scared for his son as well as his daughters!  \n\nI am sorry that you are having to deal with this.  Please have a conversation with your parents, if you are worried about how they may react, talk to a teacher or guidance counselor at school so they can help you and help your parents to get through the initial shock and figure out how to proceed.  I know parents can sometimes freak out and your concerns about \u201cwhat extent they\u2019d go\u201d is coming through loud and clear.  Having another adult there to help you navigate this conversation can make a big difference and help your parents to maintain control and not do anything that anyone might later regret.  Confronting Bob is not the appropriate thing to do, and having a trained adult there to help your parents get through their initial feelings may make it a lot easier for you.  \n\nAgain, you are not alone, you did absolutely nothing wrong, you have no blame for what has happened or what may happen in the future, you are brave and strong for standing up and realizing that something is wrong here and preventing this predator from being able to continue to victimize other young people.  You are not responsible for what he has done, you are not responsible for how any other person may react to the truth when they learn it, these are all adults that are responsible for their own actions and their own choices.  I am proud of you, you are a wise and smart and strong young woman.",

Tell your parents. If you have a close relationship with them then please go to them. I strongly encourage filing a police report. You are 17. You did absolutely nothing wrong. You were not flirting, you were just trying to be friendly and nice. Do not think in any way that you have done any wrong. But you do need to stand up and do SOMETHING.

If you are feeling traumatized, please talk to a therapist. \n\nThere are a lot of people telling you to talk to the wife.  I think she should find out, but not from you. You are the victim in this, and a minor. You should talk to your parents and then they should go to the police with the evidence. \n\nIf they are not comfortable with that, they should at least talk to Amy and show her what happened.  I don\u2019t think you should talk to Amy, Bob, or (by extension) the kids again.  This is not your mess or responsibility to handle.   It\u2019s not a problem you need to fix. You are a minor. \n\nIf you\u2019re questioning whether Any should find out, she needs to. If not to protect herself and the kids, to protect a future nanny or babysitter they may employ. \n\nI know it took courage to talk about this and to write it. It will take more courage to tell your parents.  Remember that you did nothing wrong.  Good luck with all of this.",

                "body": "First of all, I'm glad you are asking for advice rather than trying to just keep ignoring it and it's good that you want to do something about it. \nIt absolutely is not okay that he sent you stuff like that and has crossed those kind of boundaries. \nThere are things that a person can do to try to protect and stand up for themselves, but just because you chose to interact with him when you didn't know what else to do does not mean that it's your fault and I just want to really stress that to you because there's so much tendency for people to victim blame or for a person to internalize guilt and shame when really a person just did not know what to do in their situation and unfortunately, so many girls end up being disrespected, and sometimes even very badly hurt because they are trying to be nice. \nBeing firm with your boundaries is not mean. \nIn fact, it's not \"nice\" is somebody advancing towards you the way that he has been. \nI'm proud of you for saying to him that it was too much and I'm glad that you did not continue to interact with him. \nI think that you need to go get proof of it in case he tries to delete his messages because he probably will.\n I understand you wanting to tell Amy, but I think you need to tell your parents first especially since y'all don't even have a strained relationship or anything cause honestly I feel like if she decides to take her husband's side it's going to work out a lot better for you if there is already someone backing you up like your parents. I think you need to show them, explain to them what's been going on and talk to them about your side of it and how it's been making you feel and then y'all can figure out how to handle things.\nHonestly, I hope they choose to press charges because even though you were not just some blabbering little baby, you are still a minor and as a woman in her 30s who had a man online that was trying to groom me and had really inappropriate Internet interactions with me, I'm quite disgusted towards that dude's behavior towards you. I knew deep down that  the man in his mid 30's talking to me when I was 16 wasn't right but I didn't fully understand until I was a bit older just how messed up it really was. He took advantage of me being at an age where I was finding myself, wanting to explore such things and the fact that I had some emotional wounds that did make me susceptible to an older man (which is what I was into when I was that age) giving me attention. He was far too old to not know better and there's no excuse for it. There's also no excuse for Bob behaving the way he has towards you. It is sad that he was groomed by an older woman and it's heartbreaking to me that many men who were ABUSED by older women get treated more like they're lucky to have fulfilled some sort of older woman fantasy when really the fact remains is that that is still sexual abuse and a grown woman should not have been messing with a young guy, more than an older man should be messing with a young girl. \n But regardless of what happened to him, there's no excuse. Just like there's no excuse for someone to abuse someone else just because they were abused at some point in their life. Some things truly do work for person's mind and I'm not saying that there's not some underlying mental and emotional problems there for him. But it's not okay. I know a lot of people have become accepting of large age gaps. and I'm not even touching that subject, but my issue with this is that he is a full grown man (with a wife and children know less!) and you are still under age where no matter how smart and even why you may be, your brain is not fully developed yet. You are still maturing and at this point, he should be far more matured than to behave the way that he has, especially with someone your age.\nAnd I seriously hope you never go back to their home or work for them again, you need to stay away from that guy even if you made bank. You being treated with decency and not at risk for something bad happening to you is far more important than money and you can get another job\ud83d\udc9c",

I don\u2019t know how to cope with this feeling of guilt and grief\u2026 I\u2019m embarrassed and ashamed this happened. It\u2019s been my worst fear so I\u2019ve always been careful. But I got excited about feeding a squirrel and I turned around fast without thinking and I ran over the chipmunk with my wheelchair. I\u2019m ALWAYS cautious and click my chair before moving but I didn\u2019t because I was so excited about feeding the squirrel and I turned fast without thinking of my surroundings. all happened so fast\u2026 The chipmunk was coming up to me for his daily peanuts and\u2026 I killed him. I\u2019m an absolute mess. I can never forgive myself. The chipmunk trusted me, and because of me he is gone. I was just hanging out with him for hours the day before and now he\u2019s dead because of me. I\u2019m in so much pain emotionally and spiritually. I don\u2019t ever want to be born again because life is brutal and I just can\u2019t handle these feelings of loss and guilt. Even though it was an accident, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I killed him. He is dead because of me and my heart is completely shattered. I took away his life, he will not be running around in the grass and enjoying the summer because of me. I cannot stop crying. Even though he was a wild chipmunk, my bond with him was as if he was my pet. I loved him with my whole heart. I feel so guilty and depressed that this happened. I don\u2019t know how I can cope. How do I live with myself\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m in a nightmare. Ive been hesitant to share this because I\u2019m very embarrassed and ashamed this happened but it\u2019s eating me alive and I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026 how do I live with what I\u2019ve done ",

You don't need to blame yourself.\n\n  \nI similarly killed my pet kitten, and I had bad PTSD about it for years. It took me two weeks to be able to sleep in a bed again, as it happened in my bed (I fell asleep holding it, taking care of a few week old kitten is brutal on your sleep schedule) I mostly just laid on the floor for weeks and cried.\n\n  \nI couldn't sleep for weeks, I couldn't look at a cat without wanting to throw up for years, and eventually I got married and when I laid next to my wife and if she touched me in my sleep, I would wake up crying in a panic attack trying to make sure she was still alive. Eventually, even that went away, and now I've even brought my other cat from my parents house to keep her with me again. \n\n  \nSo you'll get over it, and there's nothing you really need to do to get there except wait and be sad.

People are afraid to feel, sometimes even forget to.\n\nTake solace in the fact that it was unintentional and honor the life in some way.  Make amends. Continue to be kind because it requires great strength. I have thought similar things lately because I have much guilt, embarrassment, and shame. These are my immediate habitual emotions when something goes wrong, and it makes small or large events stick like trauma. \n\nMy mother in law mentioned kids the other day and the first thought was I\u2019d rather spare them the trials of life.

        "text": "Last week, my (now ex) boyfriend of 7 years sat down with me and told me he thinks he is gay. We\u2019re 22, we\u2019ve been together since we were 15 years old. \n\nThroughout the last year I\u2019ve felt our relationship was off or going downhill, because he completely stopped wanting to be intimate with me, and our interactions started to mostly feel more like best friends than a romantic relationship. Which at the time, I thought was just a rough patch/side effect that comes with being together for so long, but in retrospect I should have at least questioned lmao. But THIS was the last reason i would have suspected. there really wasn\u2019t any signs until more recently.\n\nHe told me he started having these thoughts and feelings over the last couple months, and when we broke up he assured me that he did have romantic feelings. But at the same time, the last couple months he had still been talking about our future, bringing me to every family function, spending the night at my house, everything seemed completely normal.\n\nThis is so incredibly hard for me. I love this man so deeply, i got so connected to and comfortable with his family, not only were we together so long but on top of that he\u2019s my first love, my first everything, we spent our childhood together, and alot of the time because of my struggles with my family and my own struggles, I felt he was the only person Ive ever met that 100% understood and loved me. As much as I love him and want to be supportive and understanding, I feel a bit betrayed by this? Then I feel wrong for feeling that way. It\u2019s a never ending back and forth in my head.\n\nIt also comes with all the confusion and insecurity. Questioning what was real and what wasn\u2019t, feeling like maybe I wasted so many years of my youth, grieving both a 7 year relationship and my first love/best friend, and just all the insecurity that comes with realizing you spent 7 years with a gay man lmao, even if HE didn\u2019t know it. I know that I didn\u2019t necessarily WASTE those years because I truly love him, felt loved back and was taught so many relationship and general life lessons, but it\u2019s hard to completely not feel that way either. \n\ni catch myself thinking that I wish he would\u2019ve just cheated on me or something cause it would be easier to process or get over. I know i\u2019m very young, and that i\u2019ll meet so many more people and do so many more things, etc. But right now it really does not feel like it, and really does not feel like I will ever have that again. I guess i\u2019m just asking for advice on how to cope with this and move along with my life? I know moving on is my only option here, i just don\u2019t know HOW. Right now I feel very lost.",

I was 24 when we broke up and we went through so much shit when we were younger all for it to amount to nothing. Or so I thought. \n\nBut it helped me realize all the things I took for granted, all the things I realized I needed and deserved in my next relationship. I try not to see it as a waste, I learned many things about myself in general and how I programmed myself to react so now it\u2019s all about unlearning that and dealing with things correctly. \n\nYou\u2019re younger than I was when I had to restart and it was scary, but it\u2019s better you know now, than married 3 years in with kids. I know it doesn\u2019t seem like it now, but it\u2019s for the best. Take this time to figure out who you are, without him. It doesn\u2019t have to be this huge scary stop.

I told my partner I wanted to explore other things and she also (understandably) felt hurt and betrayed and blindsided. Being in it now myself, I honestly don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a world or a way where you wouldn\u2019t feel betrayed. Tbh I feel like I kinda betrayed myself on accident or whatever. \n\nYour bf (like myself) probably really fucking struggled with this especially keeping it from you - I know I felt like absolute fucking shit keeping this \u201csecret\u201d from her. But it\u2019s really scary, especially if you\u2019re not actually sure of your sexuality. It takes a lot of courage to vocalize especially to a long term partner who you love\u2026 but just because it\u2019s courageous doesn\u2019t necessarily make it right or maybe there was a way he couldve gone about it differently depending on your guys\u2019 situation idk. Just know this was more about him than it was about you.\n\nWhen I started having feelings for guys, that didn\u2019t affect my relationship with my gf and I still love her very much, but love itself sometimes isn\u2019t enough. Please don\u2019t fall into the trap of what was a lie and what was wasted because I\u2019m sure he cherished and really felt every moment he spent with you. \n\nYou sound like you\u2019re handling this the best you can. It\u2019s an awful and complicated situation for all around - I\u2019m hoping you can give him some grace (as I\u2019m hoping my gf can do for me) and that you are able to heal as needed.\n\nWishing you both nothing but the best xx",

Except my relationship was that we both were boys same sex, turns out my ex wasn't gay, he was bi and we ended our relationship because he wants to start a family with a woman. We had planned our whole life together, but what can you say right.\n\n I realized that i had reached a point in mine and my ex's life where we were lucky that we made it thus far, when it became apparent that we couldn't take one more step together, we decided to not continue, we broke up and went our separate ways. There was nothing wrong. I grieved that I lost like i have never grieved before. So i understand how it must feel for you, you know feeling betrayed and feeling like being left behind or something.\n\n \n So buckle up because right now you are at the crossroads, things are about to change and i will be completely honest with you here that it will take time, things won't feel the same but there's a beauty in this tragedy that the things don't have to be same.\n\n\n\nStart a new day today. Every experience is a good contribution to our lives no matter what the journey ever goes on.\n\n\nA warning that for a while you will be thinking about him constantly because 7 years is big chunk of life, so many memories, laughters and the feeling of oneness in love. You are going to feel empty and lost, we all have been there. Allow your mind and your self to process the loss, don't bottle it up because it will only hurt later. Deal with it now, grieve and mourn the loss. Let your brain calculate and process the whole situation. Look at it from different perspectives.\n\n\nNow the things above that i have said, they should set you up on the road of recovery.\n\n\nBut it gets better, can you imagine a few more years to be with him? While knowing now that there was no way for this to work out now like it did before. So it's better that it ended now and you are not on going with him here on out because you have your own road that will take you home. \n\n\nThere's no secret to getting over someone really. It's literally the easiest things for some to do to get you back to your loop.\n\n\n\nTake everything that reminds you of him, put it somewhere away from your sight because these will always remind you of him more often and for the sake of your own mental health. Put his stuff away.\n\n\nNow is a good time to make new hobbies because before you were always compromising and always giving priority and dedication to the relationship, now you have all the time and resources to utilize it for yourself to make you a better version of yourself.\n\n\nReconnect with your friends and go attend public events with your friends, if you don't have any then make some new friends.\n\nJoin a book club, dnd games or any social experiment. The point here being that we want you to be occupied so that while socializing in community projects you will have time to make more bonds with people and heal too. \n\n\nOne can also always use this time to do some self reflection, after that just keep. Always keep improving and never stop learning. Things will get better soon but you got it in you to navigate these troubled waters and sail to the oceans of self investment, improvement and learning. Best of luck!",

Maybe that\u2019s okay. Does he have to be that special someone in order for his impact on your life to have meant something?\n\nSometimes people come into our lives, not to be our forever partner, but to teach us what we really want, and even give us hints to our real soulmate. They then become our friends or even just people we view as ones who lit the real path. The things you love about him are most likely hints to who the real divine partner is. However the person you\u2019re meant to be with will not feel like a compromise to you whatsoever. They certainly won\u2019t feel like you physically aren\u2019t enough.\n\nI\u2019m just saying I think there\u2019s a silver lining to this. Firstly it\u2019s good he didn\u2019t cheat on you. That means he obviously cared about you even until the end and didn\u2019t want to traumatize you.\n\nSecondly, you have the opportunity to think about the person you ideally want without any compromises. Be brave and think deeply about who your ideal man would be, and be as non materialistic as possible.\n\nClearly there are certain traits from your past partner/s you love but there wasn\u2019t enough to end up with them. I would make a note of all the traits you want in your ideal man, and focus on becoming the most authentic version of yourself to attract them. Reconnect with your deeper self, even parts of you that might be repressed. You being your truest self will be the key to finding that special person.\n\nI send you my empathy and wish you the best.",

Lots of us join after a divorce or some sort of emotional crisis. I joined after I was cheated on. That was over 15 years ago. I still like to attend meetings occasionally because it\u2019s just reinforcing healthy self talk. My wife is super active in coda, much more than me.  Usually ppl find coda when they are in crises and they stay to help the next person in crises. \nGoing to coda doesn\u2019t imply that there\u2019s anything wrong with op. It\u2019s literally just support",

Men are quick to point out a woman\u2019s emotional distress is dramatic, overwhelming, and ridiculous at times. I\u2019m glad everything worked out for you, but for someone who\u2019s upset about her relationship and the feeling is this raw, don\u2019t stuff therapy and meetings down her throat, it isn\u2019t helpful.

Whether you break up or not is up to you.  Questions o ask yourself:  What is keeping you in this relationship?  Does seeing a couples therapist make sense?  Maybe this will help with communication and perhaps control issues she has.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re open to it, a personal therapist might be useful to ensure you don\u2019t blame yourself for this in addition to ensure your self-worth as a person and as a man are properly safeguarded.",

An issue is even the act of trying to protect yourself can inadvertently hurt a smaller partner, and then you turn into the perpetrator in the eyes of others.

        "text": "I (19f) have a sibling (21) who is autistic. They are high functioning and capable, but I swear they consistently use weaponized incompetence to get other people to do the task instead.\nBackground information, my parents are separated and we both live with our mother.\nI started working when I was 16, they began working at 19. Ever since I have made my own money, I have provided for myself. I saved up $8k to buy my own car when I turned 18, then got a loan for $6k on top of it. neither of my parents helped me finance, co signed, or anything. I did it alone. My sibling, on the other hand, got scared of driving because of one day when my father was teaching us how to drive. My sibling was behind the wheel and in reverse, kept going and we ended up backed closely to a tree so my dad yelled to stop. Ever since, they have blocked out the idea of getting a license or even trying to drive. This was 3 years ago.\nThis brings me to now, I work 32-36 hours a week at a part time job. I have been a CSR for 2 years. My sibling originally started working 15 hours a week 2 years ago, but has since been cut to 5 hours per week. They consistently ask me to look at jobs with them because they want to quit where \nThey are now. I do bring them to work because we have similar schedules on this day. They have made me late for work several times because their time management is shit. I feel like since it is a burden on me and my reputation as an employee to be late due to someone else, I shouldn't have the stress of taking them to a different job, more days in the week. This is where I feel unjustified, although I haven't said anything. \n\nI feel as if I shouldn't be responsible for them getting to work if the job changes. I did not birth them, and I bought my car myself. I would feel differently if my parents supplied the car that I use, but they did not contribute to it or help me in any way to get it. I am also looking for another job, of which will be full time. I work more than my mother does, so I feel like I shouldn't have to worry about the schedule I work because they're not my child. My mom also has a more open schedule because she works less. I feel like if my sibling really wants a different job, they should talk to my mom and ask  her what she is able to bring them to. I don't mind helping my family, but I don't think I should be the main transportation for my sibling, either. ",

I normally go to my dad for advice about my mom and my mom about advice towards my sibling, but my Dad also seems to share the idea that I'm responsible for getting my sibling to and from work. He says it's because my mom needs help, yet I do 70% of the cleaning and chores around the house, on top of working more than both of them do. I just feel stuck",

The utter lack of empathy in these replies is crazy. \n\nThe lack of empathy for people who are on the spectrum is insane, no matter how \u201cadult\u201d they look or act, they are still autistic. \n\nThere is a reason autistic people are different from others, autistic people work so differently on many different levels. You apparently are a high *HIGH* functioning adult with autism. Good for you. You honestly can\u2019t expect everyone else on the spectrum to act and be the same as you and what you\u2019ve accomplished and what *you\u2019re* capable of. That\u2019s you and not OP\u2019s sibling. \n\nI didn\u2019t get offended, but when you basically tell people to suck it up, and that the sibling should do the same, whether you were talking to me, or OP or anyone else, your message was still the same; When you turn into an adult, autism or not, you\u2019re solely responsible for yourself and yourself only. And nobody will give you crutches to hold yourself up for the rest of your life.\n\nYou seem rather bitter that someone else that shares a little bit of the spectrum with you, needs help, and *not* the fact OP\u2019s sibling may need EXTRA help from the mother. Which you just completely ignored. It\u2019s up to the mother to help *her* autistic child. Not her sibling. \n\nOP needs to live her life the way she wants to, and she needs to communicate her true feelings to her mom, it\u2019s going to be hard. But the mother needs to shape up and finally be responsible for her child instead of \u2018throwing her to the wolves\u2019. \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean, her sibling is weighing her down, not when they don\u2019t mean to, they don\u2019t mean to be who they are, and maybe they don\u2019t even know everything about autism and how it affects adults. That\u2019s not their fault for not fully grasping.\n\n*Autistic people isn\u2019t every other grown up.*\n\nSorry you took it upon yourself to write something that didn\u2019t go in your favor!",

Versus you who really does seem bitter. I gave my two cents, from my own point of view, and did OP ever say I said anything out of order? No. \n\nI am autistic, and instead of you who spread negativity, I shed light on people on the spectrum, and support people who aren\u2019t autistic but also let people know, yeah we struggle but we are human as well. \n\nSorry you feel the need to want to spread so much negativity and misguidance when it comes to autism on a post, that isn\u2019t even about *you*, lol!\n\nIt looks like you never got the support or help you needed when you needed it, because you seem very childish. On the spectrum, you should know to be an adult, right? You should know to be not so immature, right? Wrong. Autistic people have issues. You claim you\u2019re an adult on the spectrum, then act like it. \n\nThat\u2019s basically how you\u2019re acting like OP\u2019s sibling should be.\n\nI\u2019m not entertaining this conversation anymore, you\u2019ve proven you\u2019re not capable of handling serious conversations like this.

My mother never told me I was autistic, on the spectrum, my entire life. She only told me when I was 18. \n\nGrowing up I was the black sheep of the family, I was always broke and poor and always moving around, but the other side of my family, the narcissistic and snobby side of my family would always ask, when I would get my license, when I would get a job, do this and do that. \n\nI got so much complex trauma that going through high school, I convinced myself I was normal. I convinced myself I was not Neurodivergent, and got a job. \n\nI worked 100+ hours a week at one point at a full time job for almost a year. Until I got assaulted. Twice and that made me unmask everything I had accomplished back then. It\u2019s been five years since then, and honestly, I wish all the time I was different. \n\nI am sensitive to light, sounds, smells, I have a weird dyslexic problem when it comes to my writing, I am on many meds because of the problems of my past, it makes the present days unpredictable.\n\nI had so much hate and misjudgment as a little kid to a growing young adult, that when it became time, all my progress and mental and emotional growth I went through, all came crashing down. \n\nI had to learn about my disability by my own self, I had to understand it and what else comes along with these things. Learn about \u2018masking\u2019 and \u2018unmasking\u2019, ask what is autism and what is other symptoms of other things. It\u2019s okay to have a deep interest in these things, like I said, it\u2019s amazing that you\u2019re so open. \n\nMy advice is to look it up, what you specifically want to know about autism in adults is, even I to this day have to keep looking things up and learning new things everyday. This is not a simple thing, it\u2019s very complex.",

You can do this at your bank, fidelity, heck, even on robinhood (yes, that app)and stick it in some mutual fund (mutual funds are run by people that went to college and have a degrees in things like finance... so overall they do this all day).  Never touch this money, this is for your retirement!\n\n\n3. Once you have about 10,000 in that high interest savings, get an appointment with a financial advisor.

Coffee shop, park, etc.  Have a friend nearby to support you and to get you an out once they start arguing. \n\nThe opening line is \u201cI cannot afford to continue to curtail my life and my opportunities to manage sibling\u2019s life.  This means I can\u2019t risk loosing my job to get sibling to their job.  So I cannot change my schedule to accommodate sibling. I will leave when I need to for work, and only on a case by case basis will I help sibling with transportation.\u201d\n\nNow, here is where the public place comes into play.  I doubt you will get this all out in one go. You will have to keep your calm and stone wall.  You need to be calm and collected which will make any meltdown look like they are being unreasonable. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve gotten your message out, your friend steps in and gets you out. It might be good to couch surf for a day or two to give your family time to cool off. \n\nHopefully once the emotional outburst calms down, they can be more open to constructive discussions. \n\nUntil you are able to move out and live independently, you need to figure out how to keep the peace. Strive to gain your independence, sadly it is likely that your family will directly oppose you gaining independence because it will require them to continue to manage your sibling. \n\nAt their age, your sibling will likely continue to use weaponized incompetence until they are forced by life to gain competency the hard way. Sadly, that means that as your parents become less and less able bodied, your sibling is going to have worse and worse outcomes. \n\nThe best thing they can do for your sibling is to figure out a program that helps functioning autistic  individuals gain independence before your parents can\u2019t support your sibling anymore.",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m hoping to get some guidance here on a situation that happened at work today. One of my female colleagues (36F) didn\u2019t come in because she was unwell, and out of the entire team including females she's closer with, my manager specifically asked me (33M) to call her, check on how she\u2019s doing, and ask if she needed anything. I am not her boss, manager, or her senior. \n\nI don\u2019t mind supporting a colleague, but I found it a little odd that I was singled out for this task, especially since we\u2019re not particularly close. In fact, I\u2019ve made an effort to keep my interactions with her strictly professional.\n\nFor some context: She lost her husband about 8 months ago, and the past 5 months, she started reaching out to me for both personal and work-related advice. I\u2019ve always kept it professional, but she\u2019d occasionally ask questions that felt a bit personal or political, like whether she should share personal information with another coworker, where she should go for vacations etc. It made me uncomfortable, and I would direct her to our senior for advice since I felt it wasn\u2019t my place.\n\nI ended up calling her on her personal number and made sure to mention that the manager asked me to check in. But now, I\u2019m wondering if I should let my senior (who\u2019s been with the company for years) know what happened, especially since my manager is a new hire (only 3 months in). I don\u2019t want to stir anything up, but I feel like it might be wise to keep my senior in the loop, just in case anything ends up being misinterpreted.\n\nThat said, I also don\u2019t want my manager to feel like I\u2019m undermining him or that I\u2019m complaining about him behind his back.\n\nWhat do you think? Should I keep this to myself, or is it worth informing my senior just to cover myself?\n\nI am confused. ",

It's weird. \n\n\nIf any of my coworkers bothered me while I was blowing chunks I'd be unimpressed.\n\n\nAnd it's one sick day. You call in for a sick day and then everyone needs to leave you tf alone.\n\n\nThat being said OP could have just said 'I'm not close to [worker], I think [other worker] is a better fit'. They missed the boat\n\n\nGoing to a manager once removed for advice about how to approach a new direct report leader isn't petty. It may have consequences but it isn't *petty*. \n\n\nIf that was the thing chosen to do I'd go to the direct report first, not the manager once removed and say that you're worried whether calling someone not in a leadership role on their sick day could be taken badly (because it 100% can) especially if you're not close to the person. Cheerfully, because you're looking out for them.\n\n\nPersonally though, I'd let it go and if a similar request came up I'd say I did it last time, it's [other worker]'s turn.",
