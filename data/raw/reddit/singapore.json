        "text": "Singapore Children's Society (SGS) bought my data and send me unsolicited donation letter. They even admit in their email reply *\"We understand that you must have felt frustrated as you received our donation mailers despite not having signed up for them.\"*  \n  \nI have written to Singapore Children's Society CEO, board of directors and MCCY to stop sending donation letters to people who did not subscribe for it. However, they did not respond to my request and give all sort of excuses. \n\nI can't believe that a charity organisation engage in such unethical practices of purchasing people data and MCCY is doing nothing about it. MCCY emailed me on 4 April 2025 *\"We kindly ask for your understanding that the concerns raised are related to an operational matter specific to the charity in question. We recommend contacting the charity directly for further clarification.\"*\n\nThis brings back memories about the NKF saga. It appears that NKF saga would falls within the scope of operational matters and MCCY would not be involved in investigating it. In fact, NKF saga was only revealed after they sued SPH. MCCY did not do anything at it. \n\nI seriously question the lack of regulation and oversight over charity organisation in Singapore. ",

PDPA requires consent first before they are allowed to 'share' (sell) your data but companies are sneaky and will make it mandatory for consent to be sought in order to provide their (after)service and there's no action to prevent this.\n\nTake for example, company X. If you get any of their products, you most likely would register a warranty with them (like duh, their shit is expensive) upon purchase. And inside the terms and conditions of the warranty, you MUST accept that they may use your data to improve their services directly AND indirectly (3rd party). So now X has your contact and other info and you agreed because if you don't then you get jack shit for warranty. \n\nAnd this isn't unique to X, many many companies do the same shit. How do you be careful when the house (Singapore) is stacked against you in the first place. Unlike a Casino, you can't exactly walk out and don't participate. You have to buy services at some point at which then your data is collected in that same way.",

It's the same for hawkers, for those born in early to mid 90s that grew up on wet market visits with our grandparents for fresh groceries/homecooked meals and the occasional \u53e4\u65e9\u5473 hawker food meals, we still crave that \"once upon a time\" flavor, but alas, we're a small population. \n\nAs a young adult U30, I have stopped dining out mostly and prepare my own meals these days, maybe 3 times a month max that I dine out. The new hawkers these days try to attract new customers with these new gimmicks and \"reinventing\" their food because of social media, and the traditional flavor of certain local dishes that I crave are nowhere to be found. \n\nIf these privately owned wet market and hawker stalls are constantly competing with rising cost of living, high rentals, convenience stalls and large supermarkets chains just to stay afloat, then something has to give way. This often ends up being tradition and culture, which is what the hawker and wet market trade is built on to begin with. The foundation of these trades are starting to crack, and even if they somehow find a second wind, it will no longer be the same before. So maybe instead of trying to \"save\" this part of our culture, we should aim to preserve it before it is too late.",

I know why it\u2019s happening\u2014and honestly, there\u2019s not much we can do to stop it.\n\nHere\u2019s a straight-up breakdown of what\u2019s killing the wet market:\n\t1.\tOnline competition: These days, consumers can order fresh produce online and get it delivered to their doorstep. It\u2019s quick, clean, and convenient\u2014hard to compete with that.\n\t2.\tSuppliers bypassing us: In the past, Malaysian suppliers wouldn\u2019t sell directly to small eateries because of low margins. So small F&B businesses would come to the wet market to buy in bulk. Now, suppliers go straight to these smaller stores\u2014cutting us out entirely.\n\t3.\tRental pressure: Depends on the location. For me, rent is still manageable, but many others are struggling. And that adds up, especially when margins are already thin.\n\t4.\tCost of goods is rising: Prices keep increasing across the board. To stay competitive, we\u2019re forced to absorb the costs or make almost nothing from each sale.\n\t5.\tCross-border shopping: Many locals are heading to neighboring countries weekly to buy groceries. Cheaper prices, better variety\u2014who can blame them?\n\t6.\tBig chains like NTUC FairPrice undercut us: A common complaint is that wet markets are more expensive than supermarkets. And it\u2019s true. Big chains like NTUC can bulk order massive volumes, which allows suppliers to give them better prices than they offer us. We simply can\u2019t match that kind of buying power.\n\nOn top of all this, fewer elderly folks are visiting wet markets due to age and mobility issues. And the younger generation? Many avoid it altogether. They find it wet, smelly, messy\u2014and would rather tap a few buttons to get what they need delivered.\n\nIt\u2019s sad to see something that was once such a core part of the community slowly fading away. Unless something big changes, wet markets may not survive into the next generation.\n\nJust wanted to share what it looks like from the ground. Thanks for reading.",

Then I have picked a whole bunch of things leaving me to stand there and call for sos from my husband. Anxiety inducing. \n\nThe other issues is cheating. I'm terrified to buy things that I have never bought before. \n\nI bought mutton shoulder due to peer pressure and it cost me 50 dollars for so little.. ordered fish and 2 or 3 times it was in the hundreds. Honestly now I'm terrified. I just buy all the off parts like the fish head and bones when its labelled.\n\nI just stick to what I know. What pushed me to go to the wet market is ntuc banana are 5 to 7 dollars if I order on the app. The market is 50 cents. Broccoli is 3.50, market is a dollar. \n\nBlueberries are 2 for 6.95? Sometimes 3 for 8 something. If you go to bugis fu lou shou. It's a dollar, exactly the same pack. I can't. I go to ntuc for things like milk, snacks and things I just can't buy at the market. \n\nHonestly, pork, fish, beef is just a steep learning curve. I once bought pork bones. One small pack for 5 dollars. I added half a pork belly, all together 13 dollars. Still OK right. Then my helper wanted 2 kidneys.. ok la. 35 dollars. Wtfffff. The pricing is ridiculous. Things like crustaceans like shells and prawns best to get it at ntuc where the pricing is transparent and fixed. One more example. I bought squid. 3 squid 45 dollars. Never bought squid again.",

Not the student to hold a sign.\n\nDon't think MOE/LTA intends to standard issue signs to all children and expect them to take it with them every moment, eg when going home after school. Do the higher up understand that not all parents drive and fetch them home. Some children still need to take a bus and **cross the road** to get home.",

The practical and creative design is very portable and could also be used as a fan in the heat.\n\nThe Traffic Police and the Singapore Road Safety Council announced the \"Road safety month\" this Saturday (31st May 2025) with a two-day carnival at Suntec City.\n\nThe Senior Minister of State Sim Ann said that vehicular murder is one the rise in 2024,, stating \"Speeding is an especially common occurrence, increasing risks to all road users.\" Through education and publicity of road safety knowledge; which also includes this initiative, attempts to increase road safety through using this \"simple tool that could make drivers see the children better provided they are looking at the road and not their phone.\"\n\nThe Honourable minister says that this initiative and all other safety implementations, will teach the children to be vigilant and to be gracious about giving way to cars at crossings. This would also help to reinforce the entitlement of drivers of our roads.\n\nA gazette by the Singapore Police Force inform that this initiative is rolled out jointly by the Traffic Police, the Singapore Road Safety Council, Land Transport Authority and the Ministry of Education. 7 Primary schools; Bukit Timah Primary, Cantonment Primary, Chongfu School, Greenridge Primary, Opera Estate Primary, Unity Primary and Xishan Primary will be involved in this trial.\n\nA \"mini road safety experience park\", borrowing the design from the Road Safety Park in East Coast, was also set up at the carnival to make a safe environment for children, learning and practicing road safety is important.  There will be plans in place to build these \"mini safety parks\" around the island for children to learn about road safety.\n\nThe Senior Assistant Commissioner of the Traffic Police Daniel Tan reminds every road user that their actions can harm others: \"Check your blind spots, put on your blinkers early, and give way to others are simple actions but will create a cascading effect for a safe journey home\".",

Thats why consultants carry out CFD to check the windflow of their developments. Hot air rises. The volume of air so huge and is technically limitless. The miniscule heat rejection from aircons will not make a dent to overall air temperature. Localised areas yes. The only area significantly affected will be the air well where all the aircon units are located. In fact as the hot air rises, we are worried that the aircon units will short circuit or have reduced efficiency of the units higher up. Also, using concrete has more of an impact on temperature. The concrete stores a lot of heat in the day and slowly rejects it at night, making houses warm inside. Or even during the day. Even concrete pavements and slabs contribute to low level temperatures causing people to think the air is warm but it only at the low level as the hot air rises from the pavement.",

Are we living on the same planet? Can you imagine being a climate change denier when the weather has been getting crazier and crazier in the past 5 years alone?\n\nThe 1 degree Celsius mentioned in my OP was referring to the increase in max temperatures during certain periods of the year as compared to the previous years. Just take the recent heat wave as an example - 36 degrees celcius over a few days, during our schooling days in the early 2000s, that never ever happened.\n\nBut ok, I don\u2019t mind talking to you about yearly averages. When we are talking about climate change, nobody looks at the yearly average numbers in silos. Yearly average temperature can be pretty constant at a glance because the highs might cancel out the lows, and you won\u2019t see that in the average even if the highs and lows are more extreme (they are). If you want to look at average, you should compare average across 1990-2000, to 2000-2010, to 2010-2020. This will give you a more accurate representation of global warming.\n\nThe following are often looked at together to paint a fuller picture of global warming:\n\n- Daily Min and Max\n- Number of unusual wet/dry spell events\n- Mean temperature\n- Amount of rainfall\n- Wet globe temperature\n\nI mean, **have you tried to sit in today\u2019s classrooms recently** for an extended period of time? Go and have a try if you have a chance to. I went to school in the early 2000s, and I\u2019ve been back in today\u2019s classrooms and I can feel the difference - it\u2019s huge. Of course it\u2019s anecdotal but I have links to prove what I\u2019m saying.\n\nEvery single link I\u2019m about to link below supports every single one of *our* anecdotal experiences of the rising temperatures in Singapore:\n\n1) https://www.weather.gov.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The_Year_in_Numbers_2023.pdf\n\n2) https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/2024-is-singapore-s-warmest-year-on-record\n\n3) https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/wmo-confirms-2024-warmest-year-record-about-155degc-above-pre-industrial-level\n\n4) https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/2023/03/singapore-getting-hotter-temperature-data/index.html?shell# (here\u2019s a good one if you prefer interactive infographics)\n\n5) https://www.nccs.gov.sg/files/docs/default-source/publications/climate-change-how-it-affects-you.pdf\n\n6) https://www.mss-int.sg/docs/default-source/v3_reports/v3_science_report/v3_science_report_chapter_3.pdf\n\n7) https://sites.ecmwf.int/data/c3sci/global-climate-highlights/2024/chart-gallery/supplementary/GCH2024-gallery-figureS1/figureS1.pdf",

But fair enough on how averages do not represent the higher highs, and thank you for those insights.\n\nI have been to a classroom this year and was actually impressed by how it was much cooler than the very intense outside heat, because of good airflow and how the gaps in the top of the walls allowed hot air to escape. But I agree it might not be the case for all schools.\n\n> If you want to look at average, you should compare average across 1990-2000, to 2000-2010, to 2010-2020. \n\nYes, those have been rising because as I mentioned that hotter years are happening more frequently, because of global warming, which I 100% believe in.\n\nWhat I meant was that on a given day it may be 33 deg outside, and back then there were also many days with 33 deg which we tolerated without aircon. Most days still don\u2019t exceed that, which is how the average temperature has not changed much. It would be different if people were only asking that aircon be used for days when it is abnormally hot. Schools should definitely make accommodations for those days to keep students safe. But if it\u2019s a cool period when it\u2019s only 29 deg for example, what\u2019s the justification for aircon on those days?\n\nAircon worsens global warming and the heat and also increases costs, such that they should not be indiscriminately used. I\u2019d love to have aircon every day too, but sustainability messaging currently tells us that aircon is bad for the environment and its use should be minimised where possible. Kids shouldn\u2019t be taught otherwise, since that desire for constant comfort is what got us in this position to begin with. Aircon is justified on days with high heat stress, but not every day.",

We are looking at trends of extreme swings in temperature, which has been more and more prevalent in the recent years. \n\nTaking your example of 33 degrees celcius, there has been more 33 degrees celcius days as compared to the 2000s. In fact, we have sustained heat waves of 35-36 degrees for several days at a go now, which was unheard of in the past. \n\nBack in the 2000s, it was so cold in the morning on most days that you could wear a jacket over formal uniform in the parade square without sweating. Now, you sweat buckets at 7am in the morning in PE attire.\n\n>  I have been to a classroom this year and was actually impressed by how it was much cooler than the very intense outside heat\n\nNo, that wasn\u2019t what I was asking you to compare, please do not shift the goalposts. Of course indoor temperatures would be slightly more bearable than being exposed to the sun. \n\n> Aircon worsens global warming and the heat and also increases costs, such that they should not be indiscriminately used. I try to avoid it except on the hottest days where I cannot cope otherwise.\n\nYes and no. Aircon usage increases the urban heat effect more than it affects global warming directly. It\u2019s industrialisation and pollution that has caused global warming to skyrocket out of control. \n\nAlso, most of the heat in UHE comes from concrete and tar roads absorbing heat from the sun and radiating it back slowly. \n\nI mentioned in another comment about this being a chicken and egg scenario. \n\nWas the rise in temperature in Singapore caused by global warming/UHE, or our innate need to cool ourselves down?\n\n> such that they should not be indiscriminately used. \n\nSo where should we start reducing the use of aircons? Shopping malls? Civil service? Offices? Minister offices? \n\nLet me ask you, if you work in an office, is it air conditioned? If you drive a car, is it air conditioned? We benefit from the incessant use of air conditioning in our daily lives, but suddenly when the idea of allowing our children to enjoy the same perks that allowed us to be productive, all hell breaks loose.",

No snow days, no seasons. Just sweating, day in day out.\n\nI know some people look back at their childhoods with nostalgia but I really really don\u2019t. All I remember is feeling stressed, sweaty, and sticky from the moment I crawled out of bed at the buttcrack of dawn (5.45am). At 7.30am I was just tired, then from 10am onwards the world felt like one big convection oven but I somehow had to summon the energy to finish my TYS. \n\nThe heat and humidity is one reason why I hated PE so I thought I was naturally lazy. Isn\u2019t it crazy that i only discovered the joys of exercise in Uni? I just didn\u2019t like being forced to run around in unbearable heat and hellish afternoon sun, then quickly changing out of my dry-fit shirt to get to chemistry class with sweat still clinging to my back. Feels like many wasted years. Of course, PE is a good initiative, but I don\u2019t think that any MOE administrators actually put themselves into the shoes of the students when they arranged timetables and sports facilities. If they had just ONE higher-up spend a day in the life of a student, perhaps they would discover that not all is well in paradise! \n\nI think Singapore\u2019s education system is definitely better than many of the others out there and I don\u2019t think that I am being \u201cungrateful\u201d to the powers that be. However, I also believe that happy childhoods make people WANT to have children, and one of the reasons why I am just not inclined towards child rearing is that\u2026 I don\u2019t remember being particularly joyful as a child. The heat and the complete lack of empathy and kindness from MOE may have been one of the reasons (my primary school form teacher begged the HOD for an extra fan as she saw how miserable we were but was shut down because of \u201cfairness\u201d\u2026 which shows that some \u201ceducators\u201d won\u2019t even try)\n\nI don\u2019t think I am alone in this\u2026 just look at our TFR. Few people want kids, and those who do have children have to worry about their kids struggling in school because the system just does not care. Nothing changes!",

You're going to have trouble from viruses, heat and other societal issues.\n\nThe main reason can also be attributed to most of the schools being made of concrete which absorbs heat like a claypot. This has been an issue for decades. What is required is for schools to be built using wood and timber which allows the building to cool more naturally and effectively. There's a reason why the Kampong days were cooler!\n\n***Wood is cooler than concrete, especially in summer conditions.\u00a0Wood has lower thermal conductivity and better insulation properties than concrete, meaning it resists heat transfer more effectively.This makes wood surfaces feel cooler to the touch and can help keep a home cooler in warm weather.***\u00a0",

It is always about defending, extending and maximizing his interest at all cost without a shred of ethical considerations and he was never ideologically driven. If you are the USA, if you think rationally and not emotionally, the ONLY nation that could holistically threaten or present itself as the greatest competitor is PRC, especially on the Taiwan issue. While Iran and Russia from a threat perspective, may possess desires to threaten US hegemony, but they simply do not possess equal capability.

The point is not the quota but the number of people being deported due to said quota. What happens if ICE cannot reach the daily quota? Will they pick people applying for citizenship or will they start deporting US citizens? We don't know. But this will not be enjoyable for many US citizens.\n\n4. Yes, the trump and Elon being deported is my opinion, I never stated otherwise. Little reading comprehension can show that it's an opinion. But my opinion was based on the fact that the trump administration is using bullshit claims to kick people into random countries that is not their home. Also, they have very obviously negatively impacted US foreign relations. Many countries placed retaliatory tariffs on the US due to Trump's tariffs and many Tesla shops in Germany are being spray painted. I don't condone vandalism but if that is not negative consequences than I don't know what is.\n\n5. The children being deported situation. ICE prohibited them from speaking to family members and attorneys. This is not legal as they were promised, under US law, legal representation. Even in Singapore, no police or law enforcement can prevent you from talking to you lawyer. The mother also did not request for the child with cancer to come with her. They were also US citizens so no crime has been committed. Can't do the time as you are not doing illegal things, don't go to the US.[PBS source ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/children-who-are-u-s-citizens-deported-along-with-foreign-born-mothers-attorneys-say)\n\n6.

Interesting that they chose to use the word migrants instead of illegal immigrants. Nonetheless, those that were incorrectly deported deserves justice.\n\n2. Why no right? My point is, a Visa is a previledge, not an entitlement. It can be revoked. I understand that Rumesya Ozturk has been released from custody. Thus illustrating that there is a legal path to right a wrong. \n\n3. What is wrong with deporting illegal immigrants? You mean all the migrants was incorrectly deported, even gang members? Singapore practice departing illegal immigrants consistently. Meaning Singapore should embrace illegal immigrants? Get real buddy. We get ourselves in a twist at the rising numbers or foreign talents that are here legally. Again, developing policy and execution of the policy are different topics. My comment was in what Pete Hegseth said, comparing what Trump is doing was what LKY did. You disagree with my statement? \nWhat happens if ICE cannot reach the daily quota? Means Ice has been effective in deporting illegal immigrants and have achieved their goals. \n\n4. How are you financially or emotionally invested into Trump's real estate business and his other ventures or in how well Tesla performs? How well these businesses does, how does that affect Singapore's GDP or our social compact? US foreign relations, you, as an individual, or Singapore as a country, has influence? I have every confidence that US can dig themselves out of the hole that they have dug themselves in. Also, how does these relate to the comment I made?\n\n5. Looks to me like a lot of, they said, she said, with not a shred of evidence produced. I am unable to determine what is the truth or untruth. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdrpoeYWx6U\n\n>Even in Singapore, no police or law enforcement can prevent you from talking to you lawyer\n\nGo read up Internal Security Act (ISA) \n\n6. I am aware of this. American taxpayers are paying El Salvador to house these illegal immigrants. Americans voted for their Presidents, including Trump. Americans knows about Guantanamo Bay and what goes on in that place. American Citizens has not exactly done anything about it, beyond some protest slogans every other year. Similarly, American citizens will not do anything about CECOT. There will not be an armed revolution to unsit Trump. American citizens only vote with their wallet. \n\nBy the way, how is it that the global sovereign countries are so reliant of US, economically and for defense, that their legs go jelly when a 'rogue' President is elected? Like, why does EU require US to backstop any peace deal between Ukraine and Russia? It's only now that EU agrees to spend 3% of GDP on their own defense. Economically, every country wants a trade deal with US to stop or reduce the tariffs. When Trump announce tariffs on 'Liberation Day', every country says it's unfair, will create recession etc etc. Wasn't Plan B thought out in advance? Serves all of us right for not being prepared.",

Visa, even if it's a previledge, is still a part of the legal process and cannot be revoked willy nilly. This is so that the government cannot abuse the visa system. There shouldn't be a wrong in the first place.\n\n3. I never say that deporting illegal immigrants is not good. There were many people deported without due process and many were labelled as gang members due to their tattoo. The administration has never given any proof they are gang members other than the photoshopped picture held by Trump. \nSingapore should not \"embrace illegal immigrants\" as you say. I'm saying we should not be following the US and kick people out of the country without proper legal representation. If this really happens, what stopping the government labelling you as a gang member and throwing you in CECOT? \n\nAnd if ICE cannot meet the quota does not mean they are effective. Their goal is a certain number not reduced illegal immigrants. If they don't reach the number they will find other ways to reach the goal. If their goal was to just reduce illegal immigrants, why are people with green cards getting deported for no reason? Why are people in the process of getting legal citizenship being detained. You seem to want them to be detained.\n\nAlso, if you are complaining about foreigners taking your jobs, that's just saying that you are bad at your job. If you cannot keep up in a meritocracy, find a perfect communist country where everyone can earn the same amount.\n\n4. This was written in response to you saying that it was my opinion. I responded saying it was an opinion based off some fact but still an opinion.\n\nI'm not financially invested in Elon's car company but many people in Singapore are. His company is on the stock market and many people trade his stock. With his presence destroying his company, the stock price is falling and many are losing their money. \n\nTrump's liberation day tariffs affects everyone if you don't know. Many good come from America, from certain foods like walnuts to American cars. His tariffs will make everything more expensive. The stock market crashed on liberation day. \n\nI highly doubt the US can dig themselves out of this pit. It's not even a hole now, more like a Mariana trench.\n\n5. Please provide me with the source that is saying the mother wants the child to come with her. It's not a she said, he said thing when the source references the lawyer of the mother and the child. Most sources I've seen that says the mother wants the child to come with her is mostly told by the Trump administration, which we know by now is an unreliable narrator.\n\n6.No global sovereigns are dependant on the US. They all have been increasing their defense budget even during Biden's administration. And obviously, everyone wants a deal to reduce tariffs. It's common to want better deals than what is put out.\n\nNo country said it will cause recession. JP Morgan said there is a 40% chance of recession and I don't think JP Morgan is a country. \n\n They did not want the US to backstop a deal between Russia and Ukraine. Trump says he can stop the war and \"tried\" to do it. Even Zelenskyy said that just telling Russia to stop is plain stupid and won't work. But Trump seems to think he can do it. And failing to obviously. [Trump's tweet](https://apnews.com/article/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-fb61625d2dee8b1917bb3522e73c2166)\n\nI mostly don't think it's the election of the US president causing everyone to worry. It's what the US have. They have nukes and their threats of invasion of Canada, Mexico and the Panama canal is very worrying. Russia not so much, they are being held back by Ukraine and are bleeding resources. The US also has a large weapons industry and they can stop selling or deactivate existing weapons in Europe's hands. Like the stopping of Intel disconnected the HIMARS in Ukraine.

I am trying to explain why Chinese (particularly the older gen does this)\n\nChinese older gen culture thrived on small talk. This means they'll take any topic and make a comment on it. They don't mean any offense with it, but it hurts feelings nonetheless, this is something they haven't picked up.\n\nTimes change, and education equalized the playing field, somewhat. But they didn't experience this equalization as part of their life, so they continue with the narrow stereotyped views of life, but as asians, you can be pretty sure none of them are looking to start trouble. All asians share a common trait of conflict avoidance. They just don't think beyond their norm before they speak.\n\nWhat we can do is to note this difference in world views, and try to gently chide them while maintaining the original intention of the speaker.\n\n\"Aiyo uncle, nowadays everyone can be smart/rich/whatever else thanks to MoE already, this joke outdated la\"\n\nThis sentence gives them an out - to play it as a joke and to conserve their 'face'.\n\nIf you directly confront them, you pin the intent to offend on them, and that antagonizes them. People will react negatively when antagonized, so we help them by allowing them to retract/play off their opinion as a joke while also telling them it's no longer socially acceptable.\n\nIt will work against the truly harmless, but for those stubborn ones, you'll be able to identify them. Then simply avoid them from them on.\n\nSingapore didn't get to where we are by taking offense at many things. Our racial harmony depended on our tolerance and our graciousness of giving the benefit of doubt to non-malicious acts of microaggression.\n\nWe shouldn't let online extreme examples warp our world view of the average person. Most people, to put simply, are just stupid and don't think before they speak in a non-serious casual setting.\n\nEdit: i recognize that being on the receiving end of such thoughtless comments will take a toll, but lashing out truly does nothing for anyone. Ranting online gets you a support group to validate your feelings, but it may not be a healthy outlet if it's the only outlet.",

He said channel 8 programs were superior and much better that channel 5. I just said that it is your POV and it is fine, not everyone is the same. He became agitated and started arguing that channel 8 had more advertisers. I just shrugged my shoulders, and said true but local dramas are childish and doesn't make one think; it's just slop for the weak minded, He blew up and started ranting, I was laughing so hard inside, and just walked away to smoke. \n\nThe microaggresions, as you call it, are just defense mechanisms to cover for one's perceived inferior characteristics, Yes it is sad, but it comes from poor upbringing.

This email appeared to be a legitimate email from Sterra's domain. The SPF record checked out completely - this wasn't spoofing, their actual domain was being used. \n\n2.  The link appeared to go to the legitimate Sterra website, but they seem to have an open redirect vulnerability. The URL structure was something like`sterra.sg/_t/c/v3/`followed by an encoded destination. \n\n3. The Sterra redirect led to a Google Sites page - another layer of legitimacy since Google domains are inherently trusted by most security systems\n\n4. The Google Sites page presented Product test app that instructed users to:\n\n* Press Windows+R\n* Paste a PowerShell command\n\n5. The PowerShell command shows sterr.app. It likes a base64 encoded payload that download an executable from a remote server",

Words cannot fully express our gratitude toward you and the incredible Vietnam medical team,\" the couple wrote in a letter following the successful intervention.\n\n\"Thank you so much on everything that you had done for us.\"\n\nThe wife, pregnant with a 25-week-old fetus, underwent the\u00a0life-saving cardiac interventionperformed by doctors from Tu Du Hospital and Children's Hospital 1.\n\nThe mother had initially been diagnosed at KK Women's and Children's Hospital in Singapore, where doctors identified a severe congenital heart defect in the fetus, posing a high risk of stillbirth.\n\nBecause the necessary procedure was not available in Singapore, she was referred to Ho Chi Minh City for treatment.\u00a0\n\nThis marked the ninth successful fetal cardiac intervention by the two Vietnamese hospitals, and the first time the procedure had been performed on a foreign patient. Doctors said it was also the most technically complex case to date.\n\nIn their letter, the couple expressed deep appreciation for the dedication, tireless effort, and compassionate support of the Vietnamese medical team throughout their stay in Vietnam. Despite the fetus's critical condition, doctors remained committed to saving the baby.\n\nThe fetus, weighing just 600 grams at 25 weeks, underwent two separate procedures. The first, conducted on May 22, lasted more than two hours but was unsuccessful. Doctors were unable to access the left heart chamber because the fetus was in a fixed prone position.\n\nFollowing close oversight from Ho Chi Minh City Health Department Director Tang Chi Thuong and leadership at both hospitals, a multidisciplinary team held an emergency consultation. As the fetus's condition worsened, the experts agreed to attempt a second intervention.\n\nOn May 28, the surgical team succeeded.\u00a0\n\nDr. Do Nguyen Tin, head of the interventional cardiology unit at Children's Hospital 1, recalled the emotional moment when the procedure succeeded. \"There were tears from everyone\u2014our team and the family,\" he said. \"It was a moment of relief and hope.\"\n\nDr. Tin also noted that treating a foreign patient added to the pressure of an already demanding procedure. Expectations were high, especially after the initial attempt had failed, but the team remained focused and determined.\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Department of Health praised the achievement as a milestone in the city's medical advancement. Officials credited the outcome to strategic investment and strong collaboration among specialists in obstetrics, pediatric cardiology, neonatal anesthesia, and diagnostic imaging.\u00a0\n\nThe procedure brought together the best of both hospitals' expertise and marked another step forward in Vietnam's capabilities in fetal medicine.\n\nThe department also commended the entire team\u2014including doctors, technicians, and nurses\u2014for their dedication to mastering advanced fetal intervention techniques and their efforts to save lives even before birth.",

For that, doctors need real, hands-on experience, and they need it consistently. Vietnam has a population of 100 million right now, and these two hospitals where the Singaporean couple chose to have the procedure have only handled 8 similar cases ever. Even in North Vietnam, and especially in Hanoi, they're not equipped to perform this kind of procedure yet, let alone any other hospitals in the South. These two are basically the best obstetrics hospitals in all of South Vietnam, so realistically, if the couple had gone anywhere else in South Vietnam, they probably would have been turned away.\n\n**\"Determined to attempt a second fetal cardiac intervention to save the baby\u2019s life inside the womb**\n\nAccording to Dr. Tr\u1ea7n Ng\u1ecdc H\u1ea3i, Director of T\u1eeb D\u0169 Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, this was the ninth fetal cardiac procedure performed on the Singaporean patient, and it was by far the most complex. It involved the youngest gestational age they had ever operated on, and it took longer than any of the previous eight cases.\"\n\n[https://tuoitre.vn/ca-thong-tim-bao-thai-cho-san-phu-singapore-chuyen-gio-moi-ke-20250530163943683.htm](https://tuoitre.vn/ca-thong-tim-bao-thai-cho-san-phu-singapore-chuyen-gio-moi-ke-20250530163943683.htm)\n\nAnd about what you said, that Vietnamese doctors don't have long-term concerns for patients, maybe you're not wrong. But honestly, even the immediate, short-term risks are massive. The doctors themselves said this was the hardest case they had ever dealt with. Their own colleagues even advised them to reject the case. Risk is risk, long-term or short-term, and it weighs on the doctors too. If you look at the news reports, what made this case so tough wasn't just the gestational age. It was also the fetal position. The fetus was in a prone position. They had to do two separate interventions. In the first one, they spent hours just trying to reposition the fetus and couldn't. At that point, even they weren't sure whether they should continue or not.\n\nHonestly, the only reason they were able to pull this off was because of their actual, hard-earned experience. Without that, knowledge alone wouldn't have been enough.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxQP6qJOnU0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxQP6qJOnU0)\n\nHere's the link to the video of the interview with the Vietnamese doctors who performed the procedure.

Honestly it sounds like the legal system should make it easy for doctor to do the best for patients \n\nkudos to the mother! I hope the baby will be born healthy",

I know a lot of pedestrians also walk on the bike lanes when they\u2019re not supposed to. But that\u2019s exactly the problem: nobody respects the lanes. It\u2019s like we\u2019re all just guessing where to go, and somehow both sides feel entitled to be annoyed at each other.\n\nOf course, some of the infrastructure doesn\u2019t help. There are \u201cbike lanes\u201d that just end randomly at junctions or swerve awkwardly around trees, forcing everyone to improvise. It\u2019s no wonder we\u2019re all confused.\n\nWe call ourselves a smart city. We push \u201cMove Lite\u201d and walkability campaigns. But how is it that so many other cities outside of the likes of Copenhagen, Amsterdam, even parts of Taipei, Beijing\u2014 have figured out how to separate bikes and people properly\u2026 and we haven\u2019t?\n\nIs it infrastructure? Enforcement? Culture? All of the above?\n\nI\u2019d really love to hear if others have thoughts or experiences around this.

Zebra crossing?\n\nBtw, **LTA themselves** say to transition to path, you just cycle from the road, then even though it's a red light, you can dismount on the fucking road itself then you auto become pedestrian to cross the green man or zebra crossing. Then go on pedestrian/cycling path. **THIS IS LTA OFFICIAL RULES HOR.** The PAB test got cover.\n\nEdit: Page 82, go read.

How much more fast food do you eat when there's a McDonald's next to your house or workplace? The placement of a doorway, lift lobby, staircase, street lamp, traffic crossing, bus stop, affects real people's decisions and experiences.\n\nLong ago our urban planners decided that they needed to support people walking since they couldn't let everyone have cars. I think that's why almost every road has dedicated pavements, and sheltered walkways are amongst the most common upgrading projects. This makes walking a genuinely viable option, even if just to the nearest bus stop. I am grateful for that - a true car-centric bald-eagled country will make you hate walking even in air-con weather.\n\nCycling paths don't seem to get the same level of treatment. It's clear many older neighbourhoods have not been planned for cycling. However, there seems to be an unwillingness to sacrifice vehicle lanes for proper cycling lanes. Instead the space comes from the grass patches, or behind the bus stop, or by merging pedestrians and cyclists, but it never comes from the asphalt. Baffling to me is how this seems to also be the case in newer developments which have massive 6+ lane car-lite roads. Let's put up some barriers for \"safety\" too, it's important that drivers need to feel safe to go 50kmh and save 20 seconds, uncle can slowly take the long way round no problem. Some cycling infrastructure is better than none, but a lot of them give off the feeling like they're designed as an afterthought. (I could rant about cars vs MRT too but I'll save it for another time)\n\nBig money is being spent on infrastructure that takes years to complete, and the results will stay for decades more. Why are we implementing B3 hit-the-KPI solutions when the A1 model answer for the 21st century already exists?",

Most road cyclists I see disregard the rules of the road that are designed to protect them (right of way etc). \n\nThere is an absolutely valid reason to drive in the left lane as a car even on a 4 lane road. For example, left turn ahead or heavy traffic only on the other lanes, very common right-turn lane. Or you\u2019re driving a bus or a truck. Constantly changing entire lanes on a car (eg those road racers) increases your danger of getting into a crash due to errors, as opposed to overtaking giving half of a wide lane to the cyclist and then moving back immediately to prepare for a turn. \n\n\n This is more of a problem on a smaller 1 or 2 lane road, where bicycles are prized loudly for taking up less space but at the same time ironically bicycles still claim the full space of the lane to themselves, especially when more capable vehicles need to pass a slow/swerving rider (who may not realize they are as such). \n\n\n> about 10cm distance between us and I was on a MOTORCYCLE\n\n\nThis kind of distances are quite common when one lane splits on a motorbike that is quite capable of keeping up, and stable at that. But 10cm is pushing it, you may consider sending camera footage to SG Road Vigilante. \n\n\n> I wish to one day commute by bicycle cus it's more economical and I get to maintain a healthy lifestyle.\n\n\nSorry to say, it\u2019s more economical because of the taxes you pay to the government on cars and motorbikes (including fuel). Otherwise without COE and taxes it\u2019d be negligible assuming you aren\u2019t living paycheck to paycheck. \n\n\nI personally do not see the appeal of cycling between concrete towers as opposed to parks and PCNs, and yes I did occasionally cycle for leisure at East Coast Park, etc. With the quality time you save on your car/moto, you can go to an air-conditioned gym and do full-body workouts, or go to a swimming pool, or even drive to East Coast Park and take out your bicycle. \n\n\nI posted a thread recently on here about the 25c air-con guideline and lots of people complained about it, yet cycling is going to be WAY hotter and sweatier in outdoors here, and that\u2019s simply not acceptable or desirable at the workplace, school, as a colleague in the same room, etc. And at my previous company the workplace showers were pretty much full and had a queue every morning, even though they had several of them. \n\n\nQuality time > concrete tower leisure.

This is because bike lanes now are just expanded painted sidewalks. \n\nWhat we should really do is put a barrier with designated openings for the bikes to exit the bike lane, and for people to cross. \n\nThere should also be multiple signage indicating pedestrians walkways and bike lanes. The government should also start issuing warnings or fines to people being on the wrong lanes.\n\nThe government can also consider design cycling highways by building a bridge on top of major roads or expressways, so that we can cater to cyclists without disrupting drivers\n\nTo make it safer for all, the government should also require a license before anyone can cycle on the road. Cyclists should only be allowed to cycle on roads if they can hit a minimum speed and have the balance to not swerve left and right everywhere",

However, it's also true that you did copy someone's concept. You probably won't face legal action because small brands don't stand to gain anything in lengthy legal battles, but you will be seen negatively by the public if caught.\n\nI think your analogy only covers part of the potential issue here. The main reason this stinks for me and many others (happy to show proof it's not just me) is that Uniqlo is a global and foreign brand. This is supposed to be their tribute to Singapore and our local culture, but they are now five for five on being \"inspired\" by Musako's designs, with a sixth potential instance here in Pointyrice as well. Ironically, in their tribute to Singapore they are taking away from local creators, and to me this is both equal parts ironic and disgusting. With their full marketing teams and big budgets, surely they could have come up with new and unique concepts.\n\nSo again, no, there is no monopoly on anything cai png related. No one has claim over that.   However looking at all the facts that 1) Uniqlo released designs extremely similar to those of another local creator, and 2) Pointyrice creator pitched this very concept to Uniqlo which they rejected and then went ahead with an extremely similar concept later, then yeah it certainly looks likely to me that there's a pattern.\n\nLike I've said multiple times in this thread, I cannot say with 100% certainty that there is wrongdoing. But I would rather err on the side of a local creator starting her passion project over a Japanese corporation to which this project is but a blip on their bottom line.\n\n[Just because it isn't actionable in court doesn't mean it isn't art theft. ](https://otakuartist.wordpress.com/2010/02/25/american-artist-copy-bleach-and-other-famous-manga/)",

It was a long and challenging journey, but I'm glad I didn't give up. Now I own my place and am financially secure.\n\nI think the best thing about freelancing for me is the freedom, since I can set my own schedule and even travel while working at the same time. Of course, there are minus points as well, such as not having employer contributions to CPF and times when projects are hard to come by, but I'm really glad I made the decision to take the plunge back then.\n\nCongrats and I wish you all the best!",

Water + electricity leh? $100? Internet and Wifi leh, $30-40. \n\nAlso, a counter point for OP, you might be chillax now, but most of the corporate 9-5 eventually once they reach retirement age of say 60yo, they should **minimally** have close to 1 mil. of assets and >$100k or so in CPF. Realistically not ALOT at all, but if you sparingly use and hopefully don't get some terminal illness, then you still can live relatively 'comfortably' till you die.\n\nIf you earn $2,000, when you reach retirement age, how much saving you will have? Enough to retire meh? Then you really is chillax when young and suffer when old leh. Maybe can, if your parents leave for you some inheritance and a house lah... but then ultimately you still relying on your parents mah. \n\nAlso, not everyone will happy with bare minimum lifestyle, really is eat caipng until you die.

He was posted at an above ground station that was quite well-known to be haunted. \n\n\nOne night after the station had been locked up for the night, he went up to platform area with the benches to rest. He lied down on the bench, and covered his face with newspaper. This was in the early 90s, when there was only 1 or 2 staff at every station every night.\n\nHe woke up to the sound of a female, almost childlike giggling, but he pretended to sleep and kept his face covered under the newspapers. The giggling continued on for a few minutes, but he was finally jolted up when he felt someone tickling his toes (he had removed his shoes before lying down).\n\nAs soon as he sat up and removed the newspapers, revealing his face, he heard a female voice from behind him say,\n\n\"*Eh, jejaka lah!\"*\n\n\nWhich translated to English meant, \"*Oh, it's a guy!*\". \n\nNow, in Malay the word 'jejaka' is seldom used now and is considered to be old Malay vocab, and was popular in the early 70s to 80s. \n\nCould it be that whatever woke him up was from a past era? Who knows? Nobody knows. Certainly not my bro in law who shot up and straight up ran out of the station to the nearest mosque to pray.\n\nBonus points to those who can guess the name of the station.

Dunno if it\u2019s real or not but he indeed have a ex-lta friend and claimed he got it from him. \n\nIf u all remembered, woodleigh station was the last to open due to low footfall. Eventually it was to be opened but some preparatory works and checks need to be carried out first.  \n\nSo during engineering hours which is about after 2am, this engineer together with his buddy signed in to enter the tracks (safety procedure).  During these hours, no train is allowed to run.   \n\nAs both of them walked on the tracks towards potong pasir, they checked on the tracks and wiring etc. at mid way, they stopped.  Frozen.  \n\nRight in front of them was a pair of red shoes\u2026. A pair sized for a little girl.  \n\nThey looked at each other and knew something not right.  Both instinctly pretended they didn\u2019t see it and continued checks and walked to potong pasir station.  \n\nNow this is a problem.   They realised they now had to walk back to woodleigh since they had signed in there and now had to return to sign out. \n\nThey discussed what they should do if they saw the shoes then they decided supernatural or not, they would retrieve the shoes.  \n\nSo they made their way back.  Each step they took, they heart beat faster.  Then they reach the midpoint.  No shoes.  Searched around found nothing.   Quickly picked up pace to woodleigh.  Then went to station master to sign out.   They asked if anyone else went down the tracks.  Perhaps that someone had picked up the shoes.   \n\nStation master said they were the only ones for the night.   The signin book indeed only indicated both of them.",

But I ask you ah, you all say you wake up around this timing, but when you wake up and bring your head up, have you ever seen anyone else also awake?\"\n\nMy friend said he went pale when his sergeant said that. Everytime he would wake up in the middle of the night, and check his phone to see it was 3 am, everyone else would be fast asleep. And all the other recruits said they saw the same. No one saw each other awake at night.\n\nMost were glad they were going to be out of there for good the next day.",

                "body": "I've shared a few stories before in another thread, but this time I'd like to share my aunt's!\n\nMy aunt stays in a 3 storied bungalow with another aunt, a helper, and her big Labrador dog. She works in STEM but is still very big on following religious practices and traditions. She is a practicing Buddhist, so in her dining room she has a large altar for her late parents, and an ancestral tablet. This altar looks out to the living room and main door of the house. Every day she will offer incense, and she never misses out on any of the prayer days mandated by her religion. Due to that she believes that her altar is very 'powerful' In terms of energy.\n\n My aunt will walk her big lab multiple times every day, with the last walk late at night. One night, right as they were about to set off on their last walk, my aunt's dog suddenly stopped at the opened main gate and yelped. The yelp was something my aunt never heard of before: it sounded like a mixture of pure pain and fear. She immediately got down to check on the dog, but couldn't find anything. There wasn't a thorn stuck, there were no bite/puncture wounds, and his limbs were completely mobile with no signs of a sprain/spasm etc. Now this dog was a big, gentle goof made out of 40kg of pure muscle. My aunt determined that there was nothing wrong and tried to make him get up. If he refused to go on a walk the least he could do was do his business outside of the gate by the grass patch. But no, the dog was whimpering and absolutely freaked out, refusing to move. \n\nMy aunt was exasperated and gave up, so she unleashed her dog and pew he shot off back into the house and hid under the altar in the dining room. My aunt saw where he went and it suddenly clicked in her head. She looked at the time, saw that it was 1am, and realized it was the first night of the hungry ghost festival. So she turned around to face the main gate and said firmly 'nobody is allowed into my compound'. She then shut the main gate and locked up the house. Needless to say she was spooked and had to spend a lot of time coaxing her dog out from under the altar. \n\n---\n\nRecently my aunt installed a cctv system in her home because otters had invaded her estate. A few had entered her garden once and attacked the fish in her koi pond. So she had some mesh installed, and placed a motion sensor camera in the garden. She also had a few cameras installed around the first floor of her house: one overlooking the living room, one in the dining room, and one in the kitchen. If there was a disturbance she would receive a notification on her phone. \n\nOne late night my aunt and her dog were relaxing in the guestroom that was just beside the altar. Suddenly her phone lit up stating that there was movement detected in the kitchen. No biggie, that could have been the helper coming out of her own room for a drink. So my aunt listened for movement, but there was none. Suddenly her phone lit up again, this time signalling movement in the dining room. From where she was she could look out the door to the dining and living room, but she saw nobody there. The phone lit up again, this time stating movement in the living room. For over an hour my aunt said her phone kept lighting up with notifications that there was movement alternating between the dining and living rooms, yet she couldn't see nor hear anything. At first she thought that maybe otters got in, but it wouldn't make sense since none of the cameras outside of the house were activated. She was beyond spooked, and decided to just sleep in the guest room for the rest of the night.\n\nIn the morning my aunt busied herself as it was one of the prayer days again. When she finally found some free time (and courage), she decided to review the footage of the cctv system from last night. To her amazement, the camera captured two orbs, one bigger than the other, dancing around the dining and living room. They were perfectly spherical, and weren't flitting around randomly like bugs would, but rather dancing around two areas in particular: One was the altar in the dining room, and the other was a corner of the living room, where my aunt had her late mother's walker parked. \n\nMy aunt was overcome with emotion as she realized that that could have been her late mother returning to visit. That would explain one of the orbs, but she wasn't sure who the other orb could be. My aunt teared up, hoping that the other could be her late father or another relative that tagged along for the visit.\n\n---\n\nMy aunt hasn't had any other unexplainable encounters, but she believes that she was 'blessed' with them due to how devoted she has been in her worship, which indirectly gives energy to spirits. It kinda reminds me of one of the plotlines in the movie Coco about how important it is to remember our ancestors thru worship etc. \n\nI hope you enjoyed my aunt's stories! I'll share more when I can.",

Like most people in my generation, I don't really care or believe in most of the stuff.\n\nMy grandmother passed away several years ago. The belief is that her spirit is supposed to return home for a final visit to relatives on the Xth day (can't remember which day it's supposed to be now).\n\nOn that day, I returned home to find a big dried leaf (something from one of the big trees you would see along the streets) in the middle of the living room. Nobody else had been home that afternoon, and all the windows and doors were closed. Our unit is also way above the treeline so it's very unlikely that it could have blown in. My mother said my grandmother probably dropped by that day and left something behind to let us know as none of us were at home. Until today, I still don't know how that leaf ended up there.",

You are to just close the door, go to sleep, and not react to anything you might hear outside your room and stay in until morning. \n\nMy grandmother passed in 2021. I used to live with her and I was very close to her. After X days of the passing apparently they will come back. My mum had already experienced her late mother in law \"coming back\" many years ago, so despite being very Christian she said we should abide by this custom. \n\nThere were 3 of us in the house that night. So 3 of us, me, my mum and my auntie would sleep in the master bedroom which has the bathroom in case, so no one will need to leave their room in the night, and we shared the bed. It was not very comfortable but I was so tired I fell right asleep soon after midnight. I didn't really believe in the custom, but just respected what my mother wanted. \n\nI was woken up by a knock on the bedroom door that night. It was a very clear, unmistakable knock. It fully woke me up from my sleep, but I kept my eyes closed. Then I felt the bed move, as if someone got close to the bed and put a hand on one corner of the mattress trying to get close to see us without falling on us. At this point, I was seriously fully like \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e in my head but I didn't open my eyes. I kept them closed and it was so hard to go back to sleep but eventually I did because I was so tired.\n\nThe morning after, my mum and my auntie woke me up and the first thing they said was \"did you feel the mattress move last night?\". All of us felt it. We recounted it to the rest of the family and one of my uncles said he would have opened his eyes immediately to see his mother \ud83e\udd72 I admit I was feeling kind of scared, I knew I was supposed to just stay asleep but I always wonder what if I opened my eyes? Would I see her?",

For the Non-ns readers, thats the block where medical officers cadets stay.   We did have a MOCC ongoing but the cadets were booked out for the night.  \n\nAs we walked past the block, buddy and I noticed the lights at the ground landing was flickering.  Well it wasn\u2019t flickering earlier   One of the lights in a bunk was also left on.   Being naive 18 yrs old, we were told to check for suspicious activities and so we went to investigate.  \n\nWhen we reached the landing\u2026. Sheesh the lights stopped flickering.  We made our way up and found the bunk doors were opened with an opened lock.   The light switched on was all the way back in the bunk.  \n\nBoth of us walked in to see if there is anyone.  Only bags and personal items.   No one.   Starting to get freaked out, we quickly switched off the light and locked the bunk doors. Then we made our way down.  \n\nAs we exited the building, strangely the lights stopped flickering.   My buddy kept quiet throughout.   We returned to the guardhouse and reported to duty sergeant on the bunk light.  Then we asked if anyone was stay-in.   He looked shocked and said not that he knew and no one booked in tonight.  \n\nI then joked hey maybe the joker cadet is in toliet and laughed it off.  My buddy then pulled me aside then whispered.  \u201cBro I also thought so\u2026. So as we made our way down, I checked the toilet lights.   All were switched off.\u201d",

They couldn't see what was going on at the other side as it's blocked by the wall in the middle. In the morning, when they asked what was going on, nobody on the right side of the bunk heard anything. \n\nDuring our OC engagement midway through BMT, OC asked if anyone had any complains or things to feedback. That section recounted their story. CSM asked which bunk it was, then turned to OC and said \"oh, same bunk.\"\n\nAlso, there used to a very friendly dog there that would follow the duty recruits around when they were prowling at night.

                "body": "During Covid my friend and I did a flat viewing on Purvis Street. The flat was the back part shophouse that has been partitioned. The front part was occupied by a restaurant. The entrance to the flat was on a back alley, where people would park their motors, buses, and cars.\n\nI arrived there earlier than my friend at around 8 pm. Right from the moment that I stepped into the alley I had this eerie feeling all over me. The alley was gloomy and dirty for SG standard and stood in stark contrast to the lively Purvis Street just parallel to it.\n\nThe agent and I then went up to the apartment itself. It was a studio located on the fourth floor that was renting at a price way below the red-hot market rate at the time (one of the reasons why I was interested in the unit).\n\nWe entered the studio and switched on the lights. You know how when you switch on the lights sometime they flicker for 2 seconds before they actually turn on? During these seconds I thought I saw a silhouette of a woman near the window pane. But when the lights stabilized, there was nothing... I thought I was imagining stuff, so I didn't say anything.\n\nIn any case, I felt unwelcome in the flat. The studio reeked of a stench typical of a damp, old room, and there was this overpowering sense of gloom inside. I had to take off my mask (remember, Covid!) and put it on a corner desk as the room was stuffy and I felt short on breath. As is usual for a viewing, I then took a couple of pictures for later comparison.\n\nThe agent told me that the previous tenant was a single European dude who had to break his lease prematurely because of some illness and went back to his country of origin. Now this bit wouldn't have been interesting if not for the fact that throughout the flat there were tons of super long black hairs that wouldn't be typical of a dude. The hairs were especially plenty near and\u00a0*across*\u00a0the window (yes, there were strands of hairs striding the window frame!). This window overlooked the aforementioned dark alley and was slightly ajar.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, my friend finally arrived. Without looking much at the apartment, he signalled that we should leave. When I wanted to re-wear my mask, guess what I found. THERE WERE SOME F\\*CKING LONG HAIRS ON MY MASK. There is no logical explanation as to how these hairs could've been there, as there was no wind and neither the agent nor myself had such a long hair. Luckily, I had an extra mask with me so I simply threw the old, hairy mask away. I then thanked the agent and noped the fuck out of the flat and that area.\n\nAfter we were away from that area, my friend, who has a third eye, told me that as he was approaching the unit from the alley, he saw A FREAKING LADY crawling out of the unit's window and. At an inhuman speed, she (or 'it'?) scaled down the wall and disappeared at a bent. He then told us that we should spend some time in the bright Bugis Junction to dissipate away any negative energy that might have followed us.\n\nLater that night when I reviewed the pictures, all of them turned out to be unexplainably blurry. The one picture I had of the window had these weird dark blots all over it. These pictures gave me creeps so I deleted them right away.",

                "body": "Back when I was a chao recruit in Tekong, I was in Whiskey coy. Taurus coy was the company right next to Whiskey so we always heard them marching past singing marching songs with \u201cTaurus company\u201d in it.\n\nOne night around 3am, I heard a platoon marching past behind our bunk, singing marching songs loudly with some lyrics changed to \u201cTaurus Company\u201d.\n\nI didn\u2019t pay it much heed since they came to BMT earlier than us and might be doing some night exercises.\n\nThe next morning, one of my section mates asked our section if anyone heard Taurus Company marching at 3am. All of us heard it and chalked it up to them having night exercises.\n\nLater the same day, we noticed that Taurus Coy was very quiet and asked our sgt if Taurus Coy was out having night exercises.\n\nOur sgt looked at us surprised and said: \u201cWhat you mean night exercises? They POP\u2019d last week liao\u2026\u201d\n\n  \nEdit: I got 1 more story to share.\n\nMy vocation after BMT is being a Security Trooper, posted to Paya Lebar Airbase.\n\nThere were 8 of us troopers, 4 assigned to Airforce Training Command (AFTC) and another 4 assigned to the Paya Lebar Guardhouse along Old Tampines Road.\n\nWhen we were first assigned, HQ hasn't decided who was supposed to go where yet, so we took turns doing duty at each place for a week, and so we were given a \"tour\" of each place and what we were supposed to do at each place.\n\nWhen we were looking through the bunk at the Guardhouse along Old Tampines Road, we noticed something peculiar in the toilet of the bunk; there was no mirror on the wall. At where there was supposed to be a mirror, there was a faded rectangular shaped outline on the wall, as if a mirror has been forcibly removed from the wall.\n\nWhen we asked about it, the lao jiaos at the Guard house nonchalantly said that there is a little girl spirit haunting the bunk.\n\nThe story went like this: \n\nInitially there was a mirror in the toilet, until a trooper saw a little girl in the mirror, but nothing behind him.\n\nHe quickly reported it to his sgt and his sgt also saw the same thing when he came to check. So he reported it to the OC, and the OC also saw the little girl. So this went up the command chain until the CO himself came down to check.\n\nThe CO looked into the mirror and after seeing the little girl in the mirror, he immediately requested for a cleansing ritual to be done.\n\nBut no matter how many rituals the priests do and no matter which religion the priests came from, the girl still continued appearing in the mirror.  \n\nIn the end, the CO gave the order to remove the mirror and banned any mirrors in the toilet after that.\n\nLuckily for me, my week stay there didn't have any weird occurrence and I was posted to AFTC. \n\nHowever, from what I heard, the other 4 troopers assigned to the Guard house along Old Tampines Road experienced stuff like having their feets pulled, to hearing a little girl giggling in the bunk in the middle of the night. Apparently they got used to it and tried to ignore it as best as they could since besides being a mild annoyance, the spirit did not harm them at all.\n\nThere were also some weird things happening in AFTC, which was considered to be relatively clean for a military camp.\n\nThings like having fire alarm go off in the middle of the night almost every day for no reason during the 7th lunar month, but when we called the service guys down to check for faults in the alarm, everything was in perfect condition. So our sgt had to manually turn off the alarm every time it went off at night.\n\nVehicles in the MT line have their engines start for no reason at all in the middle of the night. We had to call the MT line guys to get the keys to the vehicles in order to turn off the engines.\n\nMultiple stories from the DOs and DSs who had served for several years saying that they had encounters at night and preferred staying in the room assigned for them in our bunk instead of staying in their office.",

                "body": "There have been so many repetitve questions/threads but i NEVER tire of the paranormal ones asking for more stories. Here is my contribution:\n\nMy sister's colleagues are teachers in a primary school. Wont name the school. Last year, these 2 teachers accompanied their students on a school trip to Chiangmai (or Chiangrai). The accomodations are in an apartment style of rooms.  So the teachers stayed together in one room and this is on the same level as all the female students while the male students stayed in rooms on another level. \n\nDuring the first night, someone knocked on the door of the teachers room. One of them peeked through the pinhole but there wasnt anyone there. Soon after, they received a call on the room phone. She answered the call but only a rasping voice could be heard on the other end. She hung up. This phone call continued intermittently throughout the night but as teachers they could not not answer because it could be a student having an emergency. \n\nThe next day the teachers questioned the students but everyone denied it was them. During the second night, the teachers got the call again but this time it was really one of their students saying there is someone knocking on their door but they could not see anyone through the peephole. The teacher obviously told them dont answer the door and to sleep. A few more students called during the night with the same issue but one of the students reported that she CAN see a light skinned man through the peephole but he is facing down like not looking up whatsoever. That is the only student who saw someone through the peephole. \n\nThe third night, one of the teachers couldnt take it anymore and she braved herself to stand at the corridor of her floor at night when everyone has gone to bed. So she carried her handphone with her and told her colleague to call her if there is anything. So while patrolling, her colleague called her to say there is someone knocking on their room door but she is standing in the corridor and could not see anyone there. \n\nLater on, they found out a swedish man died in one of the rooms of that hotel. \n\nUghhhhhhh",

The entrance to my house is elevated by a 2-step concrete platform.\n\nI was sitting cross legged on the floor in the living room, doing my homework on a low table when suddenly I had a feeling I was being watched. I glanced to my right and there it was, a face of someone who is probably in her 70s, perched on the corridor window. I turned away and stared at my homework for a long time, thinking wtf did I just see. When I glanced back, it was gone.\n\nNow, I am 1.8m tall and even I am unable to look over the window from outside my flat if I don't tiptoe.

I've got a few \"experiences\" at the former Mediacorp campus and this is the well-known doppelg\u00e4nger entity that mimics people - we have never seen its face. \n\n\n1) I had to deliver tapes (now you know how old I am) to the transmission building as part of my role, and usually these tapes get checked for any glitches by the tech team before the tapes are sent to be broadcasted. The uncles checking the tapes are usually regulars with their individual rooms, and we all know them very well. One day, when I was delivering a tape to the uncle (let's call him Uncle X), he was staring at the monitor playback and ignored me when I greeted him. So I  told him I'll leave it on his trolley and went my merry way. The next day, my boss asked me where was the tape and if I've sent it off to be checked. I said yes and I've passed it to Uncle X in is room. I even spoke to him about the tape. My boss went pale suddenly and said, \"Uncle X was on MC yesterday. There was no one in his room the whole day.\" \n\n2) The radio block is haunted af. My ex-colleague told me that there was once they were waiting for a guest to arrive to the studio, and you can only be let in by using the intercom (directly outside the studio) to tell the people inside that you need to be let inside. So they were preparing for the show, and the intercom buzzed. The guest had arrived and she said to please open the studio door for her. When he went to open the door, there was no one standing outside. Moments later, down the long-ass corridor, said guest arrived and was making her way down the hallway, and she happily shouted \"wah, how you know I've arrived?\" And my ex-colleague went: \"Didn't you ping us on the intercom earlier?\" The guest said no, and that she had just reached. My ex-colleague swore that the voice from the intercom sounded exactly like the guest, down to the way she was speaks. \n\n3) The indoor set is also haunted af. The toilet beside it is the nastiest creepiest place ever, like those old school toilets with the mini 3cm by 3cm square tiles pasted from floor to ceiling. I had to help out a shoot there and needed to pee so I went there and was praying no one will disturb me. When I came out, I bumped into one of the actress and she seemed to be looking for something, so I said \"toilet is here!\" and she turned to me and shook her head saying \"no, no one goes to that toilet ever.\" and then she hurried off. I only learnt about it much later that that toilet is infamously haunted and no one has used it in many years, hence the nastiness of it.",

It was the General Election period and I was tasked with heading to office before anyone else entered the newsroom to turn the lights, computers and tvs on. \n\nSo usually I\u2019d reach the newsroom by 6am. It had a open office sorta layout that was split into two halves - when you enter the main doors, there are some frames/plants etc, and then the cubicles are clustered in the left and right of the main area. \n\nI was seated at the left area, but had to go throughout the office to turn everything on. Already felt like I wasn\u2019t alone whenever I did this, but I would quickly turn on the lights and screens then head back to my table. I\u2019d leave all the tvs on mute except the one nearest to my desk, so that the office didn\u2019t feel so silent. \n\nAfter that, I\u2019d wait about half an hour before the first staff (cleaning aunties) arrived. There was one day where after everything was done, I started to hear a photocopy machine on the far end of the right side of the office power up and start printing stuff. \n\nIgnored it at first, because young me just thought that someone had scheduled the machine to print at that timing the night before, but it went on for a good 10 mins..so I finally decided to walk over to see what was going on. \n\nAs I approached the direction of the sounds, things went silent. I went to the photocopy machine at the far end (there were only two, one closer to where I was, which wasn\u2019t turned on, so I assumed it was this one) and found out the machine wasn\u2019t printing - the main power wasn\u2019t even turned on. \n\nI was starting to feel uncomfortable so I unplugged the machine and quickly went back to my desk at the left side. A few mins later, I heard the sound of the machine printing again. This time I just got up and left the office, sat outside there until one of the cleaner aunties came. She saw me and didn\u2019t even question what I was doing out there, she just looked like she knew lol. \n\nStill get chills till this day thinking about it!",

You may ask, is it not more scary at night? Well I can say that as someone who has gone through NS, and frequent this place a lot during my NS time and know the general way around it, I don't really get the spooks easily from this place. \n\nBut one night, I did. So happened that I'ved crossed the long stretch from Ama Keng and realised I've dropped my small pouch somewhere on the road behind me. So I made an illegal u turn as there is hardly any cars there. Since the road is big my headlights will easily shine anything that glints like my keys on my small pouch. Very easy, I saw it not 2 mins later and stopped on the spot to pick it up. \n\nAfter a cursory check I simply clip it back to a safer spot on my bike and began to turn my bike. As I was turning I thought I saw something white flew above my head like a big bird. I have full face helmet on so it's very hard to see what's above my head so I open my visor. \n\nIn hindsight, I should've just rode away as fast as possible and ignore. What I saw was a bloody figure consisting of a bloody head and dripping red liquid from I assume it's fangs. The rest of the body is just a white ragged cloth thingy. \n\nI felt faint but read Abit of prayers and found my strength again and then I just vroom out of there as fast as possible until I reach Jalan Bahar...",

That was for me and my buddies at least. \n\nThere is this famous stretch of road from the guard house to the ammo dump, where the moment you step foot in, you lost all signal on both your walkie talkie and handphone. So you are really forced to just chat with your guard buddy while walking up and down this stretch of badly lighted up road. \n\nThe day of the guard duty was quite special and also a really unfortunate day for many of us, or at least for me and my guard buddy. A bunch of us were chosen as guard because we got gold for our IPPT, and it's supposed to be early book out for us the next day, while the rest of the company stays back for another IPPT retest.\n\n6 of us volunteered for school 4 ammo dump, attracted by the possibility of sleeping in a air-conditioned room. Loaded ourselves up the tonner, and arrived to a guard post situated before a fork road. I remember being part of the 2nd shift. First round of guard duty for us was normal, we had fun, smoked, and chatted while walking up and down. It was near the end of my shift did we receive a bad news, that our entire company will be staying back because they decided to enforce a route march session on Saturday morning due to the company missing out on one route march a week prior. This killed the entire vibe, from a supposed early bookout on Friday morning, to a late bookout eating into our weekends. \n\nAfter our allocated rest time, my buddy and I prepared ourselves for the 2nd shift. I remember clearly it was the 2 am shift. Same thing, we started walking down the stretch of road, 5minutes into our patrol, a sudden rain came. We then took out our gortex jacket to keep ourselves dry and warm (Those that have worn this would understand that while it's not difficult to unfold and wear, it's still really troublesome especially when you are wearing your vest and holding on to a shield and baton.) The moment we put it on, the rain stopped. Talk about luck, so we decided to keep our jacket and continue with our patrol. The usual happy chatter and light-hearted topics turned heavy. Maybe because we were tired. On the way back from the ammo dump, a SUV drove past us. We were puzzled as to why people will be returning their ammo at that timing, but shrugged it off thinking it's normal beyond BMT. So as we were about to complete our first round, near the end of the signal-less stretch, we came across a family of wild board. The bigger ones seemed highly agitated, probably because they were with their youngs. We froze on our tracks with bated breath but luckily for us the wild board left us alone. \n\nSo far so good, a series of unfortunate events and the both of us were still alive. The wild board encounter kind of lifted our spirits a little, maybe because we thought how close we were to getting injured. Our light-hearted topics resumed and we started on our 2nd round back to the ammo dump. On the way back, we saw the SUV drove out, and thought nothing much of it. Until when we were about to reach the ammo dump. As we were both chatting, and you know how when you chat sometimes you would look towards your friend, I noticed a person standing outside the gated ammo dump, facing towards the forest. \n\nWearing new number 4, his skin was pale, boots were shiny, he had a bowl hair cut. Clean fatigue, hunched shoulders looking into the forest. My initial thought is that the SUV probably dropped someone off and he's smoking outside. But, the moment we both crossed this tree that was in between us and the pale guy, he disappeared. \n\nI remember my buddy asking me what happened, because I went quiet all of a sudden, and told him that everything is fine, we should walk faster. He knew. I did told him about what I saw when we are back at the guard house. \n\nWhen the duty ended, another party told us that they encounter something near the area I saw the pale guy. As someone who is not superstitious, I like to attribute that encounter to a hallucination due to me being too tired, but it was a nice horror encounter story once in awhile.",

I tried taking a picture with my finger there but the condensation looked different from what I took.\n\nWhen I look at the picture, you can make out the shape of a face\n\nI cannot scientifically explain what happened and what could have caused that mist shape. Amituofo, I hope whatever person I took a picture of may rest in peace.\n\nAll images I set to auto del after 1 day. Sorry! Didn't want to keep being contacted by people.\n\nImage 1 - the one with the face at the right side\nhttps://ibb.co/hxytcGD9\n\nImage 2 - the one where it was moving away\nhttps://ibb.co/4w3Q1HS8\n\nImage 3 - the \"mist\" is almost gone but still there on the right.\nhttps://ibb.co/rGS24pJC\n\nFAQ\n\nEh why so dark?\nThe picture is dark cause I use flash, we are deep in the jungle so the light condition wasn't the best.\n\nEh why got the dots?\nIt was drizzling. So captured rain drops.\n\nEh why cold?\nI noticed the temperature drop but I didn't connect the 2 together until I saw the first picture. I watch a lot of ghost shows like ghost hunters and TAPS back when it was a thing. They mention that the ghost draw energy around to manifest.\n\nEh so you believe in ghost? \nSort of the curious about the afterlife but never a true believer. But to be honest I don't really know.",

At night, I woke up to go to the toilet. Went to the cubicle closest to the toilet entrance and didn't close the door. I heard footsteps, like somebody wearing wooden clogs circling around the toilet. The footsteps were getting louder and closer. \nclack. clack. clack. clack. clack.\n\nMy bladder was super full and i couldn't rush it out. Not like you could stop halfway idk about other guys. The footsteps stopped right behind me. My whole body was cold. Chills throughout my body. Still peeing I turned my head. Nothing behind me. My head was still facing backwards(didn't want to get jump scared hahahaha), the footsteps began to walk away from me to loop around the toilet again. Quickly washed my hands and gtfo of there. Could still hear the footsteps as i left the toilet. Lucky never followed me back to bunk. \n\nHappened to me twice. The second time i just ignored the clogs footsteps. Still felt chills but was too tired to be scared. Did my business and went to sleep. Mans gotta wake up and do 5bx \n\nTldr. Sasuke walking laps in the NSTI toilet",

My Section got assigned a room on the top floor (level 5 iirc). There were around 10 to 13 of us in the bunk. On our first night there, the lockers started shaking by themselves even though the main door to the bunk was closed - so it could not have been the wind. \n\nI kid you not, the entire bunk woke up and looked at each other from around the room. We ended up placing our field packs against the locked doors and placing our berets (with the crest) under our pillows. \n\n  \nThe next morning when we shared our experience with our platoon-mates from the neighboring bunks, they also had similar experiences such as the bunk doors opening and closing by themselves and hearing giggles from the toilet at night. \n\n  \nThis was legit the first time my buddy and I ever accompanied each other to the toilet at night LOL.",

I was at the rear with a close cousin of mine, and as we were ascending, at the corner of my eye, I saw a white figure flash past really quickly at the base of the stairs.\n\nFrightened, and seeking confirmation on what I saw, I turned to said cousin, who only raised his finger to his lips and pointed upwards.\n\nAs we were on the top and the rest of the group were fooling around and scaring each other at the top, my cousin said to me in a low voice, \"don't talk about this now, later when we're outside\".\n\nWasn't the superstitious type, but I kinda got the gist that talking about them would probably make them more fascinated and follow us, so I kept mum as we eventually exited the boardwalk.\n\nIt was then my cousin said yes, he saw the same thing I did, and since he's somewhat \"sensitive\" to these things, as the group was mingling on top of the tower, he noticed the same white figure standing very still at the bottom via his peripheral vision. Seemingly just staring at us.\n\nI asked whether it followed us as we left the boardwalk, he said as we were walking back, he kept spotting it in the trees. Somewhat like bloody Monkey King in DOTA.\n\nI don't know if he was pulling my leg, but I knew that I developed a really bad fever after the chalet. Lasted for a week or so.\n\nNow, I joke about it with him saying that probably that thing was pissed because it was the equivalent of dropping by to someone's house in the wee hours of the morning for an uninvited party, haha.",

As he did, he suddenly felt something tug at him from the water. He had to struggle to keep his balance. At that moment, we all sensed that something wasn\u2019t right. Without saying much, we bolted down the stairs in a panic.\n\nOddly enough, the gate we had climbed over was now unlocked. We just opened it and ran straight back to the chalet.\n\nBack at the chalet, the air felt unusually chilly.

It was about 11 plus pm. We stopped along the slope and got some rest. You know how shiok it feels when you are resting with your field pack/alice pack on your back and you are facing downslope right.. i think everyone was just so tired they KO on the spot. Me and my buddy though were side by side.. leaning against our packs and enjoying the breeze.. the moon was full so the downslope of the hill was actually well lit by the moonligt for us to have a good view of it..btw left and right of the slope were all thick vegetation and trees..\n\nWe were just gazing across the slope when we saw a silhouette figure walking out of the vegetation onto the rocky path away from us (i.e.downwards).\n\nThe moonlight shined on its figure very clearly..what we both saw was a figure with a very curvacious outline of a female body. It looked like those ladies you see dressed in cheongsam and walking with hips swaying left and right.. it seemed to have long hair fraying out at shoulder level...arms swaying by the side.\n\nMy buddy and I were just ogling at the figure when we both sort of realized wtf we are in tekong le wth is a lady doing here???? I kept damn quiet and wanted to just let the whole episode pass but my buddy shouted \"hello?\".. the figure then stopped walking, sort of gave that shocked body jolt and suddenly walked super fast downslope.. and it was during this time because of the way it sped away and towards the vegetation, it was so haunting to see that we both almost cried in fear...\n\nSo many years liao..i can now confess that night i heck care and just peed in my uniform without even bothering to walk to vegetation..",

That afternoon, a friend of ours just came back from a long trip and we immediately meet up.\n\nNotes before continuing: \n- a friend who just moved in to a new flat (E). \n- a friend who just came back after a long trip (M).\n- E & M weren't that close and didnt really talk to much.\n\nThe three of us went ahead to eat at a nearby hawker centre at E's new home and eventually went to his room to chill.\n\nAfter just a short while, M urged me that we should go back home. Seeing it was almost his curfew, I thought he was just worried to get home late. \n\nWe walked to the bus stop and his not really responding to any convo.

There were rumours at the time that the office was haunted, usually discussed among the other NSFs - something about a monk or a girl roaming about. We\u2019re an operational unit, so there\u2019ll always be people on duty and we\u2019re assigned overnight shifts at least once a week.\n\nI\u2019ve never experienced anything odd in particular during my time as an NSF - outside camp, yes. I\u2019m also the type to confront anything spiritually evil that I see. I believe, like people, you got to match their freak or be freakier if you want them out of your life.\n\nSo one night, some of the NSFs decided to spend their resting time in the training room, a room less utilised, and therefore, quieter and darker than most. It\u2019s a nice room to sleep in despite the desks and chairs. I was already senior at the time, so I had to spend the rest of the night in the Ops room.\n\nAround 4AM, the juniors ran to me shaken and distressed, telling me they heard the ghost of the monk chanting. I got curious, so after dismissing them to another place to rest, I personally went to the training room to investigate.\n\nInterestingly enough, I DID hear some kind of chanting noise. But as I got closer to what I sense was the source, I found that the groaning and droning was from the old air conditioning system on the ceiling.\n\nAnyway, when the juniors found I went to investigate, they asked me if I saw or experienced anything strange. With a straight face, I told them \u201cYes, I saw the silhouette of a monk at the corner of the room and bailed the moment I saw the ghost.\u201d\n\nNow, every junior is talking about it even in the day shift, and I doubt anyone realised it wasn\u2019t real. I really enjoyed how stories like this develop into their own thing - kinda like mass hysteria.",

In the middle of the night one day, he heard some weird sounds coming from the kitchen where the lights were off. When he went closer to take a look, he saw his helper standing there guzzling up raw food from the fridge in a..err.. very non-human like manner. He hurried off.

                "body": "Man this has been such a good thread, I'd feel bad if I didn't contribute. Here's a very unusual story that I heard towards the end of my NS days; it's definitely not your typical army ghost story, so take it with a huge pinch of salt.\n\nIt was the tail end of my unit's time as NSFs about 15 years ago and we were doing our ATEC 2 in Wallaby. After the gruelling exercise, everyone was happy, clean (as can be in the outback) and we spent the evening in our tents trading stories. The weirdest story came from the PC runners (R) and according to his account, the night of our exercise went something like this:\n\nC coy's platoon 7 was the point platoon of our battalion, and as we were a heliborne unit, P7 kick-started the exercise by taking a short chopper ride to their designated drop off point. After exiting the chopper, they formed up and lay prone on the grass while the chopper made its exit. As he was laying down, R inexplicably felt a tiredness take over him and he closed his eyes for a few seconds of shuteye. When he opened his eyes, he saw most of his platoon running off in front of him into the bush, so he quickly picked up his belongings and followed suit. When he reunited with the main body, he asked around \"hey, where's platoon 7 ah?\" and the soldiers there (whose faces he could not make out clearly because it was really dark) pointed him to the front \"R, that way\". So following the people who were not from his platoon (who else could they have been if 7 was point platoon?) but somehow knew his name, he went on his way to try and find his people.\n\nNow this was where things got even stranger. These were some of the things he claimed he saw on his walk, perhaps in increasing order of strangeness:\n- Recce team who got lost in the bush. When they asked him if he knew the way to the next reporting line, R apparently answered \"No, but I can take you there\" and just kept walking\n- Little Green Men. Yes, you heard me. They were apparently waist-high, had large bulbous foreheads like luohan fish, and had skin that glowed green like glowsticks. They walked in groups of 3 to 5, and were following R, always keeping a few metres away.\n- Something in a Red Hood. Behind the Little Green Men was a tall figure in a red hood which seemed to float along in silence. When R tried to get a better look at what was inside, all he saw was blackness.\n\nThat's where R's story ended because he couldn't remember how, when or where exactly he wound up reunited with his platoon. So we asked around to see who found him when one of the 3SGs asked R, \"You really can't remember how we found you?\" \n\n\"Nope\" \n\nSo according to this 3SG, they eventually found R in a daze, just walking in a straight line. R did not respond to the sergeant calling out his name, and when the 3SG tried to grab him by the shoulders from the front, R just. kept. walking. The 3SG was actively pushing back and R still kept walking like the 3SG wasn't there. Finally, 3SG gave him a good slap across the face and that's when it seemed like R finally \"woke up\" from his stupor. \n\nSince then, we've tried our best to form theories of what the whole experience could have really been. Was R just sagged out of his mind the whole night? Could the Little Green Men and the Red Hooded Figure have just been cyalume sticks placed along the path by the scouts? Apparently not likely, as the scouts were not given red sticks and had to use other colours to demarcate danger areas. Whatever it was, we eventually accepted the fact that we were in a foreign land, training in areas with very very few humans, and therefore having strange things happen at night was definitely within the realm of possibility. To date, I've not heard any other similar stories from people who have been to Wallaby, so it could also just be one man's really tired night out. But he was so serious when recounting his weird adventure that I thought it deserved to be told anyway, unusual as it is.",

He opted for a run down motel instead to save on his cost.\n\nWhen he arrived, he got the keys from reception and walk towards his room. As he passed by a door, he heard silent weeping through the flimsy old doors. His curiosity got the better of him and he peeked through the keyhole and saw the silhouette of a woman with long hair, sitting on the bed facing opposite his direction towards the window. He realized he was being nosy, stopped looking and walked towards to his room.\n\n  \nThe next day he got up early for his meeting, came back home at around midnight, this time he passed the door where he saw the lady in the room the previous night. Curious, he peeked through again, but could not see anything as it seems the lady had placed a red paper to cover the keyhole. Embarassed at the thought of the lady knowing that he had been peeking secretly, he walked away quickly to his room.\n\n  \nOn the 3rd night he was hungry and wanted to go buy dinner, he passed by the room he saw the lady, and only heard silence this time round. His curiosity got the better of him, and he again look through the keyhole to only see something red blocking his view. His curiosity turned into concerned as he wondered if the lady was ok, so he approached the staff counter and asked about the room the lady was staying in. \n\nThe staff looked at him in complete shock and said that the room had been empty for years, as there was an apparent suicide in there. However he shared reports of guests encountering a female spirit with eyes completely red.\n\n  \nEyes completely red.\n\n  \nWhen he put two and two together, he quickly ran back to his room, packed his stuffs and moved to another hotel paying 3x more what he paid for the motel.

So basically im all alone in this huge ass terrace house. So im sitting at the sofa facing the large tv infront of me, and on my back is the large front door, and further down on my left is my grandmas room, kitchen and the stairs to the second floor. And then on my right is the huge window facing the garage and the gate. So I basically felt a little uneasy and I just couldn\u2018t keep my eyes down on my Ipad so I, decided to just open the front door and leave it open. So after leaving the front door open, Im sitting down on the sofa and I swore from the sight of my eye, I saw a black thing dash quickly pass the front door on the outside. Ok lah, maybe I see wrongly, so I went back and watch my ipad. And then again from the side of my eyes, that freakin thing zoom pass from the exact same spot again\u2026. I freak tf out and ran out of house. I stood right next to the gate and waited for 2 hours before they came back.

Bus D operates between Beach Station and the VivoCity shopping complex.\n\n>TTS will take on the bus and maintenance services on Oct 1, and the operation of the Sentosa Beach Shuttle from Jan 1, 2026. The beach shuttle operates in a circular route, with 18 stops across the island, and runs at a frequency of 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nBasically TTS will take over the contract from Comfort Delgro but the news didn't specify the time for Bus D (linking Sentosa and Vivo).  The current arrangement for this route is just a one-way shuttle every Friday to Sunday from 6 to 9pm so if TTS regularise it then it would be a great news too.",

Ofc it's the right thing to report, but students are afraid of getting targeted by bullies as well.  Some bullies are rich kids too who threaten the kids with their parent's social status.  The school NEEDS TO take proactive action and give out harsh punishment to demonstrate that they care about the issue.

Parents these days are busy working and outsourced the parenting to phones, helpers and grandparents. That is not saying parents themselves are perfect role models, but with all that outsourcing, one can imagine how children will turn out without proper guidance.\n\nThere are only adults on the internet. No matter you are 30 or you are 3, you are an adult. The exposure to social media for kids is bad. School is an easy scapegoat for what happens at home. My teacher used to say \u201cyou\u2019re with me for half a day for 4 years but you\u2019re at home way longer\u201d. \n\nIf parents do not stop giving excuses \u201coh u dunno lah i work long hours so tired\u201d to justify not being involved, then we will see this rot deepen. Being involved isnt just about looking at what your child learn, results how good, need enrichment and tuition or not and etc. Unfortunately if you see conversations in parenting groups, the focus is almost always academic related.\n\nCan teachers do more? Yes and no. Teachers are bounded by how firm management is. I can imagine some school management are firm and tough on bullying but some are just wishy washy. It could be a situation where the teacher wants to do more also cannot.",

Problem with this, of course, is that said printer will just sit there for the in-between periods. Likely only the bigger parties can justify this kind of expense. \n\nThat said, I would be surprised if any party, especially the smaller opposition parties, hit their spending caps.",

The bottom line is it's a $500 increase for spending up to 25k, and that $500 is covered by the CDC vouchers.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd for lower income folks they get ADDITIONAL up to $850 **cash**. Which means they don't have to spend it to get the benefits (unlike CDC) that $850 can go to their savings or investments\n\n\n> All of us will still be paying it forever.\n\n\nYes that's true. However it should be noted that a) the vouchers over and above GSTV (eg CDC, u save) have never been stopped yet so far. They could be, but that would be a new precedent. b) GSTV are **permanent**. They are literally written in the same law as GST itself. So while we will be paying the increased GST forever, those who qualify will also receive the GSTV forever. (Ok yes PAP can change the law and even the constitution any time, but if we're going to go to that level then no law is valid, then no need to talk about anything liao)",

As another commentator suggested, just write down the channel numbers ur dad is interested in and keep it nearby. \n\nMy default is usually CNN. When I off the TV and turn it on again, it will automatically go to the last watched channel (in my case CNN). So when I wake in the morning, I just turn on the TV, n let it run. Easy peasy.",

And according to this list the most dangerous are plastic bags which are found in even greater quantity than straws. I can't think of a single logical reason for only straws to be removed due to environmental wildlife hazard concerns.\n\nThe problem isn't that plastic straws exist, but that they are ending up in our oceans due to illegal waste dumping or people polluting near the sea.

It is simply unrealistic to convince 3 billion people of anything, including enjoyable things, like \"hey watch this funny 5 sec video of a cat\".\n\n- The only realistic way to get 3 billion people to do anything is through government regulation (and even that is not perfect; see: COVID responses). \n\n- So if you're getting governments and authorities involved, it would be weird for them to use all their regulatory power to ban seafood instead of addressing the actual problem of discarded fishing nets. Isn't that a much easier and more straightforward approach?\n\nSeafood consumption is not inherently linked to discarded fishing nets. Humans were eating seafood for millennia without discarding any nets. Decreased consumption could even potentially increase the problem - such as if fisheries close and dump all their gear in the ocean. The problem (in this context) isn't seafood consumption, but discarded nets. People may wish to stop seafood consumption for other reasons, ethical or otherwise, but it's not specifically going to help the net situation. Even if everyone were to stop eating seafood today, those nets won't disappear.\n\n> For us, one of the best things we can do is actually improve our recycling etiquette if we are really concerned about plastics. \n\nThe best thing would be for the government to regulate companies' use of disposables (be it plastic or paper). A lot of places give disposables even when you're eating there, which is incredibly wasteful. Schools should also start young and teach children to be responsible and not use more than they need: to Reduce consumption, Reuse items where possible, and when there is no alternative, to Recycle correctly. Recycling was supposed to be the last option, not the first. There's a lot more that can be done in education. So many Singaporeans still wrongly believe we use landfills and that biodegradable items or single-use paper are better for the environment when both are worse than single-use plastic in our context.\n\nI believe in going straight to the top where the problem begins and stopping it there, rather than messily convincing billions of people to do things they don't want that may possibly send signals that may possibly lead to change.\n\nI personally do many very inconvenient things because I believe in the value of it, so this isn't me being lazy, but I also know that my individual actions to be more sustainable won't actually solve any problem.",

Our global economy is literally built upon consumption, and governments globally get worried if consumption decreases because that will affect the GDP. Either consumption is bad or it isn't, you cannot have it both ways.\n\nSo, you are wrong on seafood consumption being not the issue. Yes, people have consumed seafood for millenia, but at what scale? People never went deep into the ocean to do large-scale fishing. That is different from what we have now because of how many people consume seafood. Also, there are plenty of other reasons why seafood consumption is bad like you mentioned.\n\nThe root cause of the problem for fishing nets is consumption. If you just farming in local fisheries not deep in the ocean, there wouldn't be this global fishing net issue. However, we consume so much fish that it is impossible to sustain with local fisheries alone. Then the argument that if we stop fishing companies will dump in the ocean. I am sorry but didn't you mention that WWF recommended changes to fishing gear? So, can't they just recommend companies not dump in the ocean?\n\nAs for your counter argument to my recycling point. I already said we don't dump plastic in the oceans like other countries. We incinerate everything. If there is any reason to reduce consumption it certainly isn't because plastics are entering the oceans but rather we are running out of space in Semakau landfills. Which brings to your point about we don't use landfills. Actually, we do just not the traditional ones overseas.\n\nAs for consumption of disposable plastics, again you cannot have it both ways. Either consumption is bad or it isn't.  If you think consuming plastics is bad and needs to be reduced then the same applies for large scaling fishing. Both have environmental impacts.\n\nYour argument still emphasises what I said, people are only environmentally friendly if it is convenient for them. Reducing plastic use = thumbs up. Reducing seafood consumption = insert reason. The truth of the matter is that demonising plastic use is easier compared to large scale fishing. \n\nAnd lastly, I don't even know why the conversation has derailed this far. My original point was the war on plastic straws is an extremely useless endeavour. It does nothing to help at all other than get Instagram likes.\n\nGiven that you want to go the root of the issue, then more the reason to stop with this vendetta against plastic straws, which does nothing. Let us have our plastic straw and educate people to consume less, like you said. I only get drinks outside a few times a month. That does more than me struggling with a paper straw during the few times I enjoy a drink.",

My point was that in the specific problem of nets, it\u2019s the fisheries who have the most control and who are thus best placed to target the problem, so if we want to solve the issue it makes sense to go straight to them.\n\nLikewise we should target plastic producers, not customers, hence my point on government regulation being the best approach. \n\nI think it is less efficient to focus on curbing individual consumption, vs collective consumption (where education comes in), engaging in activism or working hard to be in a position to change policies for large scale positive impact, as some of my friends have done and which I also hope to do, and have done on a smaller scale with other issues.\n\nI really don\u2019t want this to be a fight; I\u2019m just often frustrated by how the time and energy that well-meaning people pour into regulating their own behaviour could be better spent targeting the problem directly at the policy level.",

Having too much of these drinks is bad for health anyway, and having one in a plastic cup when I want to pains my conscience. Compared to those selling the drinks, I\u2019d like to think consumers have more of a choice since making lifestyle changes tend to have less barriers (and if any most of them are about mindsets).",

Knn buy one salad, plastic bowl, plastic lid, croutons wrapped separately, fork wrapped separately, sauce in another plastic, another lid, and so on. Or you buy a pack of Biscoff or something and see the plastic produced.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s just plastic when paper is pound for pound even more damaging to the environment (particularly chemicals), and metal is also damaging in many ways but nobody go after wasteful foil uses and so on.",

If MHA says we pass, I will have no doubt in my mind that the results are rigged. \n\nSingaporeans are one of the most oblivious and passive bunch of people in the world due to the top down approach from our government, sch and even the freaking army. Add to that the fact that Sg is one of the safest places on Earth and also the fact that most Singaporeans do not like to be at the centre of attention and you have a recipe for disaster when disaster strikes. \n\nI will never forget the time a fire alarm went off in a shopping mall while I was in the movie theater. I was the only one to step out to check if it was a false alarm or an actual fire. Literally no one else in the whole theater did anything but continue watching the movie. \n\nAlso the time a fight broke out on the LRT and everyone just stared while I stepped in to break up the fight. Both times I was thinking that we are fucked if something serious hits. Like literally, no one gives a flipping shit.",

Let's not forget that some Singaporean social media users took this opportunity to film themselves still eating in a restaurant while everyone runs out of the building or complained about not getting a cab and had to walk back to the hotel on a separate occasion. \n\nInstances like this should not be reflective of the entire Singaporean population. But such bad behavioural traits really reflect poorly on us as a nation should the worst happens. We really need a lot of soul-searching as we have taken safety for granted in favour of money, career and academic success. Yet, we have not demonstrated sufficient empathy for those who have been through real life natural disasters or tragically lost their loved ones in war.",

There are many ways to avoid them\n\n* Typically I will avoid eye contact, look at my phone and pretend to be in a hurry so that they don't ask me. \n* If they still ask me, I politely but firmly tell them that I don't do cash donations and instead prefer donating online on giving.sg. Usually they will not question at this point.\n* A few times, the volunteer told me that giving.sg takes a cut of the donation as processing fees (while claiming that if you donate to the volunteers, 100% of the money goes to the charity). In such a case, I say that I still prefer donating via giving.sg since I can keep track of my donations. Many charities have income tax benefits and to claim these, we need to submit our IC number, which is something I would rather submit on the portal as opposed to letting a volunteer write it down. As for the \\~2% cut taken as processing fees, I can understand that but I cannot fix the problem.\n\nJust need to be polite and firm to handle situations like these. Avoid being guilt tripped. If you have spent more than a minute talking, just say that you are in a hurry and must move on. \n\nPersonally I do donate to charities (verified ones only) since I think it is for a common good, but I will only donate online. I also often check the charity's annual report to see how much money they are spending on fund raising activities and salaries of the directors. If the proportion is more than a certain amount, I will avoid donating to them.",

This master plan follows a public engagement exercise that began in October 2023, where feedback was gathered from citizens. It aims to shape the city\u2019s future development, with a focus on sustainability, decentralisation, and enhanced liveability.\n\nAmong the key proposals are new housing developments in central locations such as Bukit Timah Turf City, Mount Pleasant, the former Keppel Golf Course, and Marina South. These are part of efforts to inject more residential spaces into the city\u2019s core. At the same time, the government is pushing for decentralisation, spotlighting Jurong Lake District as Singapore\u2019s largest mixed-use district outside the traditional Central Business District.\n\nThe plan also involves further development of regional hubs like Changi Aviation Park, Changi City, Tampines, and Punggol Digital District. In terms of recreation and environmental initiatives, the public was consulted on a new recreation master plan, which includes upgrades to parks and public spaces, as well as a massive 800-hectare land reclamation project called \u201cLong Island\u201d along the eastern coast.\n\nSpeaking at the i Light Singapore festival at Marina Bay, Minister Chee Hong Tat reflected on the success of Marina Bay, which was envisioned in the 1970s as a city expansion anchored in sustainability. He noted that Marina Bay today serves as a model for future developments\u2014an integrated, modern hub supporting Singapore\u2019s ambitions as a global business and financial centre.",

But so do many many people I've seen working in the last few decades. People are just so eager/quick to find excuses/scapegoats that they refuse to own up to anything. And when they do, inevitably it's some half-assed apology like \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" or \"I'm sorry if you didn't understand the communication\" instead. \n\nEither that or do what he did in this case, silently change and either pretend it didn't happen or gaslight into thinking it never actually happened. It's such a pity that accountability is so rare these days.",

And he was factually wrong (claiming the place was shuttered when it wasn't) and there's no wiggle room for misinterpretation. So the correct response is only a simple \"I misstated and got it wrong.\", that's it. The fact that he wouldn't even own such a simple factual mistake (and again, this is not uncommon behaviour unique to him at all based on the people I've interacted with over the decades) is aggravating to me.",

One flaw in his character that has always stood out to me is that he is someone who goes to great lengths to deliberately find fault with the PAP, even where there is objectively no fault to be found. This is just one of the examples of such; where he fabricated the closure of this particular store in order to paint the Government in a bad light.\n\nHaving attended his Sembawang West rally this GE, it was clear from his speech that in all his years of patrolling Bukit Batok SMC, the faults in estate management which he found were few and far between. They consisted mainly of the Town Council's failure to install a pedestrian walkway along a certain road, as well as their failure to refill the fire extinguishers at one of the blocks in the estate. The former was honestly not a worthy talking point for a GE rally at all, and yet he held it up like it was some kind of critical flaw which showed Murali Pillai to be fatally incompetent at managing his ward.\n\nDr Chee is someone who has a naturally critical eye and is capable of scrutinizing the PAP's governance and exposing its flaws. However, he needs to learn what it is that is *worth* criticizing about the PAP, and needs to learn to not stretch out trivial points such as these -- and should certainly not fabricate evidence for the sake of making such points.",

One needs to look no further than their own website's main About page, which describes the PAP as \"an all-powerful, uncaring, and elitist ruling party.\" \n\nYet, what Dr Chee lacks in objectivity and the ability to make fair characterisations, he more than makes up for in his genuine and unwavering dedication to Singaporeans. His willingness to walk the ground and serve residents, with no salary, and with the PAP constantly attempting to thwart his efforts and ruin his image, signals his worthiness to enter into Parliament. The work he did in the former Bukit Batok SMC for precisely $0 a month in remuneration is enough to give most if not all of the PAP's back-benchers a run for their money; and his rare and unusual dedication is precisely why the PAP is so afraid of him.\n\nP.S. It's also for this reason that I unfortunately believe the SDP will die out after Dr Chee retires -- he's the only one of the lot that is actually whole-heartedly committed to serving Singaporeans. The rest of them, like James Gomez and Gigene Wong, are just a bunch of clowns riding on Dr Chee's coattails in an attempt to secure a seat on the PAP hate-train.",

Dr Chee is definitely on the Industrious side of the scale, but it remains to be seen whether he's Smart or Stupid, because he *should* be Smart, but he does all these Stupid things.\n\nAs a reminder of that quote, the Smart Industrious officers are to be recommended to the General Staff.

The WP paints themselves as being a more moderate and conservative political party, whereas the SDP are more like Singapore's \"attack dog\" party -- being interested in scrutinizing each and every decision made by the PAP. While the WP will support PAP policies as long as they are _generally_ positive, the SDP will still pull apart the Government's legislation to find any flaw or defect that exists within it. \n\nThis is why I personally had hoped for Dr Chee to be elected, because I feel that he would actually be extremely useful as a black-hat critic to the PAP's policies -- one which would actually improve the quality of our legislation, provided they actually responded to his critiques. \n\nAnd just to add to this; I personally feel that the Government's internal system of checks and balances to ensure that quality legislation is passed is not totally watertight. One needs only look to the AGC's recent statutory revision exercise in 2020 to see how many gaping flaws continued to be left in key statutes such as the Penal Code, Road Traffic Act and SAF Act even after this self-initiated revisionary exercise.",

While I believe Dr Chee is someone who has the aptitude, the talent, and the courage to effectively critique the PAP's policymaking, I'm also disappointed when he does things such as these that undermine his own credibility. No doubt he has improved a lot since the 1990s and the 2000s, but incidents such as these show that it really can be quite hard for a leopard to change its spots.",

Do you know they aren't guaranteed to buy it back at 40-50 years old?\" Like bruh, what in the non-issue is your issue? It's literally on the stupid contract that you sign to buy the house. It's a major life decision. If you don't know what you bought how is this govt fault now? Sure some people argue that old people signed without reading properly, but still is not govt issue tio bo, you want raise awareness then raise lor, say until like it is govt fault that he is an idiot.\n\nNot all attack dogs are good attack dogs. I dont see much value to hire some uncle that argue over all the 5 cent 10 cent issue in Parliament which he can't even get right sometimes, taking time away from addressing more critical issues.",

Whereas for SG, we\u2019re a global financial powerhouse so that is our \u201cpower\u201d in the world.\n\nOther ministries like education, defense and home affairs also test ministers more than foreign affairs because they deal with day to day issues of Singaporeans, as well as ever evolving external and internal threats to our defense and national security.\n\nEdit: paragraph. Also see u/Mean-Ninja-4620 reply below. Thanks for correcting me!",

And the responsibility of developing our financial hub and markets is under MAS not MOF. But your point stands if you look at who Chairman MAS has been over the years. Finance ministry is important because you control how resources are allocated.",

For example, manufacturing exiting PRC are friend-shoring to nations that are deemed ideologically aligned/similar to the west.

Have they been misadvised by their Spanish lawyer?\n\nOverall, I find that the reporting for this case has been consistently very muddled and unclear all round.  Either Mitchell's defense lawyer is muddled, or Audrey's family's private private prosecution  lawyer is muddled, or the reporting is muddled, or a combination of all 3.",

Maybe they didn't appreciate the legal position? Maybe their Spanish lawyer had failed to take this aspect into account and thus didn't advise them on this possibility? It's anyone's guess.\n\nI'm not inclined to think that MHA has gotten the legal position wrong. They surely would have cleared this statement with AGC or MinLaw before responding to the media queries.",

There was no +65.\n\nAnyway already reported in the scamshield app, so just a heads-up to yall\n\nEdit to add: Those of you who kenna scolded mother father later in the day, sorry ah, maybe it\u2019s because I was one of his first targets for the day and I was extremely curt with him (I was pushing him ~~rudely~~ aggressively to sell me his scam story). Twice. He didn\u2019t scold me. He just gave up, didn't even try to give me his story. What a bloody pussy. ptui! ",

She then claimed they would deduct from Medisave, and I said it didn't make sense cause 1) this isn't medical related and 2) You would also need to login into Singpass to authenticate this sort of thing. \n\nI think she eventually just gave up when I dared her to send an email from NTUC's official email, or threatened to just call the official NTUC customer hotline to check. \ud83d\ude44",

Fair enough. But that's not something every country is willing to offer. Hence why this guy picked a country that does. That in itself brings up the question that not having the death penalty is too lenient hence why it's preferable to do it there. \n\n\nI'm on the side of  the death penalty. I believe if you are willing to intentionally take a life or bring misery to many others for power or profit you should forfeit your life. \n\n\nThat applies to many individuals who sit at the top but I shan't bring politics into it. \n\n\nThe world would be a better place if less people sought to end lives. I'm sure we can both agree on this. But, those that do, should forfeit theirs. Tax payers money shouldn't be used on such individuals. At least not my tax dollars. Imagine if we got to choose where our tax dollars went. You gonna send use yours to reform murderers?

Where do your obligations to humanity lie now? \ud83d\ude0c\n\n\nIf you had 10'000 dollars and I told you little Timmy is gonna lose his arm due to a drunk driver knocking him down without that money or you could feed a convicted murderer through his prison term who killed his wife because he was jealous. Pick one to save? Timmy's arm or this low life's life? \n\n\nNot so simple sparing an immoral convicts life now is it? \n\n\nNow how about I tell you, you can work 6 months and then give both of them 10k each and U get nothing. \n\n\nYou gonna feed that convict? Reform him of the sweat of your back? Or you rather just let him hang since he murdered someone intentionally? \n\n\nThis is what you have to weigh ethically and morally when we talk about the death penalty.
