HDB blocks built up to the 80s and early 90s have just the main lift shaft and the common corridors on select levels (before lift upgrading was implemented), if I\u2019m not wrong. So lifts stopping at every floor\u2014and also multiple lift lobbies at upgraded blocks\u2014even though common nowadays, only started somewhere in the mid/late 90s I believe. (Someone else might know better/more accurately.)\n\nPossible explanations include earlier priority to just house the population in public housing flats as fast as possible, possibly lower budgets (as mentioned by another commenter). And\u2014this is my guess\u2014an efficient way for accommodating different flat types: if I\u2019m not wrong, the common corridor floor units might be slightly smaller/fewer rooms, while the units on the floors without original lift access may be larger/more rooms. (And yes, as in u/bubbler_crab\u2019s experience, some blocks also had dual floor executive maisonette.)\n\nLifts stopping on every floor definitely is more convenient, but also the subsequent lift upgrading for almost all older blocks would also be to take into consideration our ageing population.\n\nRelatedly, there was a recent CNA article about some remaining HDB blocks that can\u2019t be lifted upgraded (or only partially): https://www.channelnewsasia.com/today/ground-up/hdb-lack-lift-access-every-floor-5056871",

Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m supporting the \u201crich\u201d, but then at unmanned points, you augment with double-door system, or some other means to ensure no tailgating.\n\nFor manned points, you jolly well make sure you get a response from the resident before you let the visitor in. That is the entire point of security. It sounds like this Mr Chen is advocating shirking of responsibility.\n\nWhat next, hiring MPs who don\u2019t speak up in Parliament?

I believe my father bought some too, but he was too impatient to hold and he wouldn't discuss these stuff with me. \n\nThen when the former NOL MD became PM, he wanted to share the stock market success with everyone, and overnight, everyone became Singtel shareholders. 1993 was a crazy year. And all bubbles comes to an end, so that bubble ended with 1993, and everyone chased the other bubble, real estate, until the up and coming PM in waiting instituted what was then the first property cooling measures of recent era in 1996.\n\nI always thought it was curious nobody credited him for bursting the bubble before the Asian Financial Crisis. Or perhaps I am ignorant, he caused unnecessary pain to the real estate speculators then?\n\nAnyway, at this point of time, Singapore stock exchange was still hot, and a lot of attention was on Malaysian stocks on what was known as the CLOB.\n\nThen AFC happened, Mahathir fired his Finance and Deputy Prime Minister, some guy named Anwar, instituted currency controls on the ringgit and declared the CLOB illegal and froze all trading and all shares registered on the CLOB would be transferred to a guy named Khan. Singaporean investors were basically Khannibalised, and had to patiently wait for him to transfer the proceeds as he list and sell those shares on the Malaysian exchange.\n\nSo, a hot part of Singapore stock exchange died right there.\n\nThose who think Singapore market lacked volatility are clearly young and not familiar with names like IPC or Soh Chee Wen. Its almost like he would be charged with stock manipulation every few years.\n\nFor a few years, Singapore exchange was full of what we will call meme stock today, stocks that trade with zero bearing to their underlying businesses, and the stock exchange seems confused when it should behave like an exchange and when it should behave like a regulator.\n\nLong story short, a lot of hot stocks will suddenly fail, suddenly fundamentals would matter and Singaporeans start to understand that besides a small number of blue chips, most companies are no better bet than a casino.\n\nAnd as liquidity dried up, even genuinely good growing companies will trade at a discount compared to other exchanges and taking the company private to list in Hong Kong or US was a no brainer, and you can see many successful local names completely skip the listing in Singapore stage.\n\nWorse yet, even if you have a keen eye at stock picking, the inevitable delisting means you will be forced out well before the company can grow 4-10x.  Often, 2-3x is the best one can hope for.\n\nSGX, minus a handful of blue chips, is basically capped upside, and very high chance of 100% loss. Time in this market is almost guaranteed money losing.\n\nThat said, I believe DBS is doing well enough to make US big tech envious.... DBS even had a $1+ dividend payout that coincided with the post liberation day low, which made it looked like it crashed more than it actually did.\n\nI always believe one should only invest in what one knows, and the Singaporean blue chips arent bad investments, esp given the high tax free dividends compared to the US.",
