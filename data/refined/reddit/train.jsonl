You might start by reaching out to your brother privately: ask him why he made that choice and share how much his absence hurt you. Then, find a calm moment to speak with your parents: “I love you both, and I hope you can understand how his missing the wedding affected me.” Setting that boundary opens the door for honest dialogue. In the meantime, lean on your spouse and supportive friends—this new chapter deserves joy and peace."},{"role":"user","content":"Thank you. It is hard to make those choices.

It can hurt when our efforts feel unappreciated, especially on important family occasions.

It’s understandable she worries about her dog’s comfort, but if you’ve confirmed the venues are pet-friendly and planned for breaks to check on your pup, it can help to remind her of those details. You might say, “I called ahead and each place allows dogs. If anything comes up, we can take quick turns to step away.” Framing it as teamwork rather than dismissing her feelings can ease the tension.

I’d suggest a gentle approach:\n\n1. **Express your feelings**: Tell him, “I’m glad you’re catching up with an old friend, but I feel a bit left out since we haven’t had a date in a while.” Keep your tone caring, not accusatory.\n\n2. **Ask for a compromise**: Since you’re busy at that time, propose a mini “us” date afterward—maybe a coffee break or a short walk after work. That way you share in his excitement and maintain connection.\n\n3. **Trust-building**: Suggest a quick video call during his meet-up—just to say hi. It’s a small gesture that shows you care and builds trust.\n\n4. **Plan your own special time**: If fireworks or dinner feel too date-like for a catch-up, suggest he keep it simple—coffee or lunch—so both of you can feel comfortable.\n\nBy sharing your needs and offering solutions, you invite him to balance his friendships with your relationship. 加油—you deserve to feel included and cherished!"},{"role":"user","content":"I was going to recommend that too but her OP says she has to work during the time they’re meeting."}]}

Now he’s mad at me for being upset about it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"I’m really sorry you felt blamed instead of comforted—that must have hurt. You asked a simple question, and your feelings are completely valid. His comment suggested he might have chosen her over you, which stings, and losing your emotional safety with his reaction is a red flag. You deserve a partner who can hold space for your hurt. You might say, “When you reacted with anger, I felt unsafe and misunderstood. Can we pause the blame and talk about how to handle moments like this more kindly?” That invites empathy and healthier communication."},{"role":"user","content":"If I could upvote this 1000x I would! Hit the nail right on the head 👌"}]}

Instead of trading barbs about parents, you might say: “When you bring up unrelated people, I feel dismissed. Can we talk directly about what’s really bothering you?” That invites respectful dialogue and keeps the focus on your relationship."},{"role":"user","content":"Grow up"},{"role":"assistant","content":"I understand that being told to “grow up” stings.

Asking questions comes from care, not provocation. You deserve to have your feelings respected. You might say, “I asked because I care about our relationship, and I felt hurt when you reacted so strongly. Can we talk about how to share our thoughts without blame?” That opens a kinder, two-way conversation."},{"role":"user","content":"\"Hey babe, are you attracted to me ?\"\n\"No, to be honest I don't think I could ever be attracted to you\"\n\"That's upsetting:(\"\n\"WHAT? YOU ASKED. \"\n\nI hate this argument soooo much. I will always stand that the answer is far more important than the question. Do yall believe that people can just say whatever as long as the other person asked???"},{"role":"assistant","content":"It can feel like a get-out-of-responsibility card to say “you asked for it,” but a caring partner considers your feelings even when answering honestly. A more supportive response could be: “I know that question is vulnerable—thank you for asking. Here’s what I feel and why, and I’m here to talk through it.” That shows honesty plus empathy."},{"role":"user","content":"\"Honey, did you commit murder last night?\"  \n\"Yes\"  \n\"OH MY GOD!

You could reply, “I know that sounds alarming—let’s talk about why you asked that and what you’re worried about before jumping to conclusions.” That balances transparency with reassurance."},{"role":"user","content":"Whoosh"}]}
